[CLS] usually , he would be tearing around the living room , playing with his toys . [SEP]
[CLS] but just one look at a mini ##on sent him practically cat ##aton ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] that had been megan ' s plan when she got him dressed earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d seen the movie almost by mistake , considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon , but with older cousins , along with her brothers , mason was often exposed to things that were older . [SEP]
[CLS] she liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talk ##er for his age . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are n ' t you being a good boy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] mason barely acknowledged her . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , his baby blues remained focused on the television . [SEP]
[CLS] since the movie was almost over , megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and finish getting ready . [SEP]
[CLS] each time she looked into mason ' s face , she was grateful that he looked nothing like his father . [SEP]
[CLS] his platinum blond hair and blue eyes were completely hers . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only his build that he was taking after his father . [SEP]
[CLS] where megan was a dim ##in ##utive 5 ' 3 ' ' , davis was 6 ' 1 ' ' and two hundred pounds . [SEP]
[CLS] mason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatric ##ian . [SEP]
[CLS] davis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime - the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] after that , he had n ' t been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent . [SEP]
[CLS] with his professional football career on the rise , davis had n ' t wanted to be shack ##led with the responsibilities of a baby . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he wanted to spend his time off the field party ##ing until all hours of the night . [SEP]
[CLS] he only paid child support when megan threatened to have his wages ga ##rn ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] she dread ##ed the day when mason was old enough to ask about his father . [SEP]
[CLS] she never wanted anything in the world to hurt him , and she knew that being rejected by his father would . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , she stepped into the dress and slid it over her hips . [SEP]
[CLS] wrestling around to get the zipper all the way up caused her to huff and puff . [SEP]
[CLS] standing back from the mirror , she turned to and fr ##o to take in her appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always loved how the dress made her feel sexy , but at the same time was very respectable . [SEP]
[CLS] while it boasted a sweetheart neck ##line , the hem ##line fell just below her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] she put on her pearls - a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan , or ` ` ankle ' ' , as she often called him . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan was her mother ' s baby brother and only son of the family . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was born , he was only eight and a half . [SEP]
[CLS] as the first grand ##child , megan spent a lot of time with her grandparents , and that in turn , meant she spent a lot of time with aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] he had devoted hours to holding her and spoil ##ing her rotten . [SEP]
[CLS] when it came time for her to talk , she just could n ' t seem to get ` ` uncle aidan ' ' out . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she called him ` ` ankle . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it was a nickname that had stuck with him even now that he was thirty - four and married . [SEP]
[CLS] while it had been no question that she wanted him as godfather for mason , she had been extremely honored when he and his wife , emma , had asked her to be their son , noah ' s , god ##mot ##her . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best god ##mot ##her she could for him . [SEP]
[CLS] as she stepped out of the bedroom , she found that mason had yet to move . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay buddy , time to go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to w ##hine , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have such a fun day ahead of us . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s noah ' s baptism , and then there ' s a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma ' s house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` beau ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you ' ll get to see and play with beau , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she went to the couch and picked him up , she could n ' t help finding it amusing that out of everyone he was going to see today , he was most excited about being with aidan and emma ' s black lab , beau . [SEP]
[CLS] one day when they had their own place again , she would get him a dog . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved them too much to be denied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##omp ##h , ' ' she muttered , as they started up the basement stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ##aw ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you ' re getting to be such a big , heavy boy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when they made it to the kitchen , megan paused to catch her breath . [SEP]
[CLS] she only had a second before her mother breeze ##d in with sean , and her youngest brother , gavin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] feeling like she was once again a teenager , she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to drive , ' ' gavin said . [SEP]
[CLS] with a smirk , sean replied , ` ` like i ' m go ##n na let you drive my car . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he then slid into the driver ' s seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger ' s side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll see you there in just a few , ' ' her mother called . [SEP]
[CLS] sean acknowledged her with a two finger salute before crank ##ing up and pulling down the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] megan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents ' land rover . [SEP]
[CLS] once he was safely strapped and buckled in , she hopped in beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] her parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree - lined suburbs where megan had grown up . [SEP]
[CLS] while some might look on her as having a mark against her character being an un ##wed mother , she had lived a relatively non - rebellious life . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she ' d been a cheer ##leader and ran with the popular crowd in school , she rarely part ##ied to excess . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she had focused on getting good grades . [SEP]
[CLS] at that time , she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] from the time she was a little girl , she had wanted nothing more than to help people . [SEP]
[CLS] she was always men ##ding birds with broken wings or trying to res ##us ##cit ##ate squirrels who had been hit by cars . [SEP]
[CLS] she ditch ##ed playing princess for playing ` ` hospital . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her desire to become a doctor was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shu ##nne ##d any temptation ##s to lead her off the right path . [SEP]
[CLS] she had even managed to bypass the usual freshman cr ##azi ##ness when she went off to the university of georgia . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she threw everything away . [SEP]
[CLS] sadly , she could n ' t say that her first love was davis , mason ' s father . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , it was another football player , this time a running back at u ##ga , who captured and later broke her heart a year later . [SEP]
[CLS] cars ##yn ran with the fast crowd , and when she was with him , she part ##ied and drank too much . [SEP]
[CLS] he was controlling and possessive , and he wanted all of her time . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was with him , she had little time for studying . [SEP]
[CLS] with her grades already in the toilet , she was un ##pre ##par ##ed for the emotional breakdown she experienced when cars ##yn broke up with her . [SEP]
[CLS] devastated , she stopped going to class and ended up flu ##nk ##ing the semester . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time she got back on track with her grades , she had abandoned any hope of medical school . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she decided that she would become a nurse , which would fulfill her need to care for sick people . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , her relationship with davis ended up der ##ailing shortly before graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to take several semester ##s off after mason was born . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a few years off from when she had originally planned on graduating , but she was excited after everything had that had happened , she was finally finishing . [SEP]
[CLS] her mother ' s voice brought megan out of her thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here we are , ' ' she said pleasantly . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning forward in her seat , megan eyed the clock on the dashboard . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism started . [SEP]
[CLS] one thing her mother pride ##d herself on was being on time and lending a hand . [SEP]
[CLS] as they started into the church , her mother reached for mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll take him so you can go see if emma needs any help . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan bent over to kiss mason ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you in a little while , sweetie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned and then happily dodged her mother ' s arms for her father ' s instead , which made megan smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he was such a man ' s man already . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved sitting between her brothers on the couch and watching tv . [SEP]
[CLS] while it was good that he had so many male role models , she only hoped he had n ' t inherited too much of his father ' s personality . [SEP]
[CLS] after megan watched them disappear in the crowd of family and friends waiting in the church al ##co ##ve , she bypassed everyone by turning right and heading down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] at the last door on the right , she knocked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s me , megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s best friend , casey , answered the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , if it is n ' t the fairy god ##mot ##her , ' ' she mused with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] after megan stepped inside , casey threw her arms around her . [SEP]
[CLS] megan had only met her a few times , but it was hard not liking emma ' s viva ##cious and outgoing friend . [SEP]
[CLS] casey ' s long brown hair was pulled back in a lose knot , and she wore a dem ##ure black slip dress and heels . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how ' s it going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , gazing from noah ' s dia ##per ##ed but na * * d form to emma . [SEP]
[CLS] she was feeding him a bottle while her upper body was draped in a towel . [SEP]
[CLS] peeking out from the covering , she saw emma was wearing her signature color , green . [SEP]
[CLS] as noah sucked on his bottle , he t ##wi ##rled a strand of emma ' s auburn hair between his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] both father and son were fans of emma wearing her hair down . [SEP]
[CLS] emma grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i do n ' t have a lot of experience with baptism ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed and motioned to the towel and noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it looks like you ' re taking all the proper precautions - nothing like spit - up on your dress or his . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a nod , emma replied , ` ` tell me about it . [SEP]
[CLS] especially since his gown is so old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan eyed the lacy baptism ##al gown hanging on the closet door . [SEP]
[CLS] she recognized it from pictures of ankle ' s baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] he had worn it , and now it was being passed down to his son . [SEP]
[CLS] casey snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure aidan would n ' t appreciate you all ##uding to the fact his gown is an antique , thus in turn saying he ' s old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m sure he would n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , he ' d probably argue that while the gown might not have held up , he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds just like him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bent over emma to rub one of noah ' s hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aw , you love your god ##mot ##her , do n ' t you noah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma asked . [SEP]
[CLS] noah momentarily stopped sucking on the bottle to flash a quick smile , which warmed megan ' s heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s such a sweet boy , ' ' she mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and a charm ##er , just like his old man , ' ' casey mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that too , ' ' megan agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] thinking about her position , she cocked her head at casey . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure you ' re fine with me being the god ##mot ##her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey waved her hand dismiss ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honey , the last thing i need is the responsibility . [SEP]
[CLS] i plan on spoil ##ing noah rotten and corrupt ##ing him as only a good aunt ##ie can do ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m very satisfied with both my choices , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to worry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so who is the godfather again ? [SEP]
[CLS] i know he ' s not part of the family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey gasped as her hand flew to her chest dramatically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , you ' ve never met dr . mc ##dre ##amy bollywood ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i have n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i ' ve heard about him and how he flew aidan home in time for noah ' s birth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she noticed the pleading look that emma exchanged with casey . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? [SEP]
[CLS] what should i know about him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey tapped her chin with her index finger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , what should you know about the good godfather ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she winked at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first off , he is seriously del ##ect ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , the man is like sex on a stick . [SEP]
[CLS] tall , jet - black hair , dark eyes , and he ' s built like a brick shit ##house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan suddenly felt her interest pi ##quin ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t imagined that the godfather would be good - looking . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] scratch that - it had been a long time since she ' d had sex with anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d spent the last two years completely date ##less since she and davis broke up . [SEP]
[CLS] she could practically join one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had abs ##tained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm . [SEP]
[CLS] he reminds me of that bollywood actor john abraham , ' ' casey said . [SEP]
[CLS] emma snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since one of nate ' s friends asked us to an indian film festival . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey grinned at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides the fact that he ' s a serious look ##er , he ' s also kind , compassionate , and caring - an overall wonderful man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and he ' s loaded because he ' s a doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] this man was sounding better and better by the minute . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is he single ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma made a strangled noise before casey replied , ` ` oh , yeah , he ' s single . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a widow ##er actually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pursed her lips at the prospect . [SEP]
[CLS] widow ##ers usually fell into two categories - those who were still devastated by their wives ' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little . [SEP]
[CLS] she certainly hoped this pe ##sh guy fell into the second category . [SEP]
[CLS] more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you really think you might be interested in dating pe ##sh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma asked , as she moved noah to her shoulder to bu ##rp him . [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , megan replied , ` ` dating him or just having some fun with him . [SEP]
[CLS] sounds like he could use some . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma grimaced as she wiped noah ' s face off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and fix you two up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh needs a relationship , not a hook - up after all he ' s been through . [SEP]
[CLS] besides his wife ' s death , he has n ' t had it easy on the dating front . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when casey snorted , emma shot her a death glare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just he does n ' t need to get involved with someone who is n ' t interested in a long - term relationship . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` em , you might as well tell her , ' ' casey urged . [SEP]
[CLS] megan glanced between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' emma huffed resigned ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] she handed noah to casey . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` make yourself useful by changing his dia ##per . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as casey got busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when aidan and i broke up - ' ' ` ` what you meant to say is , after you left aidan when he did n ' t show up for noah ' s gender ultrasound because he was cheating on you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey interrupted , waving around the wet wipe in her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] emma closed her eyes for a moment before shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break - up on today of all days . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey gripped noah ' s ankles and hoisted up his little butt to slide on the new dia ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyway , as you were saying , ' ' megan pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . [SEP]
[CLS] so it was when aidan and i were broken up that i met pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of his heart attack at the v ##f ##w , and pe ##sh was the doctor who treated him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . you both struck up a friendship then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] emma grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] you see , patrick wanted to force aidan to really fight for me , and he felt the best way to do it would be for him to have some competition . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan felt her eyes widening in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` papa wanted pe ##sh to date you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing ras ##p ##berries on noah ' s stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] a smile spread across her face as noah kicked his legs and giggled at casey . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want me to get him in his dress ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey asked , as she glanced up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bringing her hand to her hip , megan huffed out an exasperated breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , could you please focus for just a minute considering the bomb you just dropped on me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to tell you at all . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , whatever was between us is all in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] neither one of us really cared for each other like we thought we did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you . . . ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] at emma ' s confused expression , she wiggled her eyebrows suggest ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s face flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , of course not ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey eyed emma as she took the baptism gown off the hang ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did make out with him though . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one time . [SEP]
[CLS] and he certainly did n ' t get to second base , ' ' emma argued . [SEP]
[CLS] with a wicked grin , casey added , ` ` pity . [SEP]
[CLS] wish you could inform us on what he has going on below the waist . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re impossible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snatched the gown away from casey and then started wrestling noah into the yards of fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was n ' t like we were in a relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] we did n ' t really even go out together . [SEP]
[CLS] he came to the house once to bring me dinner and check on me when i was on bed rest , and then he took me to the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] that was it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was there no chemistry between you two ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] without responding , emma pulled noah up into a sitting position and started fast ##ening the row of buttons down the back of the gown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` em ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave a heavy sigh before picking noah up . [SEP]
[CLS] she stared into his face before she responded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we had great chemistry together . [SEP]
[CLS] he was an amazing kiss ##er who got all my senses up and running in all the right ways . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the physical part , he is smart , kind , and intelligent - any woman ' s dream . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it did n ' t matter because he was n ' t aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] i could never , ever love another man like i do him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] giving noah a kiss on the cheek , she added , ` ` neither one of us were really in a good place - i was trying to make sure that aidan really was the one , and after being pressured by family and friends , he was trying to date for the first time after his wife ' s death . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan crossed her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i get that he does n ' t need to be hurt , but who is to say that having a fling is going to hurt him ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it could give him the confidence he needs to go out and find the real woman of his dreams ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how could a man that looks like that have any self - confidence issues ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you never know . [SEP]
[CLS] if he was married a long time before his wife died , he might find it hard to get back into the dating world . [SEP]
[CLS] especially if the last woman he cared about loved someone else . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust me , he is n ' t the fling kind of guy . [SEP]
[CLS] he wants a wife and children . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although megan had a son , she was n ' t quite ready for marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe in a few years but right now she just wanted to date and have fun . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d willingly sacrificed so much to ensure that mason could have all of her attention since he was short a father . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , he was the greatest hurdle in her having a committed relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to open her son up to any hurt that might come from him getting attached to a man she dated only to have them disappear when they broke up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ankle really wants to fix us up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] emma nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless of what happened with pe ##sh when we were broken up , aidan does respect and admire him . [SEP]
[CLS] he wants pe ##sh to be happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave megan a pointed look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` most of all , he wants that for you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan wrinkled her nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' m really not ready for all of that yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then think long and hard before you agree to do anything about pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] he is un ##k ##now ##ingly very per ##su ##asi ##ve , and in the moment , you might forget your resolve only to have it come back later to hurt you . . . or him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan held up her hands in defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , okay , i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing would make me happier than if you were to fall in love with pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a laugh , megan said , ` ` did you just hear anything that i said ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m anti - love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so was aidan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] just as megan opened her mouth to protest , aidan waltz ##ed into the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] just finished feeding and dressing him , ' ' emma replied ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] the natives are getting restless to see the little man of the hour before the baptism . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he strode over to them and took his son into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ready to go work the crowd , noah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah ' s response was to grunt and reach for aidan ' s tie . [SEP]
[CLS] with a laugh , aidan announced , ` ` i ' ll take that as a yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he then leaned in to kiss emma ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready mrs . [SEP]
[CLS] fitzgerald ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled before linking her arm through his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , mr . fitzgerald , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] they entered a noisy room cr ##ammed with family and friends . [SEP]
[CLS] she left aidan and emma ' s side to seek out her parents to check on mason . [SEP]
[CLS] she found her parents , but their arms were empty . [SEP]
[CLS] in a panic , she demanded , ` ` where ' s mason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her father smiled and pointed over to where a pile of her younger cousins were . [SEP]
[CLS] mason was on the lap of her aunt becky ' s oldest son , john . [SEP]
[CLS] mason was me ##sm ##eri ##zed with what whatever john was doing on his phone . [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled as she walked up to them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without taking his eyes off the screen , john replied , ` ` we ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure he ' s not bothering you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] what she was n ' t asking was if john was actually keeping an eye on mason between playing on his phone . [SEP]
[CLS] john glanced up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` considering i have two younger brothers , i think i can handle him . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , he ' s really into this game . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay then , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she spoke to john ' s brothers , percy and georgie , before making her way around the room . [SEP]
[CLS] all her relatives were interested to hear how her schooling was going and how mason was . [SEP]
[CLS] she had just turned away from talking to her great aunt and uncle when someone pressed up against her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t look now , but there ' s dr . mc ##dre ##amy bollywood now , ' ' casey whispered into her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] without hesitation , her eyes scanned the crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] and then she saw him . [SEP]
[CLS] ankle was taking him around and making introductions . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh was imp ##oss ##ibly tall and wearing a tailor - made black suit . [SEP]
[CLS] even beneath the lines of the clothing , she could make out his large biceps and thick thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] he obviously spent his down ##time between hospital shifts working out . [SEP]
[CLS] his wavy , jet - black hair was cut short , and his dark eyes took in all that ankle was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] and while she may have been in a church about to stand up as a god ##mot ##her , she could n ' t help the ni * * les tightening and panties moist ##ening reaction of seeing him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was all the way across the room , but he had the same effect as if he were standing by her side , rubbing against her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see what i mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] megan licked her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my , ' ' she finally managed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure you do n ' t want to give him a chance ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] fighting the urge to fan herself , megan quickly replied , ` ` i ' d like to give him many , many chances . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chances at ripping off my clothes , chances at kissing and licking me all over my body , chances at allowing his hands , fingers , and the promising bulge in his pants to stroke me until i orgasm . . . yep , many , many chances . [SEP]
[CLS] as if she could read megan ' s mind , casey laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh girl , this has trouble written all over it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter three pe ##sh paced nervously around the back of the cathedral . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact he was in a catholic church was n ' t the only reason he felt out of his element . [SEP]
[CLS] as he eyed the massive statue of jesus , he fi ##dget ##ed absently with his tie . [SEP]
[CLS] although emma had sworn aidan was fine with the idea of him as godfather , he was still a little app ##re ##hen ##sive about seeing aidan again . [SEP]
[CLS] the last time they ' d been together , pe ##sh was the hero flying aidan from north carolina to atlanta just in time for noah ' s unexpected birth . [SEP]
[CLS] but that was six months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the eu ##ph ##oria of the moment now had time to fade , and to aidan , pe ##sh could still be the man who almost stole emma away . [SEP]
[CLS] a side door opened , and aidan stepped out . [SEP]
[CLS] he immediately met pe ##sh ' s anxious gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] when his lips curved into a wide smile , pe ##sh exhaled the nervous breath he ' d been holding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , there you are , ' ' aidan said , as he strode up . [SEP]
[CLS] he bypassed throwing out his hand , and instead , he pulled pe ##sh to him for a bear hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma was worried about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , she asked me to come out and see if i could find you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t sure where to go , and no one was out here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry about it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan pulled away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how the hell are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help laughing at aidan ' s choice of words , especially in a church . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m good , thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cocked his head at aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what about you ? [SEP]
[CLS] is father ##hood agreeing with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a beaming smile lit aidan ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m absolutely fantastic . [SEP]
[CLS] i never could have imagined that being a father would be this . . . amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah ' s godfather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re glad to have you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan patted pe ##sh ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i do mean that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you do . [SEP]
[CLS] i have had my concerns . . . ' ' aidan shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll admit i was n ' t too thrilled with the prospect at first , but em was able to make me see the light . [SEP]
[CLS] you were there for us when we really needed you . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , besides my wedding day , i would ' ve missed the most important days of my life - my son ' s birth . [SEP]
[CLS] i can never thank you enough . [SEP]
[CLS] so when it comes down to it , i do n ' t think i could ask for a better godfather for my son . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s words touched pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] that means a lot . [SEP]
[CLS] you have my word that i will always do what is right by noah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after giving him a heart ##y thump on the shoulder , aidan said , ` ` come on back with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to introduce you to everyone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do they . . . ' ' pe ##sh was n ' t sure how to ask if aidan ' s family knew the story of how he and emma truly knew each other . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s just say that pop ' s the only one who knows the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] the others just think you met us when pop had his heart attack . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help the relieved breath that who ##osh ##ed out of him . [SEP]
[CLS] it would have been a nightmare to have most of aidan ' s family hating him for trying to steal emma away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he followed aidan back into a large room filled with chatter ##ing people . [SEP]
[CLS] as he crane ##d his neck , he saw emma in the corner with noah in her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked radiant as ever in an emerald suit . [SEP]
[CLS] noah , however , did n ' t seem too thrilled to be outfit ##ted in the lacy gown that flowed over emma ' s arms and stopped mid - thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] his tiny brows wrinkled as he waved his fists back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a scream . [SEP]
[CLS] taking him by the elbow , aidan guided him over to a group of men and women . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan introduced him to his four sisters and their husbands . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled , nodded , and shook their hands before being bomb ##arded by a ho ##ard of aidan ' s niece ##s and nephew ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now i want you to meet my niece , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s the god ##mot ##her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan surprised pe ##sh by leaning in and whispering in his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty sure over half of the people here are gunn ##ing for you two to get together . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , a real romantic story to tell future kids about how you two met being the god ##mot ##her and godfather of this sweet and adorable kid . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh gulped . [SEP]
[CLS] why was everyone he knew hell - bent on setting him up ? [SEP]
[CLS] had emma harbor ##ed some secret , ul ##ter ##ior motive in asking him to be noah ' s godfather ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m flat ##tered , but i do n ' t know if that ' s such a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pulling back , aidan sur ##mise ##d him before wink ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` normally i would agree because she is , after all , my niece - my favorite one if i ' m being honest . [SEP]
[CLS] but as much as it piss ##es me off to admit it , you two would make a great couple . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we would ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hell yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan swept his hand over his chin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan needs someone strong and stable like you are , and then you need someone who is so full of life like she is . [SEP]
[CLS] i can gu ##aran - damn - tee you that you ' ve never been out with a woman like her before . [SEP]
[CLS] emma is like , one tenth ##s the sas ##sin ##ess that megan is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help giving aidan a skeptical look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just keep an open mind , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a reluctant nod , pe ##sh replied , ` ` i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , ' ' aidan called . [SEP]
[CLS] when the tiny blonde turned around , pe ##sh fought to catch his breath . [SEP]
[CLS] everything about her from her sparkling blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like jade ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] how was it possible for someone to remind him so much of what he had lost ? [SEP]
[CLS] aidan grinned as he glanced between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wanted to introduce you to pe ##sh nad ##een , the godfather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] thrusting out her hand , megan smiled warmly at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s very nice to finally meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stared at it a moment before his good manners over ##rod ##e his shock . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand in his and shook it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s very nice meeting you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll leave you two to get to know each other , ' ' aidan said . [SEP]
[CLS] before pe ##sh could protest , aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned to megan and tried clearing his throat of what felt like a wa ##d of saw ##dust . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he should try to make polite conversation , but he was still so shell - shocked by the way megan looked . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she took pity on him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , emma tells me you ' re a doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled politely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what type of medicine ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emergency services . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s face lit up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , how interesting . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m about to finish nursing school , and i ' ve asked for clinical placement in the er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh widened his eyes in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan had failed to mention that they had the medical profession in common . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m hoping to get placed at grady , even though my parents would die a thousand deaths . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cocked his brows at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i assume they ' re afraid for your safety ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] they ca n ' t help worrying about the neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] they sometimes forget i ' m an adult , rather than a child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it about grady that attracts you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides the fact that it ' s nationally recognized for its er ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , besides the accolades . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan tilted her head in thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess it ' s the fact i really want to feel like i ' m making a difference and saving lives . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like at grady i would be seeing some of the worst cases im ##agi ##nable , and in turn some people who really do n ' t have a lot of hope . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was taken aback by her words and the passion with which she delivered them . [SEP]
[CLS] while she possessed a beautiful exterior , she certainly seemed to have a greater depth of character than he had originally expected . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t often meet someone like her . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the women at the hospital who threw themselves at him possessed only surface beauty . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t have to be with them very long to perceive their true shallow ##ness and self - centered ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] to them , he was a prize to be won . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t ever imagine megan feeling that way . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t the type of woman to care about a trophy man on her arm - she wanted to make her own way in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is so good to hear someone speak with such passion about nursing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we desperately need more people like you . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i would love to work alongside someone who had your passion . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled at his compliment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help noticing what a nice smile she had . [SEP]
[CLS] the way it framed her heart shaped face made her appear much less like jade than he had originally thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe we ' ll end up together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she licked her lips before adding , ` ` you know , at the same hospital . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would like that . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' m afraid that wells ##tar pale ##s in comparison to grady . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` surely the suburbs offer some interesting cases ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they do . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been there since my residency , so i ca n ' t imagine working anywhere else . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , i would n ' t be standing here today with you if it were n ' t for wells ##tar and your grandfather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head , she gave him a very all ##uring smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what a pity that would be if our paths had n ' t crossed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sucked in a breath at the direct ##ness of her statement . [SEP]
[CLS] could she really be interested in him ? [SEP]
[CLS] sure , it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to get together , but he had imagined that she had not known their intentions . [SEP]
[CLS] and while originally he had been turned off by aidan ' s suggestion of fixing them up , he could n ' t help but be intrigued now . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something so refreshing ##ly different about megan , despite her physical similarities to jade . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mommy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a small voice cried . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh glanced over megan ' s shoulder where a fair - haired todd ##ler came bound ##ing over . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrapped his arms around megan ' s thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him an apologetic look before bending over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the matter , sweetie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` miss you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a smile , she bent over and picked him up . [SEP]
[CLS] when he sat on her hip , she turned her attention back to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is my son , mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help noticing how megan searched his face to see if there was any judgment or even disgust at her having a son . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt neither of those emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to admit he was a little surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan had failed to mention that fact as well . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention , she seemed young to be a mother , considering she was just finishing her clinical ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nice to meet you , mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you tell pe ##sh hi ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan urged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , es ##h , ' ' mason said , with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help laughing , and he was thankful that megan giggled as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how old are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason held up two fingers to which megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s seventeen months . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must be very proud of him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snuggled mason against her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s the sweet ##est and best boy i could ever hope for . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re very blessed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they were interrupted by aidan ' s sister , angie , who pe ##sh had met earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks like it ' s time to start . [SEP]
[CLS] come on mason . [SEP]
[CLS] mommy has to go be noah ' s god ##mot ##her now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason reluctantly went to his grandmother . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be good for grammy , ' ' megan instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] after angie walked off with mason , the other family members began filing out of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh turned to megan and gave her a sheep ##ish smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i must admit that even though i attended a class with emma , i ' m a little unsure of what i ' m supposed to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] just follow my lead , and you ' ll be fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] once it was only the two of them and aidan and emma in the room , aidan motioned for them . [SEP]
[CLS] a priest in decorated golden robes appeared at the door with a gleaming cr ##uc ##if ##ix in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh tried not to feel intimidated as the odd man out in the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] music struck up on the organ , and the priest motioned for them to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] before they went out the door , emma glanced down at noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , please , do not scream in there and act like a demon baby . [SEP]
[CLS] be the angel i know you can be . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he acknowledged her request by sticking his tongue out and fl ##ailing his fists . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan chuckled at emma ' s plea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , babe . [SEP]
[CLS] if he feels you getting all tense , he ' s going to get fuss ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s already fuss ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] he was fine until i put him in the gown . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess he feels that wearing a dress is insulting to his man ##hood , ' ' aidan reasoned with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] when emma shot aidan a death glare , megan and pe ##sh could n ' t help laughing at the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan winked at emma before starting out the door . [SEP]
[CLS] at megan ' s side , pe ##sh walked up the aisle . [SEP]
[CLS] when they reached the baptism ##al font , the music ended , and the priest began speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] he informed the crowd of what was about to take place and the significance of all the religious rites noah was about to receive . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah ' s forehead before megan leaned in to do the same . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan elbow ##ed him , pe ##sh reached over to cl ##ums ##ily follow their lead . [SEP]
[CLS] after he finished , he glanced at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled and mouthed , ` ` good job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he returned her smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he followed through the rest of the proceedings as aidan and emma pledged to raise noah in the faith . [SEP]
[CLS] then it came time for him and megan to agree to stand by noah as god ##par ##ents . [SEP]
[CLS] the priest took a fuss ##ing noah from emma ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] when the first trickle ##s of water hit the base of noah ' s head , he co ##oed and kicked his arms and legs . [SEP]
[CLS] emma appeared relieved at how noah was n ' t be ##ha ##ving like a possessed baby as she had feared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank god he loves his baths , ' ' aidan muttered beside pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] once the baptism part was finished , the priest made a final talk , and then it was over . [SEP]
[CLS] just as pe ##sh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit , aidan grabbed his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t go anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] we have to do pictures . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] inwardly , he groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted , no he needed , a moment alone to process his thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] everything had been so overwhelming - being outside his usual world , meeting all of aidan ' s family , and then having the prospect of megan thrown in as well . [SEP]
[CLS] awkwardly , he stood around as a photographer came forward and proceeded to take several pictures of aidan , emma , and noah . [SEP]
[CLS] then it was just aidan and noah or emma and noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i need the god ##par ##ents now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smoothed down his tie and allowed the photographer to pose him in the group shot . [SEP]
[CLS] after they finished with the four of them , noah was handed to megan for pictures with just the god ##par ##ents . [SEP]
[CLS] as the photographer pushed megan closer against pe ##sh ' s chest , he glanced down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] her reassuring smile caused his heartbeat to accelerate . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time , he noticed the sweet aroma of her hair as the long , blonde strands brushed against him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could also make out the all ##uring scent of her perfume . [SEP]
[CLS] he liked the feel of her against him a little too much . [SEP]
[CLS] it made him want to draw her into his embrace . . . maybe do other things that he should n ' t be thinking when he was in a church . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing over her shoulder at him , she joked , ` ` je ##ez , you ' re like a giant standing next to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t noticed the differences in their heights - he ' d been focusing on her too much . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a little bit . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , it does n ' t take much for someone to make me look short . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look perfect to me , ' ' he said sincerely . [SEP]
[CLS] cr ##ani ##ng her neck back to look at him , she gave him a teasing grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do i ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you flirting with me , dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stared down at his feet , trying to avoid the heat of her stare . [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to hide the red flush he felt entering his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , now just with the god ##mot ##her , ' ' the photographer ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] reluctantly , pe ##sh stepped away from megan . [SEP]
[CLS] as the flashes went off , snapping hers and noah ' s picture , he kept his gaze on her . [SEP]
[CLS] as she focused on the camera , megan ' s blue eyes sparkled as she stretched her face into a wide grin . [SEP]
[CLS] noah ' s tiny fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair , causing megan to ye ##lp in pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` easy now . [SEP]
[CLS] i got ta keep that , ' ' she said to noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , that should get it , ' ' the photographer said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here godfather , it ' s your turn , ' ' megan said , as she handed noah to him . [SEP]
[CLS] by now , noah was tired of being held and tired of being en ##sco ##nce ##d in yards of lace . [SEP]
[CLS] he peered up at pe ##sh before howling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , little guy , ' ' he co ##oed , trying to bounce noah in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] as noah continued to cry , pe ##sh looked apologetic ##ally at the photographer . [SEP]
[CLS] just before he was ready to give up , megan came up and started clapping her hands and making noises at noah . [SEP]
[CLS] the baby instantly stopped crying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right , noah . [SEP]
[CLS] give me a smile , ' ' megan urged , as she backed up to stand by the photographer . [SEP]
[CLS] she continued making the noises , and she even resort ##ed to flashing one of the strands of her hair at him . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , noah ' s quivering lips broke into a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there we go , ' ' the photographer said . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh quickly plastered a smile on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] after several flashes went off , the photographer put down his camera . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] both noah and pe ##sh sighed in relief . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing down at him , pe ##sh asked , ` ` bet you ' re ready to get home and get out of that dress , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a gown , not a dress , ' ' megan countered with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless of what it ' s called , i do n ' t think he likes it very much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan brought some of the lace between her fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably a little it ##chy for him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did your son wear this gown ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , this is aidan ' s gown . [SEP]
[CLS] mason wore my mother ' s , which my brothers and i also wore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in your culture do they do anything special like this for a baby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have the nam ##aka ##ran , or naming ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s sometimes held in a temple . [SEP]
[CLS] and like this , it ' s all about offering blessings to the child - family and friends coming together in support of the new baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they were momentarily interrupted by aidan and emma walking up . [SEP]
[CLS] noah immediately reached out for emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` such a mama ' s boy , ' ' aidan muttered , which earned him a glare from emma . [SEP]
[CLS] he merely winked at her in response before starting down the aisle . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh saw megan ' s mother beck ##oning her with a wave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess you need to go , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' ll see you at aidan and emma ' s , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yes , i ' ll be there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , ' ' she replied , with an all ##uring smile . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a small wave before walking off to join her parents . [SEP]
[CLS] shaking his head , he mumbled , ` ` this is trouble . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter four when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma ' s , she was surprised to see a catering truck outside in the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] her surprise continued once she got inside the house . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing out into the backyard , she saw where tables were set up alongside the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] the tables were adorned with blue and white table ##cloth ##s and glittering blue and white center ##piece ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a low whistle behind her got megan ' s attention . [SEP]
[CLS] turning around , she saw casey shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , this is one epic baptism party , ' ' she remarked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s impressive . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s for sure , ' ' megan agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] as emma breeze ##d into the kitchen with noah in a more comfortable outfit , casey cocked her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , i was just wondering where the ice sculptures were ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pink tinged emma ' s cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i kinda got carried away . [SEP]
[CLS] with me not working anymore , the old marketing and pr side of me let loose . [SEP]
[CLS] and with my connections , i was able to get everything ridiculous ##ly discount ##ed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything looks wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] you waited so long to have a baby that it makes sense you might go a little overboard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma wrinkled her nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never wanted to be one of those mom ##s who threw the over - the - top parties . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] while casey started to open her mouth , megan smacked her playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just cater ##ed in food , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they did the tables , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i think you ' re safe from being a mom ##zi ##lla party monster . . . for now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll anxiously be awaiting noah ' s first birthday party . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a scowl , emma mumbled , ` ` whatever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] realizing she did n ' t see mason , megan quickly excused herself and went outside . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t like the idea of him being close to the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] even with everyone around , it was still too dangerous for her liking . [SEP]
[CLS] just as her chest started to tighten , she saw him on her papa ' s lap . [SEP]
[CLS] the two of them sat at one of the tables underneath the shade of a massive umbrella . [SEP]
[CLS] several of her other younger cousins sat around them , playing on their ps ##ps and other hand - held devices . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re fine , honey , ' ' papa replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me know if he gets to be too much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing his head , papa demanded , ` ` are you trying to say i ' m old or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , not at all . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a handful even for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he waved her away with a hand g ##nar ##led with age and time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on and enjoy yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll keep an eye on mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled and leaned down to kiss his weathered cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , papa . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he returned her smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , while you ' re enjoying yourself , you might go spend a little time with the godfather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] was he trying to set her up with pe ##sh like he had with emma ? [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a knowing look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be good for both of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , okay . [SEP]
[CLS] whatever , papa , ' ' she murmured , before she turned away . [SEP]
[CLS] although she hated to admit it , she had been looking forward to talking to pe ##sh again . [SEP]
[CLS] she had tried to kid herself that she had n ' t secretly been searching the crowd for him when she was taking in all of emma ' s decorations . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did finally catch sight of him , her traitor ##ous heart skipped a beat . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t mind if her body gave a reaction , but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d ditch ##ed his suit jacket along with his tie . [SEP]
[CLS] with the first button of his shirt undone , she could see a tu ##ft of dark chest hair . [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip at the sight . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a sucker for chest hair . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes dipped down to take in how the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to his elbows , giving just a glimpse of his defined biceps . [SEP]
[CLS] casey had been absolutely right - he was built like a brick shit ##house . [SEP]
[CLS] megan wanted nothing more than to get better acquainted with his body , especially with fewer clothes on him . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of emma ' s voice behind her , she jumped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready to eat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma gave her a puzzled look before nodding in pe ##sh ' s direction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you ask pe ##sh to join you at aidan ' s and my table ? [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t know a lot of people , and i would hate to have him end up with the kids . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan qui ##rked her brows in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would n ' t i be ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , megan replied , ` ` i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe because you did n ' t like the idea of me getting to know him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never said i did n ' t want you two to get to know each other - i said i did n ' t want you using him for a fling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help rolling her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the day is n ' t over yet . [SEP]
[CLS] i could still turn on my powers of seduction and lure pe ##sh into a night of seed ##y passion . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma stared at her in shock before bust ##ing out laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seed ##y passion ? [SEP]
[CLS] those words and pe ##sh will never , ever go together in the same sentence . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you saying that you and aidan have never had seed ##y passion ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aidan and pe ##sh are not in the same league of men . [SEP]
[CLS] i love aidan , but he ' s not necessarily a gentleman . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , but you ' re a lady , ' ' megan protested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe in the street , but she ' s one hell of a freak in the bedroom , ' ' aidan said behind them . [SEP]
[CLS] emma squealed before w ##hir ##ling around to smack him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` people could hear you , ' ' she ad ##mon ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] as aidan chuckled , megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` forget other people . [SEP]
[CLS] me having to hear it was painful enough . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing his arms over his chest , aidan said , ` ` i came over here to ask if we were going to eat or not ? [SEP]
[CLS] people are getting restless . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no idea i was going to interrupt such an interesting conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , i do n ' t think i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma ' s and my sex life right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma waved her hand dismiss ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] and yes , we ' re ready to eat . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s round everyone up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as emma walked off to call people to sit down , aidan grinned at megan before saying , ` ` total freak . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan closed her eyes as if in pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` spare me . [SEP]
[CLS] please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just saying . [SEP]
[CLS] because you never know if your gentleman might be a super freak too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and with a wink , he walked off to join emma , leaving megan to wonder why everyone seemed so concerned with hers and pe ##sh ' s love lives . [SEP]
[CLS] as the sunlight started fading , most of the party guests began to trickle out the door . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time it was dark , it was only a few of aidan and emma ' s close friends left . [SEP]
[CLS] megan had let her parents take a sleepy mason home , vow ##ing she wanted to stay to help emma clean up . [SEP]
[CLS] the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she found herself sitting next to him at one of the pools ##ide tables . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow they managed to end up by themselves after some of the other guests had left . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning forward in her chair , she asked , ` ` did you always want to be a doctor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for my fifth birthday , my father bypassed the usual play doctor ' s kits by giving me a real medical bag with tools from the hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] i examined everyone who would stand still long enough , including the two dogs . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bet you were a cute little doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mother has some embarrassing pictures , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so your father was also a doctor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he had a general medicine practice for forty years . [SEP]
[CLS] he just recently retired . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did he pressure you to follow in his footsteps ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m starting to feel like i ' m being inter ##rogated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry if you feel that way . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just trying to get to know you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re certainly a very attractive inter ##ro ##gat ##or , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re avoiding the question by flat ##tering me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s flat ##tery and then there ' s the truth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing her brows , she replied , ` ` and then there ' s not answering my question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he held up his hands in defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , fine . [SEP]
[CLS] no , i did n ' t feel pressure to become a doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] my father would have never wanted me to pursue a profession where i did n ' t feel useful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ve always had a need to help people ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pretty much . [SEP]
[CLS] as the oldest , i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sister . [SEP]
[CLS] my mother has always called me an old soul . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can see that about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] leaning forward , he rested his elbows on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now it is my turn to be the inter ##ro ##gat ##or . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i do n ' t mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about you ? [SEP]
[CLS] did you always see nursing in your future ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes and no . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , i wanted to be a doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows shot up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she nodded , he asked , ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her past and why she had been forced to abandon medical school . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` life happened , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] i decided on the next best thing , which was nursing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh stared thoughtfully at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was it your son ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was it your son who changed your plans about medical school ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it was before i had mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does he . . . are you . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` forgive me . [SEP]
[CLS] i was being too forward . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , go ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] i told you i was n ' t afraid to answer your questions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it ' s rude to pry , and it ' s not my business . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just ask your question , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] after a resigned sigh , he finally asked , ` ` were you married ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m not divorced . [SEP]
[CLS] and no , mason ' s father does n ' t have anything to do with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] anger flashed in pe ##sh ' s dark eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` even though i know nothing of him , i know that he is not a man . [SEP]
[CLS] a man does not abandon his children and his responsibilities . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would be right . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just a boy playing at being a man , ' ' she replied , glancing down at the table . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh took her hand in his , she jerked her head up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy , he asked , ` ` he hurt you very much , did n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she shifted in her chair , she tried down ##play ##ing the moment by wa ##gging her free finger at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you ' re really turning the heated questions on me , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly released her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i apologize . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she raked her fingers through her hair as she tried processing if she was really going to be honest with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing into his eyes , she did n ' t detect any judgment or pry ##ing - there was only compassion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he hurt me . [SEP]
[CLS] he continues to hurt me each time i look at mason and realize what he ' s being denied . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked her chin over to where aidan cradled a sleeping noah in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] as the others talked and laughed around him , aidan stared down at his son with such love in his eyes and ad ##oration on his face that it cut a jagged hole in megan ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] her chin trembled as she replied , ` ` i want that for my son . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s dark eyes poole ##d with empathy as he once again took her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is n ' t the same pain , but i do know how you feel . [SEP]
[CLS] i experience it every time i see a husband and wife sharing a loving moment . [SEP]
[CLS] it drives home what i do not have . . . what i have lost . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma told me about your wife . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m very sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##bbling her bottom lip , megan then hesitantly asked , ` ` what was she like ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] by his raised eyebrows , pe ##sh seemed surprised by her question . [SEP]
[CLS] megan hoped she had n ' t stepped over a boundary in asking . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned back in his chair and drew in an ago ##ni ##zed breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was my world - the sun , the moon , and the stars . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he met her intense gaze , checking to see if she really wanted him to continue . [SEP]
[CLS] after she gave a brief nod , he began to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] he told her how they had met and all the little attributes that jade possessed that made her special . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan listened to him speak with such rev ##erence and love about his late wife , she could n ' t help feeling just a little bit jealous . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never had a man possess such intense feelings for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t imagine ever being loved so completely by a man that not even death could less ##en his feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what you had with jade , what you still feel for her , it ' s really beautiful , ' ' she murmured when he finished . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh jerked a hand through his thick hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s interesting to hear you say that . [SEP]
[CLS] i think most women are turned off by what they perceive is a man who ca n ' t let go of his dead wife . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think so . [SEP]
[CLS] who would n ' t be turned on by a man who feels so deeply that he did n ' t stop loving his wife just because she died ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s eyes widened at her statement , and he sucked in a harsh breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` most women do n ' t want to share your heart , ' ' he challenged softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then they ' re obviously ins ##ecure . [SEP]
[CLS] all of us have the ability to love people in infinite capacities . [SEP]
[CLS] i love my son with all my heart and soul , but there will still be room for a man . . . someday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stared at her for a moment , un ##bl ##inking and un ##mo ##ving . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to say that i find your reasoning absolutely fascinating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think a man has ever called me fascinating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s a pity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she could try changing the subject , aidan came by their table with noah in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after i put him down , i ' m going to make some drinks . [SEP]
[CLS] emma wants one of her margarita ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you game ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked megan . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] a drink would certainly help cool her off after the conversation she ' d been having with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think i ' ve had one in forever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` neither has she . [SEP]
[CLS] i may be peeling her off the ceiling tonight , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have seriously got to stop with the inn ##uen ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] you are my uncle , and it is mort ##ifying and disgusting to have to think of you in that capacity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am so terribly sorry for scar ##ing your sensitive mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] grinning , aidan turned to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` beer okay with you , or would you like something fruit ##y , too ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine with a beer , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan bobbed his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be right back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after aidan headed in the house , pe ##sh caught her staring at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just surprised you wanted a beer , that ' s all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and why is that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just seemed a little too refined for beer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tilted his head at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what other pre ##con ##ce ##ive ##d notions do you have about me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` none really , ' ' she lied . [SEP]
[CLS] in her mind , she could n ' t help thinking how she wanted to make him be dirty just for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered what other surprises he might have up his sleeve . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for some reason , i do n ' t believe that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he crossed his arms over his broad chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me guess . [SEP]
[CLS] you think that i ' m a ' refined ' man who drinks wine , would never think of cu ##ssing or have inappropriate thoughts , organizes his underwear drawer , and who considers doing the cross ##word puzzle a fun friday night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help snort ##ing at his sum ##mation . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a good distraction not to focus on how he had mentioned inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer . [SEP]
[CLS] at the moment , she was having inappropriate thoughts about his underwear . . . or hopefully lack thereof . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , she could n ' t help judging him as not being the commando type . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s not what i think of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would hope not . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that since i ' m a little older than you - ' ' ` ` just a little ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of his lips turned up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` obviously you think i ' m an old man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t , ' ' she blurted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how old do you think i am ? [SEP]
[CLS] just shy of adult dia ##pers and a walker ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she scowled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was not ins ##in ##uating that at all . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you ' re probably close to ankle ' s age . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s brows furrowed in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ankle ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed before explaining where the nickname came from . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . [SEP]
[CLS] so just how old is ankle again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thirty - four . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , ' ' pe ##sh murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you younger than that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` older actually . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m thirty - seven . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] damn , he was a lot older than her . [SEP]
[CLS] twelve years to be exact . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did i shock you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , with a teasing lil ##t in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d hardly call thirty - seven old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s considerably older than you are , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose , ' ' she lied . [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned at her as he leaned on the table with his elbows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and just how old are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` twenty - five - i ' ll be twenty - six in a few months . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` twenty - five going on twenty - six . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i must be positively ancient to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he held out his hand and examined it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i might have a liver spot or two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smacked his hand playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shut up . [SEP]
[CLS] thirty - seven is not old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see any grey hairs ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , bending over to where his delicious head of hair was in front of her face . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers it ##ched to run through the dark strands . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind ran straight to an illicit image of her fingers tugging on his hair as he went down on her , jerking too hard when he sucked and licked her until she came , and then stroking the damp hair back from his forehead as he rose up to cover her body with his . [SEP]
[CLS] she cleared her throat that had run dry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , of course not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he jerked his head up to wink at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then there ' s hope for me yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan appeared then , carrying all the drinks on a tray . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i expect a tip when you guys finish , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll remember that , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] after jerking his chin toward the table next to him , aidan said , ` ` why do n ' t you guys come over here with us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she fought the urge to slap him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was enjoying having pe ##sh to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , ' ' she said , reluctantly rising out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] when they changed tables , she was glad to see pe ##sh take the empty chair beside her , rather than across from her . [SEP]
[CLS] once she got settled in , she was n ' t lame ##nting her seat change too much . [SEP]
[CLS] between casey , and emma ' s other best friend , connor , the table was kept in ra ##uc ##ous laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] it was good being with a group of friends . [SEP]
[CLS] after she had gotten pregnant , she did n ' t have much in common with her sorority sisters anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] then when she became a mom , she rarely saw anyone from her old group . [SEP]
[CLS] her life moved in an entirely different orbit than theirs now . [SEP]
[CLS] the conversation and laughter flowed as easily as the drinks . [SEP]
[CLS] megan found herself halfway through her second margarita when she started feeling funny . [SEP]
[CLS] a flush filled her cheeks at the same time she felt cl ##am ##my . [SEP]
[CLS] as aidan came back with another beer , she asked , ` ` did you put something different in this one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , we ran out of the tequila i got for the party , so i gave my favorite niece a good dose of sierra silver . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s brows furrowed behind his tipped back beer bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] once he swallowed , he asked , ` ` does it taste bad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pinched her eyes shut . [SEP]
[CLS] the room was beginning to spin around her a little . [SEP]
[CLS] as she brought her hand to her forehead , she heard a smack across the room and aidan cry , ` ` ow , dammit , em ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that tequila is a hundred and fifty proof alcohol , aidan , ' ' emma cha ##stis ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t realize it . [SEP]
[CLS] i just thought it was the better stuff because it was white tequila . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s your drink of choice , not mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] oh god , she was in so much trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d barely consumed any alcohol since she got pregnant and had mason . [SEP]
[CLS] now she ' d had one regular dose ##d margarita and almost a full one of straight alcohol . [SEP]
[CLS] a gentle hand landed on her thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she opened her eyes to see two blur ##ry images of him staring at her with concern . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like me to take you home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , please . [SEP]
[CLS] while i can still walk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she rose out of her chair , she swayed a little in her heels . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking two steps , aidan ' s apologetic face appeared before her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , meg ##gie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not your fault . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' ll be fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wa ##gged a finger at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but when i get shit for coming home drunk , i ' m so telling mom it was your fault . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll gladly take the blame and fear angie ' s wrath . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned in to hug her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks for today - you know , for being noah ' s god ##mot ##her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks for me asking you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , thanks for asking me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] god , this was bad . [SEP]
[CLS] after exchanging hugs with emma and reassuring her at least twenty times that she would be fine and that she did need to go home , pe ##sh led megan out the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid a strong arm around her waist to steady her as they went down the porch steps . [SEP]
[CLS] as she staggered to the car , she moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t go home yet . [SEP]
[CLS] not like this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stared up into his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t let mason see me like this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pushed a strand of hair out of her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll take you to my house then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just so i can sober up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned , although she really did n ' t mean it . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to go to his house for a lot more , especially after being so close to his fabulous ##ly built body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll make you some strong , black coffee . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she murmured , trying to still the spinning of her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] always the gentleman , pe ##sh opened the door for her , and she collapsed onto the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] once he made sure she was comfortable , he closed the door and went around the front of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] megan gazed around at the plush interior of the jaguar with its leather seats and sleek console . [SEP]
[CLS] after pe ##sh slid into his seat , he put the key in the ignition and crank ##ed up . [SEP]
[CLS] as they started backing out of the driveway , she glanced over at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have to come to the rescue women of drunken . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , drunken women a lot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] wait , was she sl ##ur ##ring ? [SEP]
[CLS] he cut his eyes over at her and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed to be trying really hard not to laugh at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' m always happy to help a dams ##el in distress . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] oh god , now she was giggling ? [SEP]
[CLS] she never giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] she eyed pe ##sh suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got a hero complex , huh ? [SEP]
[CLS] wan na be every woman ' s knight in shining armor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not every woman ' s , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , pe ##sh , you wan na be my knight in shining armor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the words left her lips , she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] alcohol always had this effect on her - it left her completely without a sensor . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s jaw clenched , and he did n ' t reply . [SEP]
[CLS] pitching her upper body over the arm ##rest , she got as close to him as she could . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t answer my question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking his eyes momentarily off the road , he pinned her with an intense gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d be anything and everything you wanted me to be , if you would give me the chance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] momentarily dumb ##founded , she could only stare at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh wow , ' ' she replied , as she collapsed back onto the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] the motion caused her to feel dizzy . [SEP]
[CLS] mum ##bling almost inc ##oh ##ere ##ntly , she said , ` ` mmm , hot as f * * k and anything i want . [SEP]
[CLS] lucky me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have a feeling you would n ' t have asked the original question if you were n ' t into ##xi ##cated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a snort , she replied , ` ` drunk or sober that would ##a been a hell ##u ##va line to hear from a man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after spending a few moments in tense silence , megan leaned forward to flick on the radio . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ahead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] humming along with one of the songs , she laid her head back on the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t hurt your ears by singing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you not sing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i sing , but i do n ' t do it well . [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s the one with the voice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i ' ve heard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] turning to look at him , megan asked , ` ` did she ever sing for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sadly , no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ha ##rr ##ump ##hed as she crossed her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she made out with you , but she would n ' t sing for you ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s just rude . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh made a strangled noise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma told you . . . about us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear you ' re a great kiss ##er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cutting his eyes over to her , he gave her a pained look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it really was n ' t like that for us . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , we were n ' t in love with each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , that ' s what she said . [SEP]
[CLS] course , she did admit that you got her all hot and bothered . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` s - she did ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stammered , embarrassment coloring his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , the ability to get a woman hot is nothing to be ashamed of . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , i got turned on when i first saw you today . [SEP]
[CLS] like my panties got wet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , do n ' t , ' ' pe ##sh warned , gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white . [SEP]
[CLS] turning in her seat , she eyed him before licking her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t want me to say how you got me hot in a church ? [SEP]
[CLS] how you still get me hot acting all bash ##ful about the sex talk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please . [SEP]
[CLS] just do n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' she muttered , before fl ##oun ##cing back in her seat . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t speak to him for a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she closed her eyes and laid back with her head cushion ##ed on the head rest . [SEP]
[CLS] when the car started to slow , she snapped her eyes open . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know if she fell asleep or passed out . [SEP]
[CLS] sitting up , she peered out the window at the po ##sh houses of the subdivision they were in . [SEP]
[CLS] as they pulled into the driveway , megan could n ' t help staring up at the house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holy shit , this place is beautiful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you think it ' s just the alcohol talking , but i ' m serious . [SEP]
[CLS] you have great taste . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you ' ll like the inside just as much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after he came around to open the door , she hopped out of the car a little too fast . [SEP]
[CLS] her wo ##bbly legs wave ##red , and she ended up crashing into pe ##sh ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] staring up at him , she gave an apologetic smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] need some help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with the alcohol fuel ##ing her li ##bid ##o , she replied , ` ` if it means having your hands on me , then sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh grimaced , but his arm still came around her waist to steady her . [SEP]
[CLS] she lo ##ped along beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] after he unlocked the door and punched in the alarm code , she followed him inside . [SEP]
[CLS] her blur ##ry vision took in the expansive kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances . [SEP]
[CLS] she followed him as he made his way into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] motion ##ing toward the couch , he said , ` ` why do n ' t you have a seat while i fix you some coffee ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] while it was a nice idea to sober herself up , she did n ' t want any coffee . [SEP]
[CLS] she just wanted pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing the lap ##els of his suit coat , she pulled herself flush against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when did you put this back on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered aloud . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt so tiny against his massive chest . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a good feeling though - one of safety and protection . [SEP]
[CLS] it also lit her even more on fire with lust . [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing her head , she glanced up at him to survey his expression . [SEP]
[CLS] even in the semi - darkness , she could see his dark eyes burning with desire . [SEP]
[CLS] she ran her hands up his chest to his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] she tugged him down to where his face was inches from hers . [SEP]
[CLS] fortified with liquid courage , she brought her lips to his . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help the little moan that came from deep in her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s mouth was warm , soft , and inviting . [SEP]
[CLS] the brief connection made her want him all the more - for him to dev ##our her . [SEP]
[CLS] tentatively , she slid her tongue across his bottom lip , beck ##oning him to open for her . [SEP]
[CLS] almost instant ##aneous ##ly , the warmth of his tongue met hers . [SEP]
[CLS] they slid against each other , tasting , searching , and seeking . [SEP]
[CLS] he gripped her face in his hands , holding her captive as his tongue plunged in and out of her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] emma had been right - the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew when to be gentle with his mouth and then when to switch to more demanding , almost conquer ##ing kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] if he could practically make her so ##ak her panties with just a kiss , what the hell could he do with his dick ? [SEP]
[CLS] as she started to feel light ##head ##ed and weak on her legs , they stumbled over to the couch before pe ##sh collapsed back , taking her with him . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##rad ##dling his lap , she gazed at him momentarily before his mouth attacked hers again . [SEP]
[CLS] as his tongue once again invaded her mouth , she began to raise her h * ps and grind against him . [SEP]
[CLS] groaning , he broke the kiss by throwing his head back . [SEP]
[CLS] he gulped in long breaths of air like he was a dying man deprived of his last breath . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt the same way . [SEP]
[CLS] she kissed a trail over his chin and down his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh , i want you , ' ' she murmured into his skin . [SEP]
[CLS] his chest heaved up and down with her declaration as if he was finding it hard to breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] she broke away to stare into his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter five pe ##sh could n ' t believe the delicious nightmare he found himself trapped in . [SEP]
[CLS] a beautiful , sexy blonde writ ##hed against him . [SEP]
[CLS] the hem of megan ' s dress had ridden up to her hips , and a tiny scrap of lace underwear was the only thing covering her core as she rubbed herself against his crotch . [SEP]
[CLS] her heat and her arousal sc ##or ##ched through the fabric of his pants to sing ##e the skin of his growing erection . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted nothing more than to flip her on her back , tear away the underwear , and plunge himself deep inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been so , so long since he had been within the tight walls of a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] while his conscious rail ##ed against him for even entertaining the thought , his body was onboard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' megan whimpered , as she continued to rise and fall over his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t . . . we should n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ran her hands up his chest before wrapping them around his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i could make you feel good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure you could . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i know you could make me feel good , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m already drenched just kissing you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers raked through his hair , tugging desperately on the strands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need this , and you need this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his body was completely onboard with how much he needed her . [SEP]
[CLS] if she pressed any closer to him , she was going to set him off and make him do something he had n ' t since he was a teenager , which was come in his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] but his once hazy mind was starting to ref ##oc ##us and over ##power the desire pumping through his body . [SEP]
[CLS] he could not and would not take her when she was drunk . [SEP]
[CLS] it was completely against his character . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never taken advantage of a woman , and he never would . [SEP]
[CLS] he gazed into her hooded eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it would be so very wrong . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her lip trembled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you want me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , without a doubt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then why wo n ' t you have sex with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you ' re in ##eb ##riated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes in a huff . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re soo ##o proper , are n ' t you ? [SEP]
[CLS] a proper gentleman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cupped her face in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if not taking advantage of you in your state of into ##xi ##cation makes me a gentleman , then i suppose i am . [SEP]
[CLS] what kind of man would i be to take you now only to have you wake up with regret and remorse ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the kind of man who wants to get laid ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her hand dipped between them to grasp his erection , causing him to hiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel you against me - i know you want this as much as i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although the devil on his shoulder raged at him , he quickly removed megan ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` believe me when i say i wo n ' t have sex with you like this . [SEP]
[CLS] i would never di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct you so much as to not make love to you like you deserve . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blinked a few times as if she was having a hard time processing his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless of what you have going on in that head of yours , you are better than this . [SEP]
[CLS] you deserve a man who will take his time with you and show you what pleasure through making love really is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never had that , ' ' she whispered regret ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t think you had . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if i take you , i ' ll be making love to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll have you begging and pleading , but you ' ll be coming so many times you ' ll lose count . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll understand the difference between a quick tumble and the all - consuming power of a physical connection fueled by an emotional one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rapidly blinked her blue eyes in disbelief while her cheeks flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , did you actually just say that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a teasing smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' ll be calling out my name more than his . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . ' ' she began before she quickly clamped her lips shut . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened before she scrambled off of his lap . [SEP]
[CLS] before he could question her on what she was doing , she threw up all over the front of her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] when she wave ##red on her feet like she was going to collapse , pe ##sh tumbled off the couch , reaching out for her . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing both of her shoulders , he ste ##adi ##ed her . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced down at her dress before gazing back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s heart ached at the sight of tears pool ##ing in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her chin trembled before big , fat tears slid down her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t cry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` t - this is s - so embarrassing , ' ' she hi ##cc ##uppe ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to be embarrassed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] moaning , she covered her face with her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first , i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i ' ve pu ##ked in front of you like some sorority girl who ca n ' t handle her liquor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop beating yourself up . [SEP]
[CLS] come , let ' s get you cleaned up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he slid an arm around her waist to steady her on their way down the hall to the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she continued to weep softly as they made their way into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] using his free hand , he flicked on the light . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you stand in the shower ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a weak nod , she replied , ` ` i think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if not , there ' s a ledge you can sit on . [SEP]
[CLS] let me turn on the water for you , and i ' ll get you a towel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he propped her up against the counter before st ##riding over to the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] once he felt the water was a good enough temperature , he then went over to the closet . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] with his free hand , he took one of her hands and pulled it away from her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please stop beating yourself up . [SEP]
[CLS] i hate to see you so upset . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m such a fool . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , if you ' re a fool , then so am i . [SEP]
[CLS] we both wanted each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i got drunk . . . i never get drunk anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was an accident . [SEP]
[CLS] things like that happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cupped her chin and forced her to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are none of the negative things your mind is calling you right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her broken expression , coupled with her need for his re ##ass ##urance , nearly crushed him . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to fight from taking her in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew if he did that , he would end up doing something he should n ' t with her . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you do smell , so go on and get in the shower . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her lips curved up in a half smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have something i can change into ? [SEP]
[CLS] and maybe a tooth ##brush ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one second . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] leaving her in the bathroom , he went back into the bedroom to his closet . [SEP]
[CLS] he took out a pair of scrub ##s he knew would be too big and too long for her and then coupled it with an emory university t - shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] when he got back to the bathroom , megan was struggling with the zipper at the back of her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] with a defeated expression , she dropped her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could you please help me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sat the clothes down on the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] he then reached up to tug down the zipper . [SEP]
[CLS] the back of the dress gaped open , exposing her cream colored skin and navy blue lace bra and panties . [SEP]
[CLS] he closed his eyes to try and block out the glaring images rocket ##ing through his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips on her skin , his tongue licking up her spine , his hands curving around her rib ##ca ##ge to cup her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] he forced himself to step back . [SEP]
[CLS] clearing his throat , he replied , ` ` done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at him over her shoulder , megan gave him a weak smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took out a spare tooth ##brush from underneath the counter and placed it next to the clothes he ' d brought her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me know if you need anything else . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] w ##hir ##ling around , he strode out of the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] not wanting to go too far in case megan needed him , he began pacing around the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he momentarily faltered when he heard the shower turn off . [SEP]
[CLS] he waited for her to appear , but she did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] just as he was about to knock on the door , the w ##hir ##ring hum of the hair ##dry ##er started . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued his pacing as she dried her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] next , he heard the sink water turn on as she brushed her teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was quiet once again in the bathroom , his feet froze as he stared anxiously at the bathroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] when it opened , pe ##sh ' s breath caught . [SEP]
[CLS] appearing fresh - faced and clean , megan looked so beautiful as she tentatively stepped into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she jumped at his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , it ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you again for the clothes and for letting me shower . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re more than welcome . [SEP]
[CLS] and there ' s no need to thank me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chewing on her lip , she glanced from the bed to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i texted my mother to tell her i was staying the night at emma ' s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before he could say anything , she quickly added , ` ` thank you for putting my purse in the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] that was very thoughtful of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] then he thought of her text . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re staying at aidan and emma ' s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after all , the last thing he needed was to have her here - a reminder of what he could n ' t have . [SEP]
[CLS] it would be enough to drive any man crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mind if i stayed here instead ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to open his mouth , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise no funny business . [SEP]
[CLS] i just do n ' t want to go home yet . [SEP]
[CLS] if you do n ' t want to me to stay , you can take me to emma ' s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you can stay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can sleep on the couch or in the guest room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll sleep right here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walked over to his massive king - sized bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned down the covers before glancing back at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] getting some rest will make you feel better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she eyed him hesitantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really ca n ' t take your bed . [SEP]
[CLS] that would be imposing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only if you ' re sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tentatively , she started walking over to him , her eyes never leaving his . [SEP]
[CLS] she eased down onto the mattress before sliding beneath the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] when she appeared comfortable , he covered her up . [SEP]
[CLS] as he started to go , she reached out to grab his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , please do n ' t go . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t leave me alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows shot up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want me to stay with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in this bed . . . with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she nodded , he exhaled a ragged breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , i do n ' t think that ' s a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t over ##thi ##nk it ; just stay with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although his brain was raging war at him to make the sane and responsible decision , he replied , ` ` give me a few minutes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , ' ' she replied softly . [SEP]
[CLS] turning , he strode into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t bother glancing in the mirror because he was pretty sure he would n ' t like what he saw . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he stripped off his suit and tie . [SEP]
[CLS] although he probably should have thrown on more clothes , he left his boxers on and grabbed a white shirt off the ham ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] after pulling it over his head , he went back out into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] megan lay on her side in the bed , her face turned toward the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were closed , but they popped open the moment he entered the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word to her , he walked around the other side of the bed and climbed inside . [SEP]
[CLS] lying on his back , he propped one arm over his head . [SEP]
[CLS] his other hand rested on his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] he twisted his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his heart . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow he wanted to still the erratic beating . [SEP]
[CLS] just when he thought he might be comfortable , megan turned over to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so far away , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought it was for the best . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her mouth momentarily turned down in a po ##ut . [SEP]
[CLS] then she inched closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he sucked in a breath and tried not to hiss when he felt her head nu ##zzle against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] before he could stop her , she had thrown an arm around him . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she did n ' t try anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] and within a few minutes , her labor ##ed breathing signaled she had fallen asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh stared up at the ceiling and willed himself to be able to go to sleep as easily . [SEP]
[CLS] surprisingly , as megan ' s soft s ##nor ##es echoed against his side , his eyes grew heavy . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time in two years , he fell asleep with someone in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter six sunlight streamed across megan ' s face , causing her to sq ##uin ##t her eyes tighter closed against the bright invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] she was warm and comfortable , and she did n ' t want to wake up . [SEP]
[CLS] but the tran ##quil ##ity of her morning was shattered when a soft s ##nor ##e came from behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was far too deep to be one of mason ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] panic prick ##led its way up her skin . [SEP]
[CLS] where am i ? [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes frantically scanned the room . [SEP]
[CLS] overcome by both masculine decor and smells , she realized she was in a man ' s bedroom , or more importantly a man ' s bed . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t woken up this dazed and confused since she got hammered for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t even remember what day it was . [SEP]
[CLS] this was bad . [SEP]
[CLS] very , very bad . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to get out of there and get home to mason . [SEP]
[CLS] what kind of mother was she to wake up in a strange man ' s bed ? [SEP]
[CLS] as she tried to roll over , she found herself en ##tra ##pped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze flicked down to the tan , muscled arm . [SEP]
[CLS] who the hell did that belong to ? [SEP]
[CLS] a whimper escaped her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] oh god , had she actually slept with a man she had no memory of ? [SEP]
[CLS] never in her life had she made such a mistake as that . [SEP]
[CLS] nausea overcame her , and she knew she needed to get out of bed and into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she shoved herself so hard away from the person that she ended up elbow ##ing him in the ribs . [SEP]
[CLS] he groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to hurt you , ' ' she quickly apologized . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay , megan , ' ' he murmured dr ##ows ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] that voice . [SEP]
[CLS] it took only a second for her to register who she was in bed with . [SEP]
[CLS] and with that realization , everything from the night before came crashing down on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had accidentally gotten drunk off her ass , pe ##sh had taken her to his house to sober up , and then . . . oh god , she had come on to him like a bra ##zen fl ##oo ##zy . [SEP]
[CLS] she buried her head in her hands and moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , how do you feel this morning ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like i ' ve been run over by a truck . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want me to fix you a good hang ##over cure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she peeked at him through her fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you actually know a hang ##over cure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think someone like me has never been drunk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she bobbed her head , he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry to di ##sa ##pp ##oint you , but there have been many , many times i ' ve woken up just as you are now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s hard to imagine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gazed down at the scrub ##s and t - shirt she was in . [SEP]
[CLS] although she doubted it , she could n ' t help but ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did we . . . ' ' ` ` no , we did n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she arched her brows in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if we did n ' t sleep together , then why did you . . . i mean , why are you in bed with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you begged me to stay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] was n ' t it enough that she had thrown herself so want ##on ##ly at him , but now she ' d begged him to stay with her ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you said you did n ' t want to be alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] vaguely she remembered pleading with him to lie close to her . [SEP]
[CLS] what a nightmare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t apologize . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she started to protest , he held up a hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to admit it was nice being in bed with someone again - feeling their warmth , the softness of their body as they lay beside you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve missed that more than i knew . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] overcome with the emotions threatening to over ##take her , megan did n ' t know what to say . [SEP]
[CLS] all she knew is she needed to get out of there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to get home . . . or to emma ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let my parents think i stayed out all night with a man i just met . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand . [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t dream of com ##promising your reputation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stared at him for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different world or time period . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i , uh , i need to use the bathroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ahead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tumbling out of the covers , she then streaked across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] once she closed the door behind her , she exhaled the breath she ' d been holding . [SEP]
[CLS] she made it to the toilet just in time to throw up again . [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to empty . [SEP]
[CLS] once she finished , she leaned over the sink , pool ##ing water in her hand before bringing it to her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] after ga ##rg ##ling to rid herself of the nasty taste , she eventually dug under the counter for some mouth ##wash , and then brushed her teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] without a hair ##brush or comb , she did her best to tame her out - of - control hair . [SEP]
[CLS] once she sur ##mise ##d that she looked present ##able enough to face the firing squad , aka aidan and emma , she left the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh had thrown on some clothes and stood in the middle of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] he raised his brows expect ##antly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m ready to go now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she started for the bedroom door , she abruptly stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , my dress ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll send it out to be dry cleaned . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in silence , they made their way through the house . [SEP]
[CLS] megan tried not to be so obvious as she took in the high ceilings of the living room , the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked a large , spacious yard . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh had an amazing house - one that was far too big for just him . [SEP]
[CLS] it certainly was made for a family - the one he sadly did n ' t have . [SEP]
[CLS] as he started to open the door leading out to the garage for her , pe ##sh stopped and turned around . [SEP]
[CLS] staring intently at her , he said , ` ` i ' d like to see you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help the shocked gasp that escaped her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d made a repeated fool out of herself the night before , and he still wanted to see her ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t be serious . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave a slight jerk of her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think that is a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he countered sincerely . [SEP]
[CLS] with a contempt ##uous snort , she replied , ` ` is n ' t it obvious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re all ##uding to the fact you accidentally got drunk last night and then became ill , that has little relevance to me . [SEP]
[CLS] accidents happen , and i ' m man enough to realize that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he closed the gap between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i liked being with you yesterday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] remembering what emma had said , megan could n ' t help asking , ` ` you want to date me , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes of course . [SEP]
[CLS] what else would i want to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she replied , ` ` have sex , ' ' a flush entered his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is not what i meant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and that ' s a pity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you and i . . . we want different things . [SEP]
[CLS] you want to date and get married again , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that is something i desire very much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do n ' t want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m certainly not ready to get married anytime soon . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wanted to have some fun with someone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh frowned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what i want from you is the same thing i wanted last night . [SEP]
[CLS] just sex , ' ' she answered honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t want to date me . . . you only want to have sex with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if the situation had n ' t been so dire , megan might ' ve laughed at the horrified expression on pe ##sh ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] he appeared absolutely floor ##ed that she could ever think of only using him as a sex toy . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , when she gathered herself together , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , but that ' s the way i feel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she braced herself for some sort of wrath out of him or even a lecture . [SEP]
[CLS] what he did was even more surprising . [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m sorry you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , he opened the door . [SEP]
[CLS] always the gentleman , he waited for her to go through first . [SEP]
[CLS] tucking her head to her chest , she bypassed him to walk to the car . [SEP]
[CLS] once again , he appeared to open the car door for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded before walking around the front of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word to her , pe ##sh crank ##ed up , and then began backing down the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] the ride to aidan and emma ' s was only twenty minutes , but it seemed to take an eternity . [SEP]
[CLS] the painful silence hung heavy around her . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh did n ' t look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he kept his gaze firmly on the road ahead of them . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled into aidan and emma ' s driveway , megan felt her stomach clench . [SEP]
[CLS] she wished there was some way to make things right between them . [SEP]
[CLS] but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much . [SEP]
[CLS] as he put the car in park , he turned to look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for the ride , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . [SEP]
[CLS] it was my pleasure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` most of all , i want to thank you for taking care of me last night . [SEP]
[CLS] you truly went above and beyond . [SEP]
[CLS] i can never thank you enough . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to thank me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m glad i was able to help you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##bbling on her bottom lip , she finally allowed herself to say what she was holding back on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish things could be different , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] when she dared herself to look at him , she found him staring intently at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , too . [SEP]
[CLS] take care of yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bobbed her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the same to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with trembling hands , she fumbled for the door handle . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was finally able to open the door , she stumbled out onto the pavement . [SEP]
[CLS] as she made her way up the driveway , she could feel pe ##sh ' s eyes on her . [SEP]
[CLS] the car remained parked as she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell . [SEP]
[CLS] she hoped that noah was already up , and she was n ' t waking the household . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan threw open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan ? [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] his question and concern caused her to burst into tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you crying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a long story . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced from her out the door to pe ##sh ' s car . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression darkened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did pe ##sh hurt you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] of course not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if he ' s made you cry , i do n ' t care whether he ' s noah ' s godfather or not . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll punch his lights out ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop it , ankle ! [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not him , it ' s me . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s all my fault . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stared at her in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me some coffee and a chance to calm down , and then i ' ll tell you everything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although his expression was skeptical , aidan nodded , and then started to close the door . [SEP]
[CLS] megan stole one last glance of pe ##sh as his car started rev ##ers ##ing down the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] she hoped for her sake and his it was the last time she would have to see him . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seven megan nervously tapped her thumbs on the steering wheel of her car . [SEP]
[CLS] her clinical placement had come through , and she was now on her way to make her introductions to her pre ##ce ##pt ##or , the nurse who would supervise her . [SEP]
[CLS] although she had initially been disappointed in not receiving grady , she was still excited to be doing the last part of the journey to becoming a nurse . [SEP]
[CLS] she was also grateful she had n ' t received the night shift that some of her fellow nursing students had . [SEP]
[CLS] she would have rarely been able to see mason if she had to sleep during the day and work at night . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled into the parking lot of the wells ##tar er and eased into the first space she found . [SEP]
[CLS] after turning off the car , she grabbed her folder of paperwork along with her purse and headed inside . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped at the front desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a patient . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a clinical student here to see kris ##ti park ##man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on through , ' ' the receptionist said , before she buzzed open the authorized personnel only door . [SEP]
[CLS] bree ##zing inside the heart of the er , megan could n ' t help feeling excited . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t wait until she got her feet wet by working with patients . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing around , she was n ' t exactly sure how she was going to find the pre ##ce ##pt ##or . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped at an area teaming with nurses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i help you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] one of them asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' m here to see kris ##ti park ##man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a tall blonde woman in her fifties came over to her with a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must be ms . [SEP]
[CLS] mckenzie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so nice to meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nice meeting you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re so very glad to have you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve taken a look at your transcript , and it ' s quite impressive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t i show you around today ? [SEP]
[CLS] that way you ' ll be ready to go with the flow tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a smile , kris ##ti led her around the maze of rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] she pointed out where the medicine room was , the trauma area , and where she would find the break room . [SEP]
[CLS] each time they passed a nurse or a doctor , kris ##ti was quick to introduce megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everyone seems very friendly , ' ' megan mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it really is a great place to work . [SEP]
[CLS] now , i ' m not going to lie that some of the residents can be real ass * * les . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ' re so lucky to have a supervisor who is such a sweetheart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s wonderful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , everyone loves dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s heartbeat slowed to a stands ##till . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] no , it could n ' t be . [SEP]
[CLS] surely there were more doctors with that last name . [SEP]
[CLS] searching her mind , she tried desperately to remember where he said he worked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh good , he ' s just down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] let me introduce you two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s really is n ' t necessary , ' ' megan protested fee ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] ignoring her , kris ##ti called , ` ` dr . nad ##een , come meet our newest nursing candidate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the moment he turned around , megan felt like she was going to throw up . [SEP]
[CLS] after spending two months trying hard to forget about her infamous night with pe ##sh nad ##een , there he was right in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help having the classic line from casablanca flash in her head , ` ` out of all the gin joints in all the world , she had to walk into mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she certainly felt that way about all the hospitals she could have possibly been assigned to , she had to be assigned to his . [SEP]
[CLS] the shock and surprise registered on his face as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he was quick to mask it by smiling warmly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello again , megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti ' s brows shot up at the familiarity of pe ##sh ' s greeting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know each other ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , ' ' megan began . [SEP]
[CLS] how was she going to explain ? [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing she needed was to get off on the wrong foot with her cow ##or ##kers . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she and i share a gods ##on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh how wonderful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti patted megan ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what luck for you then ending up here out of all the hospitals ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , what luck , ' ' megan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' ll let you two catch up for a minute or two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to do that , ' ' megan protested . [SEP]
[CLS] waving her hand dismiss ##ively , kris ##ti said , ` ` it gives me a chance to go grab a snack and something to drink . [SEP]
[CLS] be back in a few , and we ' ll finish the tour . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan fought the urge to run after kris ##ti as she walked off . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she turned back to pe ##sh who was staring expect ##antly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t exactly look happy to see me , ' ' pe ##sh said . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head wildly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how could i be ? [SEP]
[CLS] the man , who i completely made an ass out of myself in front of , is at the hospital where i ' m doing my clinical ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] that does n ' t exactly make my day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for the last time , you have nothing to be embarrassed about . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , but that does not make me feel any better , ' ' she grumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what can i do to put you at ease about working with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rubbing her now aching head , she replied , ` ` i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] if i thought it would n ' t make me look bad , i ' d request a transfer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i off ##end you that much ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] as she gazed up at him , his expression was wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no , you do n ' t off ##end me . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just that . . . ' ' she chewed mer ##ci ##lessly on her bottom lip before she continued . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking a ragged breath , she replied , ` ` it ' s just that for the past two years , i had pretty good control of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] the night i was with you , i let all that control cr ##umble . [SEP]
[CLS] by getting drunk , i became someone else - someone i used to be . [SEP]
[CLS] the girl , or woman , who would do anything to get a man ' s attention . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t like that person very much , and i do n ' t ever want to go back there . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing you just makes me remember all of that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help being surprised by how honest she ' d been able to be with him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh remained silent for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] his dark eyes bore into hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am sorry that you reflect so negatively on the night we were together . [SEP]
[CLS] for me , it was not marred by drinking or you getting sick . [SEP]
[CLS] i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i enjoyed waking up with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel bad about yourself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really enjoyed being with me that night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i told you i wanted to see you again , i was serious . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s very sweet of you , but i have n ' t changed my mind about dating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a shake of her head , she replied , ` ` i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with someone . [SEP]
[CLS] it would n ' t be fair to them . . . to you . [SEP]
[CLS] especially since we still want very different things from each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] megan noticed the sadness that darkened his expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have nothing to regret . [SEP]
[CLS] any grief i ' m experiencing is once again my fault . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a rue ##ful smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i seem to keep falling for women who are n ' t meant for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sucked in a harsh breath at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` falling ? [SEP]
[CLS] you are . . . you were falling for me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh opened his mouth to reply , but at the sound of kris ##ti coming back from the break room , he shut it . [SEP]
[CLS] closing the gap between them , he whispered , ` ` do n ' t worry about working with me , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll always be friends , and i will respect your wishes and your distance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , his words had the opposite effect they should have , and regret rico ##chet ##ed through her . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she managed to say , ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a smile , he then turned and walked away . [SEP]
[CLS] she heaved a painful breath as kris ##ti walked up to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` such a sweetheart , is n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not bad on the eyes either . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a nervous giggle escaped megan ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he ' s not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i swear that half of the women here in the er act like they ' re in heat whenever he comes around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti fan ##ned herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , that body , those eyes , and those dim ##ples . [SEP]
[CLS] lord , if i was n ' t a happily married woman , what i would n ' t want to do to that man ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan knew exactly what kris ##ti meant . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , she was never going to get the chance to experience it for herself . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow she ' d managed to find the only man left in the world who would n ' t part ##ake in just a sexual relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] no , pe ##sh had to want more than she was willing to give . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you hear what i said ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan snapped her gaze from pe ##sh ' s retreating form back to face kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no , i ' m about to lose another one to dr . nad ##een ' s charms , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] shaking her head wildly , megan replied , ` ` no , no , we ' re just friends - i do n ' t feel anything like that for him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti winked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , just keep telling yourself that , honey . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eight as pe ##sh exited one of the exam rooms , he saw megan sitting on a stool at the counter , working on a chart . [SEP]
[CLS] when the door shut behind him , she jerked her head up and caught him staring . [SEP]
[CLS] he cleared his throat and walked over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , ' ' he said , pleasantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , are you settling in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everyone has been so nice and helpful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m glad to hear that . [SEP]
[CLS] we usually have very good success rates with our clinical candidates . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled before her head dipped back down to work on the chart . [SEP]
[CLS] nervously , he scratched the back of his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] things were rolling along with them now that he knew he should n ' t try to rock the boat . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , he had promised her he would keep his distance . [SEP]
[CLS] but he could n ' t help himself . [SEP]
[CLS] in the two months since their first encounter , he had n ' t stopped thinking about her . [SEP]
[CLS] now that she had shown back up in his life so out of the blue , he could n ' t help feeling that it was fated . [SEP]
[CLS] ask her to dinner , his mind shouted . [SEP]
[CLS] he bit down on his lip to keep the question he was burning to ask from escaping his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , it rushed forth before he could stop himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you let me buy you dinner after work ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s sc ##ri ##bbling pen stilled on the chart . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up and cocked her head at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dinner implies a date , and i thought we were clear on that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a nervous smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i was only offering some less pal ##atable cafeteria food . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly think that constitutes a date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in my realm of dating consciousness , any time you sit down at a table while eating and drinking together , it is a date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , ` ` if that were true , it would mean you were dating your father and brother every time you sat down together . [SEP]
[CLS] i know your family is close , but i do n ' t believe they ' re that close . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s brows rose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , is the good doctor cracking jokes now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` perhaps . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of megan ' s lips turned up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what exactly would you consider a date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh leaned back against the wall , sur ##mis ##ing her teasing smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a mutually agreed upon event . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so proper , ' ' megan teased . [SEP]
[CLS] he rolled his eyes at her , something he rarely did until he began spending more and more time in her presence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re avoiding the initial question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan put down the pen and chart and crossed her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , if you could take me on a date , where would we go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh rubbed his jaw in thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , if would have to be something you would want to do , but i would begin with dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she started to protest , he held up his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` somewhere that was romantic with candle ##light and soft music - perhaps a place where we could dance in between courses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] staring at him in surprise , megan replied , ` ` you ' re serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she slowly shook her head back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , go on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` once we finished wine and dessert , i would then want to take you somewhere you ' ve never been - ' ' ` ` like your bedroom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan inter ##jected with a smirk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do believe you ' ve already been there before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the teasing faded from megan ' s expression , and a flush entered her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` may i continue ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would want to be with you to experience something you never have before - an art gallery , an opera , a musical . [SEP]
[CLS] anything that would bring wonder ##ment and excitement to your face . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a small smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and it would mean all the more that i was getting to share it with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he watched with almost mild amusement as she processed his words . [SEP]
[CLS] most likely she had never had a man speak to her the way he was , and it was certainly affecting her . [SEP]
[CLS] feeling like it was time to go in for the kill , he asked once again , ` ` so , will you have dinner with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh leaned forward expect ##antly as megan opened her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] they were interrupted by the sound of emma ' s voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh thank god . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so glad you two are on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her anxious tone was the only thing that could have torn pe ##sh ' s attention away from megan . [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced from emma to aidan , who was grim ##acing and rubbing his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma replied , ` ` he fell and hit his head , ' ' at the same time aidan grunted , ` ` nothing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan stepped forward and went over to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped as she surveyed him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ankle , your pupils are huge ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh took his pen ##light out of his coat pocket and went to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] as he flashed the light into aidan ' s eyes , he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , they are . [SEP]
[CLS] what exactly happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he made sure to direct his question to emma since she appeared to be the only one being honest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were at my ob ' s for our first ultrasound . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ultrasound . . . you ' re pregnant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan questioned by his side . [SEP]
[CLS] the concern for aidan on emma ' s face washed away and was replaced with a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' m eight weeks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you say something at dinner sunday ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i only found out two weeks ago , and we wanted to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s blonde brows cr ##eased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what does the ultrasound have to do with ankle hitting his head ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma pursed her lips and cut her gaze over to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like to tell them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he shook his head and then winced , emma sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when they hooked me up to the fetal monitor , they thought they heard two heartbeat ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at the word ' twins ' , aidan passed out and hit his head on the counter and the floor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] while pe ##sh quickly turned a laugh into a cough , megan was n ' t so ta ##ct ##ful . [SEP]
[CLS] she burst out laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you seriously passed out during the ultrasound ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan scowled at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in my defense , it was n ' t quite the ultrasound yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at megan ' s continued laughter , he shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was pretty mind - blowing news . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ankle , honestly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan turned to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so am i going to stand around all day getting shit , or are you going to examine me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] your pupils are definitely a matter of concern . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at emma , aidan said , ` ` just wait for me here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh motioned for aidan to go into the first examining room . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the door closed behind him , aidan lunged for him , grabbing the lap ##els of his white coat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need a vase ##ct ##omy . [SEP]
[CLS] today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh fought the urge to laugh at the absurd ##ity of the situation as well as aidan ' s desperation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , let ' s get you to sit down . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve obviously been through a lot of trauma in the last hour . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan pl ##opped onto the examining table . [SEP]
[CLS] he buried his head in his hands and groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a f * * king nightmare of a day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does your head hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any nausea ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh furrowed his brows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean , maybe ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan raised his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re asking if i ' m nausea ##ted now , the answer would be no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not . [SEP]
[CLS] but on the other hand , if you ' re asking if i get na ##use ##ous thinking about the fact that emma could have been pregnant with twins , and i would have had three kids under two and in dia ##pers . . . ' ' aidan shuddered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then yeah , i get really f * * king na ##use ##ous , and the room starts to spin a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] easing down on his stool , he rolled over to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take a deep breath for me , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s chest expanded as he inhaled and exhaled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` again , ' ' pe ##sh instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few cleansing breaths , pe ##sh cocked his head at aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` better ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , a little , ' ' aidan cr ##oa ##ked . [SEP]
[CLS] he jerked his hand through his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to get me a refer ##ral for a vase ##ct ##omy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh held up his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m confused . [SEP]
[CLS] if you know that emma is n ' t having twins , why do you want to have a vase ##ct ##omy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because twins run on both sides of our families . [SEP]
[CLS] pop was a twin , and emma ' s uncles are twins . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like we have a genetic bull ' s - eye hovering over us . [SEP]
[CLS] we can barely be in the same room without con ##ce ##iving , so it ' s just inevitable that she ' ll get pregnant again , and then i ' ll have four kids . . . maybe even five . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t be a baby making machine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , most recent studies still conclude that identical twins can happen to anyone , whereas , fra ##tern ##al twins are the result of the mother producing two eggs in a single cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] this tendency to create multiple eggs is passed from mother to child . [SEP]
[CLS] given that emma does n ' t have a non - identical twin , you are fairly safe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan tilted his head , his expression one of confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re saying i do n ' t have to worry about that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` without knowing emma ' s full genetic history , i could n ' t say , but it sounds like a no - at least for fra ##tern ##al twins . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after processing pe ##sh ' s words , aidan shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like it really matters about the twins . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re still way too fertile together . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to stop this before it gets out of hand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what does emma think about all of this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a red flush entered aidan ' s cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , i have n ' t actually mentioned it to her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t think your wife needs to know about such a life - altering decision ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , of course i ' d tell her before i went in for the surgery . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh crossed his arms over his chest , he could n ' t help wondering just how hard aidan had been hit in the head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can not seriously be sitting there saying that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan stared at pe ##sh for a moment before he groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh man , i ' m being a giant , selfish tool about this , are n ' t i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pretty much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan rubbed his hand over his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just . . . being a father is f * * king scary sometimes . [SEP]
[CLS] i worry about noah constantly , and now there ' s another baby in the mix . [SEP]
[CLS] plus , another baby means more time taken away from emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave a weak smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love her so much . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes . . . i just ca n ' t get enough of her , and i do n ' t want to share . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think that ' s a perfectly normal feeling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it makes me sound like a selfish bastard . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , who is jealous of their kid for taking their wife ' s time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a lot of men . [SEP]
[CLS] so stop beating yourself up over what you ' re feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] most of all , do n ' t bottle it up . [SEP]
[CLS] talk to emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s blue eyes widened as he shook his head furiously back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh hell no , i do n ' t want her thinking badly of me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she wo n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] emma always appreciate ##s honesty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` about me being jealous of her time with our kids ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m pretty sure she would not want me being honest about that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what has emma always said is the most important thing in a relationship ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how are you building her trust by lying to her about your feelings ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s blonde brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i should just tell her i ' m afraid of losing her and that i want us to maximize our time together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would think so . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think any woman could get angry hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan appeared thoughtful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess you ' re right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled as he patted aidan ' s shoulder reassuring ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re doing a wonderful job being a father . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure you ' ll do just as well with a second and maybe even a third child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed hard , his adam ' s apple bob ##bing up and down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind a third kid . . . just not now . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe in a couple of years . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced up and smiled at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but thanks for the vote of confidence on me being a father . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just call it as i see it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about i check on your head now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh started feeling for unusual lump ##s and bumps on aidan ' s head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , i do n ' t feel anything abnormal . [SEP]
[CLS] but just to be on the safe side , i want you to have a ct scan to rule out concussion or any brain bleed ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jesus , i could have all of that from just hitting my head ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would be surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] let me go call in the order , and they ' ll come take you back . [SEP]
[CLS] hopefully you wo n ' t have too long a wait . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re usually slower during the afternoons when the doctors ' offices and imaging centers are open . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he started for the door , aidan stopped him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , man , with all the cr ##azi ##ness , i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her placement ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh did n ' t have to think twice before responding , ` ` she is going to make an incredible nurse . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i ever doubted her abilities . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just good to hear her praises sung by a doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] popping pe ##sh on the chest teasing ##ly with his hand , aidan asked , ` ` how ' s it going between you and megan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh almost laughed out loud at aidan ' s forth ##right ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not in his nature to be so blunt , and after megan turning him down yet again , he was n ' t really sure how to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i truly respect and admire megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he considered that the most diplomatic way to answer her uncle ' s en ##qui ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] despite feeling glad that he obviously had earned his friend ' s respect , he would n ' t say anything unto ##ward about megan in front of him . [SEP]
[CLS] it is her business who she did or did n ' t date . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t imagine it was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan eyed him before saying , ` ` look i know you got off to a rocky start , but it ' s not hopeless . [SEP]
[CLS] are you planning on asking her out ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not letting this go , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope . [SEP]
[CLS] not a chance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shoved his hands into his lab coat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have asked megan to accompany me on a date , but at this point , we are at a stale ##mate . [SEP]
[CLS] but , i am not planning on giving up anytime soon . [SEP]
[CLS] does that satisfy your inquisition ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan laughed , but then his brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] you two looked pretty cozy and comfortable together when we walked up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a regret ##ful shake of his head , pe ##sh replied , ` ` she does n ' t want to date me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i call bullshit . [SEP]
[CLS] i may have been bon ##ked in the head , but no one could deny the way she was looking at you . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe if you - ' ' although it was against his character , he let his anger over ##ride his better judgment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she wants me for sex but not for a relationship , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s mouth gaped open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , she ' s acting like . . . a dude ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other honorable event that a man and woman can part ##ake in on a date , and instead , she would rather pursue a strictly physical relationship , then the answer is yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my god , it ' s like she ' s turned into the old me , ' ' aidan muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] he ran his hand over his face before he looked at pe ##sh again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , pe ##sh replied , ` ` she ' s still very young . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose in her eyes , she ' s been deprived of fun the last two years . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a way for her to make up for that . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless if we agree or understand it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i still call bullshit on the whole thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave pe ##sh a long , hard stare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to keep trying , no matter what . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t say i was giving up , did i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep trying when it feels like you are n ' t winning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what occurred with you and emma is totally different than with megan and me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you still have to try . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan hopped off the examining table and wo ##bbled for a moment on un ##stead ##y legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan has been hurt before , and i do n ' t think she really knows what it is to be loved . [SEP]
[CLS] not deeply where her needs were considered . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , she was only twenty - three when she got knocked up . [SEP]
[CLS] i want her to find someone who will cher ##ish her , man . [SEP]
[CLS] i want my girl cared for . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he patted pe ##sh ' s shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think that someone could be you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when aidan started to argue , pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` time to see about your head . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever , ' ' aidan mumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh opened the door for aidan , emma and megan stared expect ##antly at them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ' s the verdict ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think he ' s going to be just fine , but to be on the safe side , i ' ve ordered him a ct scan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s eyes widened in fear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think he has some brain injury from the fall ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked in a panic ##ky voice . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled to try and put her at ease . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think there ' s anything wrong besides a slight bump on the head , but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay then , ' ' emma replied . [SEP]
[CLS] an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to escort aidan to his scan . [SEP]
[CLS] before he sat down , aidan leaned over to kiss emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine , babe . [SEP]
[CLS] stop worrying . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t good for you or the baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a weak smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll try hard not to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he winked at her before collapsing down in the wheelchair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing can keep me down - you should know that by now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least we know the bump did n ' t do anything to your ego . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not , ' ' emma agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti poked her head out of one of the examining rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dr . nad ##een , i need you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded before turning to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you show emma to one of the family waiting rooms ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] emma reached up to hug him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks for taking care of aidan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was my pleasure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave them a final wave before disappearing into the waiting patient ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] but after talking to aidan , he definitely had a little more determined bounce in his step . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter nine two days later when megan came in for a later shift , she found the emergency room in a state of chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked kris ##ti , after she ' d clock ##ed in and put away her things . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` every month or so we seem to have a day where everything is madness from start to finish . [SEP]
[CLS] you can never anti ##ci ##pate it - you kinda just have to go with the flow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so get ready to be on your toes today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , sounds good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as they started working their way through patients , things continued to es ##cala ##te into overwhelming territory for megan . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti seemed to be experiencing the same feeling since the tops of her cheeks had a shine of per ##sp ##ira ##tion beads on them . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment they finished with one patient and di ##sin ##fect ##ed the room , another patient was waiting to enter it . [SEP]
[CLS] megan followed behind kris ##ti as she went to poke her head in to the registration area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey janet , could you not call anyone else back ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re getting swamp ##ed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] janet shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just as crazy out in the waiting room . [SEP]
[CLS] like we ' re almost over ##flow ##ing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fabulous . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s probably another full moon , which makes things absolutely insane . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned back to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` listen , since we ' re so swamp ##ed , can you take the man in exam b ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help her eyes from widening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] on my own ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti smiled before patting megan ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve seen you in action the last week . [SEP]
[CLS] i have faith in you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , if you ' re sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m positive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t contain her smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking her ipad , she flipped open the registration details on the patient awaiting her . [SEP]
[CLS] when she pushed open the door , she eyed the man on the examining table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good evening mr . robertson , i ' m megan . [SEP]
[CLS] what - ' ' before she could even get out the standard ` ` what seems to be the problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] question , the man started shaking his head furiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t let you examine me . [SEP]
[CLS] i want a doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] a male doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] you understand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir , i understand , but i have to follow protocol , which is to as ##cer ##tain your issues before the doctor comes in . [SEP]
[CLS] i see on the chart that you ' re experiencing some abdominal swelling ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he refused to meet her eye . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he gazed over at the wall before holding up one finger to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i meant what i said . [SEP]
[CLS] i demand to see a male doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , but we ' re very backed up this afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor , least of all a male doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when it appeared the man ' s resolve was fading a little , megan took a tentative step forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , if you would just let me take a look at your abdomen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is n ' t my stomach , ' ' he mumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he did n ' t respond , she sighed with frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mr . robertson , you can not ignore abdominal swelling . [SEP]
[CLS] it can stem from many issues and have many rep ##er ##cus ##sions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shifted uncomfortably on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] just when she thought she was making head ##way with him , he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get me a male doctor ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] the first time she had the chance to see a patient on her own , and he had to be a stark ravi ##ng lunatic . [SEP]
[CLS] refusing to give into him or accept defeat , she stalked over to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was going to exam his sex ##ist ass if it was the last thing she did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` keep screaming , and i ' ll call security , ' ' she warned before snatch ##ing the sheet off him . [SEP]
[CLS] his screams cut off to a shriek as he clawed for the sheet , but the damage was done . [SEP]
[CLS] she had seen more than enough . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] my . [SEP]
[CLS] god , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] she gazed wide - eyed and open - mouthed at what had to be the poster child picture to go along with the warning labels on via ##gra and cia ##lis for four - hour erection ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s going to have to be as ##pi ##rated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] she cocked her head at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the excessive blood in your penis ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not just going to go away on its own . [SEP]
[CLS] it has to be as ##pi ##rated , which means drained out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like with a needle ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , with a very large needle . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to protest , she brought her hand up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lucky for you , i can not do the procedure - it is to be handled strictly by a doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a male ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if it came to your penis exploding from the pressure by waiting for a male doctor , would you seriously be that pick ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his blue eyes widened in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i thought so . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she whirled out of the room , she ran right into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` doing some patient evaluation ##s on your own ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s wonderful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , yes and no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows knit ##ted in concern . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t imagine telling pe ##sh about mr . robertson ' s condition . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing she was going to do was refer the case to him . [SEP]
[CLS] draining an eng ##org ##ed penis should be left to the intern ##s , not an attending physician . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it ' s nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just a little demanding . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment , the door to the exam room flew open . [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson stood hunched over , his legs an almost painful distance apart . [SEP]
[CLS] he took one look at pe ##sh and his white coat , and he lunged at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` help me . [SEP]
[CLS] please ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although it was strictly against the nursing code , she would have loved nothing more than to have throttle ##d mr . robertson right then and there . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh grasped mr . robertson ' s hands on his coat and pulled them down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir , you need to get back inside . [SEP]
[CLS] as un ##stead ##y as you are , you certainly do not need to be on your feet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh led mr . robertson back to the examining table , megan reluctantly followed them inside the room and closed the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what seems to be the problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson glanced from pe ##sh to megan and then back to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sheep ##ish expression , he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , i seem to be having some lower abdominal swelling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan had to fight from rolling her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped between pe ##sh and mr . robertson and looked pe ##sh full on in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` while the patient refuses to acknowledge his condition , it appears after examination that he has an extreme pri ##ap ##ism . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the word , color flooded into pe ##sh ' s tan cheeks , and he broke eye contact to momentarily stare down at the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] his reaction was exactly what megan had feared she would experience in the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she had hardly imagined his level of professional ##ism would allow him to be embarrassed about a medical condition . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , their past interactions made anything of the sexual kind a little more mort ##ifying than if she was dealing with one of the male intern ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it took pe ##sh only a few seconds to recover , and then he immediately turned his attention to mr . robertson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you take any erect ##ile dysfunction medication in the last four to six hours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when mr . robertson started to look at megan , pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my nurse will stay with me through the duration of your care . [SEP]
[CLS] so i will repeat once again , did you take any medication ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cia ##lis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many mill ##ig ##ram ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when mr . robertson shrugged , pe ##sh demanded , ` ` are you being purpose ##fully eva ##sive , or do you not know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] i got it off a buddy of mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you normally take medication that is n ' t prescribed to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just wanted to try it out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh glanced over at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to ask for a full blood work - up . [SEP]
[CLS] who knows what else he might ' ve taken . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded and punched in the code on the electronic chart to get a member of the ph ##le ##bot ##omy team up to draw the blood . [SEP]
[CLS] after going over to the di ##sp ##ense ##r , pe ##sh slid a pair of rubber gloves on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to have to examine you now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a resigned huff , mr . robertson threw the sheet back . [SEP]
[CLS] megan bit down on her lip to keep from laughing at the expression on pe ##sh ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] she was pretty sure he had n ' t had to deal with a lot of penis ##es that resembled enormous egg ##pl ##ants in his career . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , her amusement quickly faded when she realized how awkward it was being in the room with him while he held another man ' s penis in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried busy ##ing herself with the electronic chart in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to do anything but look at the scene un ##folding before her . [SEP]
[CLS] once pe ##sh finished that part of the exam , mr . robertson eased back down on the examining table , and pe ##sh once again eyed the egg ##pl ##ant - colored penis . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` precisely how long have you had the erection ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` five and a half hours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there does n ' t appear to be any artery ru ##pt ##ure , so we wo n ' t need to perform surgery . [SEP]
[CLS] i think the quick ##est form of treatment , as well as the least invasive , would be to try an injection to narrow the veins and reduce the blood flow to your penis . [SEP]
[CLS] that should reduce the swelling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson ' s eyes narrowed suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and where do you have to give me the shot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in the penis , of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a gulp , mr . robertson replied , ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you grab a sy ##ring ##e of alpha - ago ##nist please ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she gladly retreated from the room to head to the medicine closet . [SEP]
[CLS] after checking the sy ##ring ##e dos ##age , she reluctantly returned to mr . robertson ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' pe ##sh said , as he took the medication from her . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched with mild disgust , as well as fascination , as he took mr . robertson ' s penis in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take a deep breath , ' ' he instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment the needle prick ##ed the skin , mr . robertson howled un ##con ##tro ##lla ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help rolling her eyes at what a complete pan ##sy he was being about the pain . [SEP]
[CLS] once pe ##sh finished , he dropped the empty sy ##ring ##e in the bio ##ha ##zard container and then glanced back at mr . robertson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if the swelling has n ' t begun to di ##ssi ##pate in the next ten to fifteen minutes , we ' re going to have to take another course of action . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson questioned , with a grimace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as ##pi ##rating the penis of the blood . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson pale ##d considerably . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , she mentioned that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said the word she like megan was a swarm of locus ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh turned to smile at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then she made a good call . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he then eyed his page ##r that was going off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` keep an eye on him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be back in fifteen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] time ticked by ago ##ni ##zing ##ly slow as she worked on charts and kept an eye on mr . robertson . [SEP]
[CLS] every few minutes , he was lifting up the sheet to eye his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] each time he grimaced , megan imagined that the shot was n ' t working and the swelling had n ' t gone down . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh entered the room again , he glanced from her to mr . robertson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how are we doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no change . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he went over to a drawer and searched through it before producing a very large sy ##ring ##e with a very thick needle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , mr . robertson , but it looks like this is our only choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson seemed speechless for the first time all night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ms . mckenzie , can i get you to assist me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need you to help restrain him . [SEP]
[CLS] i need him to be as still as possible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan fought the urge to roll her eyes at his suggestion . [SEP]
[CLS] mr . robertson had to out ##weig ##h her by a hundred pounds , not to mention that when pain got your adrenaline pumping , you were even stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did as she was told . [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh brought the needle to mr . robertson ' s penis , she gripped her hands tight into his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] when the needle pierced the skin , it took everything within her to keep him on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] grit ##ting her teeth , she held her ground . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , when the last of the blood had been withdrawn , she was able to loosen her grip . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh tossed the sy ##ring ##e into the bio ##ha ##zard container and then turned around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i advise you take some ib ##up ##ro ##fen for both the pain and for the anti - inflammatory benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] i would also do a round or two of using an ice pack on your crotch . [SEP]
[CLS] it would be my strongest advice that you never take anymore erect ##ile dysfunction medication until you actually need it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever , ' ' mr . robertson cr ##oa ##ked , collapsing back onto the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give him about thirty minutes , and then he needs to head on home . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll need the exam room , ' ' pe ##sh instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a quick smile before exiting the room . [SEP]
[CLS] after thirty minutes , she saw mr . robertson to the door of the er . [SEP]
[CLS] as he staggered into the waiting room , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , ' ' kris ##ti called . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ahead and take your dinner break now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i can work through it since we ' re so busy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re fine . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , you ' re going to need all your strength . [SEP]
[CLS] things are probably going to get even cr ##azi ##er after the sun goes down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan tried not to appear horrified at the prospect . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she ducked into the break room to grab her purse . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came out , pe ##sh was waiting for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are you going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it ' s my dinner break . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh gave an imp ##ish smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how fortunate . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s mine as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] realizing what he was intending , she slowly shook her head back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no dates . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after crossing his arms over his chest , pe ##sh asked , ` ` and how would it be a date if we happened to go to the cafeteria at the same time and sit at the same table ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pushing it , and you know it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after what we both just endured , how can you deny me the pleasure of buying your dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a teasing twinkle flashed in his dark eyes - one she was n ' t used to seeing on him . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , she found it completely irresistible . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , how can i possibly have romance on my mind when i just held another man ' s penis in my hands ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened in shock at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` d - did you actually just say that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i believe i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you sometimes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t try to pin me as one thing or the other . [SEP]
[CLS] just take me as i am , ' ' pe ##sh suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll try . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as they started to the elevator , megan chewed her lip with unease . [SEP]
[CLS] turning to pe ##sh she asked , ` ` what will people say if they see the two of us together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that we ' re two single people having dinner , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a physician , and i ' m a clinical student . [SEP]
[CLS] could n ' t i get in trouble ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` doctors and nurses often have dinner together on their breaks . [SEP]
[CLS] the cafeteria is a pretty inc ##ons ##pic ##uous place for us to be alone together . [SEP]
[CLS] if someone came upon us in one of the medicine rooms or an empty patient room , then we might have a problem . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you say so , ' ' she mumbled , as he punched the down button on the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] after they stepped on the car , pe ##sh eyed her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really are worried , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my career means everything to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to do anything to je ##opa ##rdi ##ze it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i ' ll make sure we do n ' t sit by ourselves . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i really appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the car started its decent down , pe ##sh threw his head back and exhaled a long breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that was . . . ' ' megan grinned at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the good doctor seems speechless . [SEP]
[CLS] surely in all your years in the er , you ' ve seen cr ##azi ##er or more mort ##ifying cases . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cocked his head , appearing thoughtful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a screw ##drive ##r lodged in a rec ##tum is probably the tame ##st . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the tame ##st ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan questioned inc ##red ##ulously , as the elevator door ding ##ed open . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a man high on met ##h walking into the er with his penis in his hand is probably the cr ##azi ##est . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s hand swept over her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he actually cut off his . . . ' ' she gazed around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is the good nurse speechless ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we got him se ##date ##d and into surgery as soon as we could . [SEP]
[CLS] i heard they were able to se ##w it back on . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not aware of whether or not it was ever . . . fully functional again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is crazy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh handed her a food tray . [SEP]
[CLS] as they sur ##mise ##d their choices , megan asked , ` ` was that your standard line of questioning in a situation like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we ' ve established that i have n ' t been privy to many pri ##ap ##ism cases , but yes , any time there is an issue with the penis that is not related to the ur ##eth ##ra or bladder , you would ask those questions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after the food service worker gave them both an odd look , pe ##sh looked pointedly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do you ask ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just to be prepared for the next time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cocked his brows at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want to practice your line of questioning ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know , show me what you ' ve learned ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get our food first , shall we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after deciding that the grille ##d chicken salad was about the most appealing item in the food line , she grabbed a drink and some of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . [SEP]
[CLS] just as she inched up to pay , pe ##sh put his tray next to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] he had chosen some kind of stir - fry that did n ' t look app ##eti ##zing to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] when she dug in her purse for her wallet , he handed a twenty to the cash ##ier . [SEP]
[CLS] as he took his change , she shot him a look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you buying my dinner does n ' t look very innocent , ' ' she hissed , as they started toward the tables . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i highly doubt she ' s keeping the gossip mill going on how dr . nad ##een bought the lovely new clinical student a salad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you never know , ' ' megan countered . [SEP]
[CLS] trailing pe ##sh , she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses . [SEP]
[CLS] while the bottom half was filled with people , the top was practically empty . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mind if we take these seats ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go right ahead , nad ##een , ' ' a bush ##y haired doctor replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re expecting a few more to join us , ' ' he said , before covert ##ly wink ##ing at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you play a good game , ' ' she said , softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d just finished dr ##iz ##z ##ling dressing over her salad when pe ##sh said , ` ` ready to prove yourself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are we really going to talk about this while we eat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll learn that most lunch ##es and dinners are spent either reviewing cases or getting input on cases . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] putting on a professional air , she asked , ` ` have you taken any erect ##ile dysfunction medication ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after swallowing a bite of stir - fry , he replied , ` ` no , never . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have trouble obtaining an erection ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the twinkle returned to his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would think you would n ' t need to ask that question after our previous encounter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a shiver went down her spine as she remembered her core rubbing against the hardened ridge in his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` considering it is unlikely that i would have any previous knowledge of the patient , just answer the question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a sly smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , never . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have trouble maintaining an erection ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could once again point out that you had personal knowledge of how well i was able to maintain myself once aroused , but i ' ll refrain . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , i ' ll say no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ha , ha , nice way to get your point in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had to try . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cocked her head at him , giving him a teasing smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if a patient was trying to flirt as much as you are during my questioning , then i would have to remind him that i am a professional . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . [SEP]
[CLS] then forgive me for trying to undermine your professional ##ism . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re forgiven . . . for now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a long sw ##ig of his iced tea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did really well back there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you did . [SEP]
[CLS] for that to be your first case on your own , you managed to keep yourself together and to give the patient the best level of diagnosis and care you could . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help the warmth rushing to her cheeks that his compliment ##s caused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i appreciate your confidence . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re going to make an amazing nurse . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that there will be many hospitals v ##ying to hire you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know about that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t under ##est ##imate your talents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think they would want to hire me here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would n ' t mind a permanent placement here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it has n ' t been long , but i have been happy here . [SEP]
[CLS] i like the people i work with . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i would n ' t want to go into the unknown when i know what i have here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he swallowed a bite of his rice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s understand ##able . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after wiping his mouth , he smiled at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think they would be crazy not to make you an offer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] leaning in over his plate , he held her gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] the intensity in which he stared at her caused her to shudder . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the hospital cafeteria . [SEP]
[CLS] a mixture of emotions course ##d through her - warmth , safety , lust , happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t experienced that range of feelings with a man in a long , long time . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he spoke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know it would make me very happy to have you here , and i would do everything within my power to ensure you stayed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she could reply , a tray smacked down onto the table next to her . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the residents , a young male named dr . morris , grinned at the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , i hear you two just handled a pri ##ap ##ism case . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , we did , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t dare look back at pe ##sh to gage his expression on being interrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] dr . morris groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh come on . [SEP]
[CLS] give me the juicy details . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t gotten to see one of those yet . [SEP]
[CLS] the best groin swelling i ' ve had is when some idiot tried to pierce his balls , and they got infected . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when megan wrinkled her nose , pe ##sh ' s laughter surprised her . [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze flew to him , and he winked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you that the conversations we had over dinner were not exactly app ##eti ##zing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m starting to believe you , ' ' she replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow she managed to dev ##our the rest of her salad while pe ##sh told dr . morris the ins and outs of the case . [SEP]
[CLS] after she finished , she rose out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i better head back . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , with everything being so crazy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] surprisingly , pe ##sh did n ' t get up nor did he offer to walk her back . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she saw an acceptance on his face that told her he was letting her go so there would be no suspicion raised about the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for dinner , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] his smiles were starting to do something to her that she did n ' t like . [SEP]
[CLS] they were no longer ign ##iting her panties on fire ; instead , they were making her long to spend time with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and strode out of the cafeteria . [SEP]
[CLS] with the chaos surrounding her , she thankfully put pe ##sh out of her mind for the rest of the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter ten after two exhaust ##ing weeks in her clinical ##s , megan was ready for a little rand ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] so she was thrilled when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a girl ' s day . [SEP]
[CLS] she was even more stoke ##d when emma said that aidan was willing to keep mason , so he and noah could play together . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she was sure her parents would have watched him , she hated imposing on them so much . [SEP]
[CLS] an hour after the call , she was pulling into aidan and emma ' s driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] when she opened the backseat to get mason out , he was already bop ##ping up and down in his car seat with excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved aidan and emma ' s house , and he especially loved playing with noah , even though they were eleven months apart . [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed him and his dia ##per bag and then made her way up the front walk . [SEP]
[CLS] emma answered the door with noah on her hip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , i ' m so excited you could make it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should know by now i have no life except for mason and work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel the same way sometimes , ' ' emma replied , as megan stepped through the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] as she walked through the foyer and down the hall to the kitchen , mason sq ##ui ##rmed to get down . [SEP]
[CLS] once she set him on his feet , he ran into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s where aidan was lou ##nging on the couch with beau on the floor next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` beau ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason cried . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned in to hug the massive lab . [SEP]
[CLS] megan never had to worry about beau and mason ; he was truly a gentle giant when it came to infants and kids . [SEP]
[CLS] beau thumped his tail heart ##ily at the attention . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan glanced up from the tv and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned as she reached down to kiss his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] and you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great . [SEP]
[CLS] looking forward to having a man ' s day with the boys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , with two kids under two , let ' s see how much fun you ' ll have . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s good practice for me when the new baby gets here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` baby or babies ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] with his eyes widening , he quickly replied , ` ` baby singular . [SEP]
[CLS] that was confirmed , thank god . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing her head , she teasing ##ly asked , ` ` and when is the ultrasound to confirm the youngest fitzgerald granddaughter is on her way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan huffed exasperated ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not for a few more months , smart - ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she brought her hand to her chest in mock outrage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was just a question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah and considering you ' ve had a kid yourself , i ' m sure you know all too well at what month the gender ultrasound is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just think it ' s cool that i ' ll be the oldest granddaughter , and she ' ll be the youngest . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a pained expression , aidan groaned , ` ` whatever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ru ##ffled his still un ##ke ##mpt bed hair playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , ankle . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to be an amazing father to that little girl . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' ll undoubtedly have you wrapped around her finger before she ' s even out of the womb . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a man like me , or i guess i should say , a man like i used to be , does not want to bring forth daughters into the world . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pay ##back is a bitch , ' ' she mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t i know it , ' ' he grumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] emma came into the living room then . [SEP]
[CLS] she handed noah to aidan along with a bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you sure you ' ll be all right today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be fine - we ' ll be fine . [SEP]
[CLS] wo n ' t we mason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason glanced up from lumber ##ing around the room on beau ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see . [SEP]
[CLS] stop worrying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave emma a very pointed look before adding , ` ` a promise is a promise after all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she flushed a little at his words , but then gave him a shy smile . [SEP]
[CLS] when he winked playfully at her , megan could n ' t help feeling her chest tighten at the exchange . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing her once man - whore uncle now a loving , devoted husband and father was always surprisingly un ##ner ##ving . [SEP]
[CLS] but deep down , it was how much she truly wanted what aidan and emma had . [SEP]
[CLS] love , companions ##hip , and devotion within marriage while having someone else to parent with you . [SEP]
[CLS] if you were n ' t so stubborn you could probably have something just like aidan and emma have with pe ##sh ! [SEP]
[CLS] but no , you have to keep believing that you ' re too young to get married . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re probably throwing away happiness with both hands just because you ' re afraid . [SEP]
[CLS] emma brought her out of her self - de ##pre ##cating ti ##rade . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what should we do first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , as they walked into the garage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nails and toes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , that sounds good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they both slid into emma ' s suv . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan buckled up , emma turned to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you do n ' t mind that casey is meeting us for lunch ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not . [SEP]
[CLS] the more the mer ##rier . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , casey is a ho ##ot . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma smiled and crank ##ed up the car . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that she is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before long , they were pulling into starbucks to grab some coffee for megan and tea for emma . [SEP]
[CLS] then they walked around the corner to the nail salon . [SEP]
[CLS] after relaxing mani ##cure ##s and pe ##dic ##ures , they drove about twenty minutes to meet casey at their favorite little local restaurant that was housed in an old train depot . [SEP]
[CLS] as they walked up , they saw casey sitting outside in the sunshine text ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey girl ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma called . [SEP]
[CLS] casey waved to them before rising off the bench . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , hello . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a round of hugs was exchanged between the three women . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you two would never get here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m starving . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] they were a little behind at the nail salon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they pushed through the front door and were quickly seated by the hostess who knew them well . [SEP]
[CLS] once they eased into a familiar , comfortable booth , they took stock of the menu ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to order alcohol on our behalf since we ' re both two knocked - up ladies now , ' ' casey insisted . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know you were pregnant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , nate finally wore me down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she then shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sometimes i think he ' s the chick in this relationship . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he must ' ve done some heavy convincing , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] with a nod , casey replied , ` ` he comes from such a large immediate and extended family that he ' s been it ##ching to have a child . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve been married a year and together eight , so i guess it was just time . [SEP]
[CLS] and while i was n ' t thrilled with the idea of having a baby when his internship was so crazy , his hours will be better by the time the baby gets here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when are you due ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` around the same time as emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that statement made emma beam . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our babies are going to be best friends , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i just know it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey grinned at the sentiment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or boyfriend and girlfriend . . . ' ' ` ` that ' s a thought . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma jerked her chin up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure i want your son corrupt ##ing my little girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with her dark eyes widening , casey huffed , ` ` and what if it ' s my daughter that your son is corrupt ##ing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if my son takes after his father , then that would be the case . [SEP]
[CLS] but i think we also have to consider that if your daughter is anything like you , she ' ll be the one doing the corrupt ##ing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess i should keep mason clear of her too , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably , ' ' emma replied . [SEP]
[CLS] after the waitress appeared to take their drink and food orders , casey pinned megan with an intense stare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , ' ' she began , qui ##rkin ##g her brow at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear your doing your clinical ##s under dr . mc ##dre ##amy bollywood . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help but laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you mean i ' m doing them under dr . nad ##een , then the answer is yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma ni ##bbled on her bottom lip before speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have things been awkward considering what happened the night of noah ' s baptism ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before megan could reply , casey ' s eyes bulge ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , whoa . [SEP]
[CLS] hold the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] something happened between you two ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan felt heat rising in her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost too mort ##ifying to repeat , but finally , she filled casey in on each and every embarrassing detail that had happened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` man , he ' s so freak ##in ' honorable , is n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he is , ' ' megan replied , g ##lum ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] emma shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s nothing wrong with his honor . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s what attracted me to him in the first place . [SEP]
[CLS] there are so few gentlemen left on the planet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she could stop herself , megan blurted , ` ` but i did n ' t want a gentleman . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to get laid . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t we all ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just when i think your pregnancy hormones have n ' t made you even more sex crazed , you go and say something like that , ' ' she grumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] megan t ##wi ##rled the straw in her diet coke thoughtfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s bizarre is even though he should have been completely and totally turned off by what happened that night , he ' s still interested in me . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , the man is gorgeous and has half of the women in the hospital panting over him , and he still wants me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what ' s the problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s interested in dating , not sex . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but would n ' t you have sex eventually if you were dating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re at a stale ##mate - i just want straight sex without dinner and a movie , and to quote him , he wants to show me a whole new world through a date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ala ##ddin of him , ' ' casey qui ##pped to which emma shot her an exasperated look . [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , megan replied , ` ` basically we ' re going to stay forever in the friend zone because neither one of us is willing to give in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would it really kill you to go out with the guy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan widened her eyes in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , you of all people are actually advocating me giving in to him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked her thumb over at emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d expect that out of her but not you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey da ##bbed the corners of her lips with her napkin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just a date . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think he ' s going to drug you and drag you to a wedding chapel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d certainly hope not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ' s wrong with having an innocent dinner and maybe a movie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because that ' s not fair to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d just be leading him on , and i think we can all agree that he does n ' t need that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly , ' ' emma agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing her head , casey eyed megan thoughtfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` deep down , you like him , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i do . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone likes him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you really like him . [SEP]
[CLS] you find yourself thinking about him more than you should . [SEP]
[CLS] and you ' re kinda wishing you were n ' t such a stubborn ass about dating him . [SEP]
[CLS] because even though you ' d kill to know how well he uses his wang , you ' re even more intrigued about what being loved by him would be like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dumb ##founded , megan could only stare at casey . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d certainly hit the nail on the head about her feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , it ' s a no - win situation . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a nursing student . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t get involved with a physician . [SEP]
[CLS] it just would n ' t look good on my record . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s just one of the many reasons it would n ' t work between us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you just keep telling yourself that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we talk about something else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who ' s up for a movie after we hit the mall ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan chewed her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i do n ' t know if i should be gone that long . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to take advantage of ankle ' s kindness for watching mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he wo n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s happy to do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan raised her brows skeptical ##ly , casey snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` le ##m me guess , you bribe ##d him sexually to get him to give up a perfectly good saturday watching two kids who are under two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a red flush entered emma ' s cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know what you ' re talking about . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh em , you are so busted ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] leaning forward , she put her elbows on the table and stared straight at emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what was it ? [SEP]
[CLS] green linger ##ie ? [SEP]
[CLS] a blow job ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe a b * * w j * b while wearing green linger ##ie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] refusing to meet casey ' s in ##qui ##sit ##ive gaze , emma finally murmured , ` ` it was a b * * w j * b in the shower this morning , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey s ##nick ##ered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i knew you had done something . [SEP]
[CLS] hmm , that was fun . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like solving a sexual game of clue - it was emma in the shower with a blow job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan brought her hands up to cover her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` umm , hello ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s my uncle you ' re talking about . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll refrain from making any more comments about aidan and emma ' s sex life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' megan and emma replied in unison . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shopping and a movie then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] megan reluctantly agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll just blame you two if ankle gets all piss ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] casey winked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just blame emma . [SEP]
[CLS] then he can take it out on her later . . . in the bedroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i seriously hate you , ' ' emma grumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , the food arrived then and all sex - based conversation was forgotten . [SEP]
[CLS] at least for the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eleven brushing his hand across his sweaty brow , pe ##sh leaned back against the glass door of the trauma area . [SEP]
[CLS] as the adrenaline began de ##ple ##ting from his system , he needed to prop against something hard for support . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of how physically drained he felt , he was emotionally on cloud nine . [SEP]
[CLS] a beaming smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the gurney . [SEP]
[CLS] on it , a young woman was getting acquainted with her newborn son . [SEP]
[CLS] she had been brought in just twenty minutes before after a car accident sent her into early labor . [SEP]
[CLS] the para ##med ##ics had gotten her through the rough ##est patches , but thankfully , they had made it to the hospital in time . [SEP]
[CLS] because her labor was so advanced , they had n ' t risked getting her up to the labor and delivery floor . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , they ' d wheeled her in , and pe ##sh had gone to work . [SEP]
[CLS] it really was an amazing moment considering he ' d only delivered three other babies in the history of his medical career . [SEP]
[CLS] each one was an experience he treasure ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman glanced up at him and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you so much , dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re very welcome . [SEP]
[CLS] they will be taking you up to maternity in just a few minutes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he stepped out of the room , he found himself ambushed by kara , one of the shift nurses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey there . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s the good doctor doing today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the way she spoke was more of a pu ##rr , which was a pretty apt sum ##mation since she basically acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around . [SEP]
[CLS] he cringed as she ran her hand up his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s fine , thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned politely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m better now that i ' ve seen you , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , well , i need to go see about my next case . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her heavily painted lips turned down in a po ##ut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are n ' t you ever going to want to get a drink again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] inwardly , he groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] in a moment of weakness when he was still reeling after what had happened with megan , he had allowed her to talk him into getting a drink after work . [SEP]
[CLS] once turned into several times , and then he did the un ##thi ##nka ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] he had made out with her in his car under the faded lights of the bar ' s neon sign . [SEP]
[CLS] well , making out did n ' t quite sum up the fact that she had given him a blow job . [SEP]
[CLS] although he had vowed to never let anything like that happen again , he found himself walking a fine line around her whenever they were at work . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe . [SEP]
[CLS] things have been really busy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope that you ' ll free up some time . [SEP]
[CLS] i really , really need a night out with you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] reaching around him , kara did the un ##thi ##nka ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] she squeezed one of his ass cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] a gasp of shock behind him caused him to w ##hir ##l around . [SEP]
[CLS] of all the people in the world that could have been standing there , it had to be megan . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh quickly jerked out from kara ' s reach . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes bulge ##d at the two of them before she quickly looked away . [SEP]
[CLS] with her head ducked , she started past them . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing in the world he needed was for something to be awkward between them . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word to kara , pe ##sh turned and fell in step beside megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] just walking with you . [SEP]
[CLS] is that a problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing over her shoulder at kara , megan said , ` ` it looked like you were a little busy back there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a grimace , he said , ` ` the conversation and the contact were unwanted by me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan stared up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why am i not surprised by that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he eyed her curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are not the type of man who does public displays of affection . . . or i should say lust . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have n ' t we already established that you should n ' t try to type ##cast me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t fit into any of the pre ##con ##ce ##ive ##d holes you have tried to put me in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there is one hole that you remain firmly lodged in , and that is being a gentleman when it comes to women and sex . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as much as he hated to admit it , she had a point about him being a gentleman . [SEP]
[CLS] he touched her arm , urging her to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am a gentleman both in public and private . [SEP]
[CLS] but let me address part of your assumption . [SEP]
[CLS] when i am committed to a woman and she is committed to me , there is never a time i would reject public displays of affection or lust . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s lips curved up in a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what you ' re saying is you would actually grab your girlfriend ' s ass in public ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i would . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing around , he found them happily out of anyone ' s ears ##hot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i am truly committed to a woman , i have trouble keeping my hands off her regardless of where we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s good to know , ' ' she replied , with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help the silly grin that filled his face as she hurried down the hall to join up with kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] he was making progress with her , was n ' t he ? [SEP]
[CLS] surely megan had to be seeing how much she enjoyed spending time with him in the hospital and would soon decide that she wanted more . [SEP]
[CLS] his smile started to fade as he wondered if he was del ##uding himself . [SEP]
[CLS] with a resigned sigh , he made his way over to the reception bay to sign off on some charts . [SEP]
[CLS] he eased down on a stool and immersed himself in the paperwork , so he did n ' t have to think about megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a voice across the room shouted . [SEP]
[CLS] he snapped his head up . [SEP]
[CLS] without even looking over his shoulder , pe ##sh knew who the voice belonged to . [SEP]
[CLS] few people in his life addressed him by his full name , and no one in the hospital ever called him by his first name . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , he rose off his stool and turned around . [SEP]
[CLS] his youngest brother , dev , stalked toward him with a stormy expression plastered on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] as the oldest of his three siblings , he had always felt a responsibility to look out for his two brothers and sister . [SEP]
[CLS] while ar ##jan and sh ##vet ##a had never given him any trouble , dev , as the spoiled baby of the family , had been a challenge for both pe ##sh and his parents . [SEP]
[CLS] after experiencing teenage rebellion and a way ##ward early adult life , he had managed to get his wild ways under control when he was twenty - five . [SEP]
[CLS] dev had set his sights on a beautiful nurse pe ##sh had befriended when he was still a resident . [SEP]
[CLS] mia martin ##elli had been through hell with an abusive boyfriend , so pe ##sh was reluctant to pair the two together . [SEP]
[CLS] but at dev ' s continued insistence , pe ##sh fixed the two of them up . [SEP]
[CLS] what followed was a three - year courtship and then engagement . [SEP]
[CLS] mia was accepted and loved by all of pe ##sh ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] and then dev had gone and thrown it all away by cheating on mia . [SEP]
[CLS] in her heartbreak , mia had stayed close to pe ##sh , and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother ' s visit , but ever since he had been summoned to console mia a few days before , he had been anticipating it . [SEP]
[CLS] truth ##fully , he had been bracing himself for his brother ' s wrath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello dev , ' ' he said , in a calm voice . [SEP]
[CLS] shaking his head furiously , dev said , ` ` i just got a f * * king blow off text from mia . [SEP]
[CLS] when i tried calling her back to demand she explain herself , she could n ' t talk because she was in mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] with aj . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' m aware of that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev ' s dark eyes narrowed at pe ##sh ' s confirmation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so it ' s true that you went to talk to her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he threw up his hands in frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t want to believe anything mia said , especially that it was you who helped her see that she should n ' t give me a second chance and take me back - that she should make things work with aj . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s all true . [SEP]
[CLS] you and i both know mia would never lie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but how could you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev demanded , in a strangled voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , but i had to do what was best for mia . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev ' s brows shot up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what about me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m your f * * king blood . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , pe ##sh replied , ` ` i ' m sorry , my brother , but blood or not , i could n ' t stand by and let you hurt her again - she ' s been through too much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love her ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev shouted , which caused several of the nurses to spin around in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is not the time nor the place to be having this discussion , ' ' pe ##sh growled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not going anywhere , so you better start explaining yourself before i really start a scene . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you want the truth ? [SEP]
[CLS] here is it . [SEP]
[CLS] you only think you love mia . [SEP]
[CLS] you and i both know you can not be faithful to a woman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could have for mia . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you already failed her once . [SEP]
[CLS] she deserved better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev narrowed his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what , are you f * * king her now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grimaced at his brother ' s choice of harsh words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i ' m not . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s never been anything amor ##ous between mia and myself . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she ' s back with the man she loves - the father of her un ##born child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i need her , ' ' dev insisted , his voice taking on a plain ##tive tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , but i think it ' s best if you moved on . [SEP]
[CLS] most of all , baby brother , i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and mat ##uring before you even think about getting in another relationship . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you . . . you f * * king bastard ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shouted . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh was debating calling security to remove his un ##ru ##ly brother when he was knocked off his stool by dev ' s right hook to his jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] he tumbled backward and crashed onto the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] before dev could do something like kick him when he was down , megan appeared and wedge ##d herself between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you better leave before i call security , ' ' she demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh struggled to his feet as megan came into dev ' s line of fire . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t bear if dev hurt her in his anger just because she had taken up for him . [SEP]
[CLS] dev stared down at megan with a smirk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so my brother needs some pin ##t - sized pu * * y defending him now ? [SEP]
[CLS] word to the wise , sweetheart , do n ' t waste your time on him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s only got a bone ##r for his dead wife . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a deep growl erupted in pe ##sh ' s throat as he lunged for his brother . [SEP]
[CLS] but he never made it . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , megan ' s fist cracked into dev ' s jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] the impact did n ' t take him off his feet , but he did st ##agger backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] even as she fl ##ailed her wrist back and forth from the obvious pain , megan still managed to bell ##ow , ` ` get the hell out of here . [SEP]
[CLS] now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev stared at her in shock as he rubbed his jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` crazy bitch , ' ' he muttered , before stalking off . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan turned to him , her glow ##ering expression faded to one of concern . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re bleeding ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried , rushing for him . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand came up to grip his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] surprise flooded him when he felt wet ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] dev must ' ve hit him harder than he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid his jaw back and forth , causing him to grimace at the popping sound . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come here , ' ' megan said , grabbing his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] she started leading him over to one of the examining rooms , but he jerked back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t need all this fuss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] resigned ##ly , he followed her into the room . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time in a long time , he found himself on the opposite line of care . [SEP]
[CLS] he eased down onto the examining table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , megan , this is n ' t necessary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she bus ##ied herself taking out ga ##uze , cotton balls , and anti ##se ##ptic , she replied , ` ` quit your bitch ##in ' . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced over her shoulder at him . [SEP]
[CLS] at what must have been his inc ##red ##ulous expression at her word choice , she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] just shut up and let me take care of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you put it like that , how can i not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] her laughter warmed his heart . [SEP]
[CLS] deep down , he was pleased to find her so at ##ten ##tive to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she obviously really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up . [SEP]
[CLS] or was she just at ##ten ##tive because she was a great nurse ? [SEP]
[CLS] but then there was the fact she punched dev for insulting him . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , that was also mort ##ifying . [SEP]
[CLS] did that mean she questioned his man ##hood since he did n ' t go toe - to - toe with his brother ? [SEP]
[CLS] god , what she must think of him now . [SEP]
[CLS] as he allowed megan to treat his cuts , his thoughts turned to dev ' s last verbal punch . [SEP]
[CLS] he grimaced about dev ' s all ##uding to the fact he was in love with a ghost . [SEP]
[CLS] was that what stopped megan from believing his attraction to her ? [SEP]
[CLS] was she really hiding her commitment ph ##ob ##ia behind a belief that he was still completely in love with his wife ? [SEP]
[CLS] his feelings gave him away when megan asked , ` ` are you hurting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she gave him a skeptical look , he replied , ` ` it ' s more the fact that i ' m angry than i am physically hurt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what exactly was all that about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , as she da ##bbed some anti ##se ##ptic along his jaw ##line . [SEP]
[CLS] he winced when the medication hit the broken skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my brother is angry with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no shit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she held the cotton ball frozen as she eyed him curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what i ' m wondering is what got him so fired up that he would st ##omp into a hospital , call you out , and then punch you ? [SEP]
[CLS] you are the last person on earth i would imagine being in a fight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the reason is so cl ##iche , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` en ##light ##en me , ' ' she urged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s a pet ##ula ##nt child who did n ' t get his way - he ' s lash ##ing out at me because he thinks it ' s all my fault . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i heard the name mia . [SEP]
[CLS] was it all about a woman ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that ' s why i called it cl ##iche . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sucked in a harsh breath before filling megan in about what all had trans ##pired between him , dev , and mia . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , ' ' she murmured , when he finished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose that is all one can say about the situation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were awful ##ly kind to take care of her like you did - i mean , with both her abusive ex - boyfriend and dev . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else was i supposed to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] i cared for her , and i wanted to see her happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the look that flashed in megan ' s eyes , he quickly added , ` ` there was no amor ##ous love between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i was happily married at the time , and she desperately needed someone to be strong for her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cupped his un ##hur ##t cheek in her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really are the most decent man i ' ve ever known . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know about that , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you truly are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no wonder women are so crazy about you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s one thing for you to be so good - looking and a smart doctor , but then when you add in the fact of how sweet , caring , and compassionate you are , it ' s like you ' re a triple threat . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to throw the cotton ball into the trash can . [SEP]
[CLS] his heartbeat thru ##mme ##d louder and louder at her words while he sat un ##bl ##inking and un ##mo ##ving . [SEP]
[CLS] part of him wanted to rail at her for not seeing him like all the other women did . [SEP]
[CLS] if she truly saw what others did , then she would want to date him , would n ' t she ? [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t she see how good he could be for her ? [SEP]
[CLS] when megan met his tense gaze , she jerked back and momentarily faltered by dropping the piece of ga ##uze in her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly deposited the soil ##ed one in the trash and then got another one . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so this mia chick , she ' s run off with some drummer , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , clearly trying to change the subject and light ##en the mood in the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not just any drummer . [SEP]
[CLS] a famous one at that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] what band ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s cocked his head as he tried remembering . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something train . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not runaway train ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he snapped his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] clapping her hand to her chest , megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know someone who knows aj res ##end ##iz ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose i do if you consider that ' s mia ' s fiance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is so wild . [SEP]
[CLS] i love that band . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see if i can get you an auto ##graph . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a sq ##ue ##al , megan said , ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] that would be amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything for the woman who is willing to risk her life for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was nothing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about your hand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not going to lie . [SEP]
[CLS] it hurts . [SEP]
[CLS] i kinda forgot what punching someone felt like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help his brows from rising in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you done a lot of fighting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly mma material , am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he merely shook his head , she replied , ` ` i may have thrown a few punches in my early college party ##ing days when a guy overs ##te ##pped his bounds . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a smile , pe ##sh said , ` ` good for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , my dad was really big on teaching me self - defense moves . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , with him being ex - military . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t help liking megan ' s strength and spun ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t known a lot of women like her . [SEP]
[CLS] in his world , women were bred to be dem ##ure and obe ##die ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] even though jade was n ' t indian , she would ' ve never dreamed of throwing a punch to defend him against dev . [SEP]
[CLS] but megan , she was so refreshing with her ability to stand up for herself and others - to voice her mind whether it was good or bad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would have made your father very proud today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure later on today when my knuckles are br ##uising , he ' ll want to know why . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m very sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand in his before bringing it to his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s a kiss to make any bruises go away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a teasing smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that the best medicine you can do , dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his mind went wild with illicit images of all the ` ` medicine ' ' and ` ` healing ' ' he could give her . [SEP]
[CLS] a cha ##ste kiss to alleviate her pain was all he could really offer . [SEP]
[CLS] his page ##r went off before he could reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i better go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he hopped off the table and started for the door . [SEP]
[CLS] as his hand hovered over the door ##k ##nob , there were so many things he wanted to say to her . [SEP]
[CLS] but finally , he just said , ` ` thanks again for taking care of me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you should probably ice your hand during your break tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes sir , ' ' she replied , with a mock salute . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head at her with a smile before heading out the door . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twelve days melted into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinical ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] every day she found a new challenge to conquer . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t imagined how hard it would be , or how exhausted she would be most nights when she crawled into bed . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was a thrilling exhaustion because she was doing what she felt like she was called to do . [SEP]
[CLS] each day , she spent more and more time with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved working beside him on cases . [SEP]
[CLS] he had the best bedside manner of all the residents and intern ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] patients , both young and old , adored him . [SEP]
[CLS] and the more she was with him , the more megan began to ad ##ore him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] she had just left an examining room where he had charm ##ed a little boy into finally letting them run the tests they needed when kris ##ti beck ##oned her from down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] after hu ##st ##ling to join kris ##ti , megan was quickly ushered inside one of the trauma rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately , her entire body switched gears as she prepared herself for what she might face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` female , thirty , car accident , ' ' the para ##med ##ic began before rattling off her vital ##s and other information . [SEP]
[CLS] after megan had absorbed the information , she turned to the patient . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , i ' m megan . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to get your iv started . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the woman gave megan a weak smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m mary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess it would be wrong to say it ' s nice to meet you , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan said , trying to talk as normally as she could to put the patient at ease . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i guess so , ' ' mary replied . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan reached for mary ' s arm to find a place for the needle , mary winced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ou ##ch . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan surveyed the forearm , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks like you ' ve got a break there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my arm is broken ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mary asked in a panic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we wo n ' t know until we get you into x - ray . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to try this vein here in your wrist . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the needle slipped easily into the vein , and megan started the iv . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh appeared in the doorway then . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled at mary on the gurney . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , mary , i ' m dr . nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] i understand you had a little accident today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this car came out of nowhere and hit me head on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t we start by you telling me where it hurts ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my chest , ' ' she said , with a grimace . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh pulled back the hospital gown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` were you wearing your seat belt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i always do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from the dust in your hair , can i assume the air ##bag deployed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , it did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this where it hurts ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , running his fingers down an angry red w ##hel ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] it started at her neck and crossed over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] some of it was hidden by the many leads coming from the heart monitor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it looks like the seat belt and the air ##bag did a number on you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mary winced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought they were supposed to help you , not hurt you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust me . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re much better off with a little burn than if you had n ' t been wearing it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after eyeing the monitors mary was hooked up to , he turned to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` blood pressure is low . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s administer some blood products to raise it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] after checking mary ' s chart for her blood type , she grabbed a bag of blood from the cooler ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] trading places with pe ##sh , she started another iv in the crook of mary ' s right elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides your chest , are you hurting anywhere else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , after he finished listening to her heart and lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my stomach . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s breath hitch ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] it was never good for a car accident patient to have stomach pains . [SEP]
[CLS] that usually meant hem ##or ##rh ##aging , which could also attribute the low blood pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] pressing on mary ' s abdomen , pe ##sh asked , ` ` does this hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a sc ##ree ##ch came from the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s brows drew with worry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to do a quick ultrasound , mary . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to see what ' s causing the pain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pulled the machine over to the bedside . [SEP]
[CLS] she sq ##ui ##rted the jelly onto mary ' s stomach , and then pe ##sh began running the wand over the skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m feeling a little dizzy , too , ' ' mary said , in a low voice . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh and megan exchanged a quick look before he shoved the ultrasound machine back . [SEP]
[CLS] turning to kris ##ti , he said , ` ` call the or . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s got a ru ##pt ##ured sp ##leen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after de ##pressing the break on the gurney , pe ##sh swung it out of the trauma room and started down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go with him , ' ' kris ##ti instructed , as she held onto the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] megan jogged down the hall to catch up with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] he smacked the buttons on the elevator before glancing down at mary . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stay with me , okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re going to get you into surgery , and then you ' ll be good as new . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] without hesitation , pe ##sh replied , ` ` yes , but you have to stay with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the elevator ' s doors slid open . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan helped pe ##sh push the gurney inside , mary asked , ` ` did you turn on more lights ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cr ##eased her brows in worry as she glanced over to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re getting in the elevator to take you to the or for surgery , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it ' s so bright , ' ' mary whispered before closing her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] her head lo ##lled to the side just as the alarms on the monitors began sc ##ree ##ching in megan ' s ears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dammit , she ' s crashing ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh cried . [SEP]
[CLS] ice - cold fear prick ##ed its way from the top of megan ' s head all the way down her body . [SEP]
[CLS] a patient was crashing in the elevator without the crash cart . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell were they supposed to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lower the gurney , ' ' pe ##sh ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s jerk ##y hands fumbled with the lever . [SEP]
[CLS] once it was flat , pe ##sh brought his hands to mary ' s chest and began compression ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] without having to be told , megan leaned down , pinched mary ' s nose , and began breathing into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] they worked in perfect sync ##hr ##oni ##zation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stay with me , mary ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh barked , as his hands pumped in a mani ##c pace up and down on mary ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing up from her breathing , megan eyed the monitors . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no pulse . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh did n ' t respond , she continued doing breathing cycles . [SEP]
[CLS] at the taste of something warm meeting her lips , she jerked back . [SEP]
[CLS] blood o ##oz ##ed out of mary ' s mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s more damage than the sp ##leen . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s bleeding from the mouth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh did n ' t even acknowledge her comment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the seat belt and air ##bag could have caused an ao ##rti ##c tear as well . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s nothing we can do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he kept right on with his compression ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the elevator doors opened , and megan met the expect ##ant faces of the surgical team . [SEP]
[CLS] when one doctor stepped forward , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh growled across from her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , she is n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] we have to keep trying . [SEP]
[CLS] get a cart in here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor eyed the stats on the monitors . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think it will help . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jerking his head up from mary , pe ##sh snarled , ` ` get the f * * king cart ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as one of the nurses scrambled away , two others pulled the gurney from the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] megan stood back , feeling helpless as to what to do . [SEP]
[CLS] once the cart arrived , pe ##sh ripped open mary ' s gown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` charging 260 jo ##ules . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rubbed the paddle ##s together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` clear ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mary ' s chest jolted off the gurney with the force of the electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] megan did n ' t need to look at the monitors . [SEP]
[CLS] the heart stayed in a flat line . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` charging 360 jo ##ules . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan closed her eyes when pe ##sh administered the second shock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dammit , jade , do n ' t do this ! [SEP]
[CLS] try for me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t hold back the gasp that escaped her at pe ##sh calling mary by his late wife ' s name . [SEP]
[CLS] before pe ##sh could do another charge , one of the surgeon ' s stepped forward . [SEP]
[CLS] after he removed his mask , he put his hand on pe ##sh ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` calling time of death . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] defeated , pe ##sh dropped his head . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , he eased back from the gurney . [SEP]
[CLS] a nurse took the paddle ##s from him and put them back on the cart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go not ##ify the family , ' ' pe ##sh murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] the surgeon shook his head and stared pointedly at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get a resident to do that . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een , you go take a breathe ##r , buddy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they deserve to speak to the doctor who was with her when she died . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t need to do this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh slung away from the surgeon and started for the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] megan knew there was no point in arguing with him or trying to get one of the residents to take his place . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know if she should try to go to him or not . [SEP]
[CLS] she regretted her decision when he turned to face her in the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression was ago ##ni ##zing ##ly broken . [SEP]
[CLS] as the doors closed , her heart ached for him . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew any doctor hated to lose a patient , especially a young one , but this went far deeper than that . [SEP]
[CLS] from his behavior , megan knew that mary ' s death had exposed a raw nerve in pe ##sh - one that after two years still had n ' t healed . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow he had seen his wife in mary , and once again , he was n ' t able to save her . [SEP]
[CLS] after she had escorted mary ' s body back upstairs to wait on the funeral home , megan went in search of pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t find him in any of the exam rooms , nor was he in the doctors ' lounge or break room . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she went to kris ##ti for answers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you see where dr . nad ##een went ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti gave her a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll probably find him on the roof . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s brows shot up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the roof ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whenever he has a really bad day about his wife - ' ' she sucked in a breath when she realized she might have said too much . [SEP]
[CLS] at the thought of pe ##sh ' s grief , megan ' s chest tightened in agony . [SEP]
[CLS] he was too good of a man to have to suffer like he did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so he goes up to the roof ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan finished for kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he likes to be alone to clear his head . [SEP]
[CLS] although none of us would say anything , he usually ends up pulling another shift to make up for the time he was gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] of course pe ##sh would do something like that . [SEP]
[CLS] he was honorable every moment of his life , even after those of immense grief . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she knew he probably wanted and needed to be alone , megan wanted to check on him . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t bear the thoughts of him suffering so much . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , if it ' s okay , i think i ' ll go ahead and take my dinner break . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti gave her a knowing look before nodding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] go right ahead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled before brushing past kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] she bypassed the break room where her purse was . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she kept going . [SEP]
[CLS] after a brisk walk down the hall , she got to the authorized personnel only stairwell . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t dare use the elevator shaft where trauma patients were brought in from being airlift ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] without hesitation , megan swiped her access card . [SEP]
[CLS] when the lock clicked , she flung the door open and started up the flights of stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] she was wind ##ed when she reached the top . [SEP]
[CLS] cautiously , her hand hovered over the door ##k ##nob . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help wondering what she might find on the other side . [SEP]
[CLS] would pe ##sh be an emotional mess ? [SEP]
[CLS] would he be angry that she had interrupted his private gr ##ieving ? [SEP]
[CLS] shaking the thoughts from her head , she flung open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] as she stepped onto the roof , the air grew cooler . [SEP]
[CLS] a breeze rippled her scrub ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze spun around frantically until she found him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh stood at the edge of the roof . [SEP]
[CLS] his usual ram ##rod straight posture was slumped , his broad shoulders drawn in . [SEP]
[CLS] although she could n ' t see his face , his gaze seemed fixed straight ahead into the night sky . [SEP]
[CLS] to add insult to injury , clouds b ##lot ##ted out the stars , cloak ##ing everything in darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] tentatively , she started over to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] he whirled around in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart clenched at the sight of the tears sparkling in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] even in the darkness , she could see a blood - red flush entering his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands quickly came up to sw ##ipe away the moisture from his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , ' ' he finally replied in a hoarse whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] they stood in an awkward silence , staring each other down . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , megan took a step forward to close the gap between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you know i was up here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` kris ##ti told me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] unable to stop herself , she reached out to touch his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is n ' t necessary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , it is . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re in pain . . . you ' ve been in pain . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t help but feel sorry for what you ' re going through . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his usually warm eyes took on a cold look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were in that elevator , too . [SEP]
[CLS] you have every right to be emotional . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe you should be more concerned with why you are n ' t weeping . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t try to mask your pain by being someone you ' re not or by pointing fingers at others . [SEP]
[CLS] that is n ' t you , and you ca n ' t fool me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a ragged sigh , pe ##sh jerked his hand through his dark , wavy hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] that was completely un ##cal ##led for . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s - ' ' she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] when she pulled her hand away , he sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` talk to me , ' ' megan pleaded . [SEP]
[CLS] the clouds above them opened up , causing a slight dr ##iz ##zle to fall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the death of a patient is never easy . [SEP]
[CLS] any doctor of worth , or nurse for that matter , must possess compassion . [SEP]
[CLS] then it is inevitable that the same compassion you possess will come back to haunt you - it may even cr ##ip ##ple you . [SEP]
[CLS] when death comes , you ca n ' t help feeling for the life that has been lost and for the family members left behind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his voice choked off , and megan drew herself even closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that his last statement held personal meaning for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what exactly happened to your wife ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned softly . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s eyes closed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jade had an und ##ia ##gno ##sed cl ##otti ##ng condition . [SEP]
[CLS] she was adopted , so she did n ' t know anything really about her family history . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always been in perfect health - she rarely even went to the doctor with the sniff ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] and after we ' d been married for three years , we decided it was time to have a baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh remained silent , megan tentatively asked , ` ` did she die in childbirth ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , we never got that far . [SEP]
[CLS] we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own , and it did n ' t happen . [SEP]
[CLS] so we were recommended to a fertility clinic . [SEP]
[CLS] once the i ##ui process did n ' t work , we started iv ##f . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a ragged sigh came from deep in his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the whole process was physically trying and then emotionally gut ##ting for both of us , but especially for jade . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he met her gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she blamed herself since the testing revealed that everything was fine with me . [SEP]
[CLS] although we were labeled as ' non - specific in ##fer ##tility , ' she felt that it was all her fault . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bless her heart , ' ' megan murmured , as her heart went out to a woman she ' d never met . [SEP]
[CLS] getting pregnant had been so easy for her . [SEP]
[CLS] although mason was n ' t necessarily expected , he had never been unwanted in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] but she knew what in ##fer ##tility did to a woman when she saw it ra ##va ##ge her father ' s sister . [SEP]
[CLS] although her aunt was now the happy and dot ##ing mother of two adopted girls , she knew the emotional to ##il not getting pregnant had taken . [SEP]
[CLS] megan , herself , had once been the recipient of her aunt ' s childless pain when she had announced her pregnancy with mason . [SEP]
[CLS] still without answers as to how jade had died , megan pressed pe ##sh for more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what happened with the iv ##f ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she got pregnant on the first transfer only to mis ##car ##ry three weeks later . [SEP]
[CLS] we had just been through another transfer when she died . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s adam ' s apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could only imagine he was trying to keep his emotions in check . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he spoke again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she had an em ##bol ##ism most likely brought on by the fertility medication . [SEP]
[CLS] i was in the kitchen making breakfast when i heard a crash in the bedroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tears poole ##d in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i called her name and she did n ' t answer , i ran back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was crumpled on the bedroom floor . [SEP]
[CLS] after calling 911 , i did cp ##r over and over again , but i could never revive her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh pe ##sh , ' ' megan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] the weight of his pain was so heavy that even she found it hard to breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] without looking at her , he continued staring straight ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from what the medical examiner said , i have some peace in knowing she did n ' t suffer - that she went quickly without any fear or pain . [SEP]
[CLS] one minute she was getting ready for work , and the next she was gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s true that there is some peace , especially the fact she did n ' t know she was going to die . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes i ca n ' t imagine what it must be like for terminal patients . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shuddered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you wonder if every day is your last , when you have to think about all you ' re going to miss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that is true , ' ' he said , in a hushed whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] when he finally turned to look at her , he gave her a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s been two years . [SEP]
[CLS] every time i think i ' ve moved on , that i ' ve been able to compartment ##ali ##ze my grief , a case comes through that brings me to my knees . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , ' ' megan murmured , bringing her hand up to cup his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned his face into her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] his head bowed until their forehead ##s met . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to remember that no matter what happened to your wife , and to mary , it was n ' t your fault . [SEP]
[CLS] you were n ' t responsible . [SEP]
[CLS] you need to keep living . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re alive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head up , she gazed into his dark brown eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re alive , ' ' she repeated . [SEP]
[CLS] the rain began to fall harder . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyelids fluttered to keep the moisture out of her eyes as she gazed up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth hovered next to hers , his breath warming her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] she could barely breathe in that moment . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like every molecule in her body was pulsing with need . [SEP]
[CLS] silently , she pleaded with her eyes for him to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] and then , after what felt like an eternity , he slid his lips over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t the first time she had kissed him - it was just the first time she was sober and had kissed him . [SEP]
[CLS] now her senses were heightened , and she could experience exactly what she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips were tender and soft at first , and then they switched over to desperate and demanding . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like he was breathing her in with every brush of his lips and stroke of his tongue as if to prove to himself that he truly was alive . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue danced along hers , causing her to moan . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his hands up to cup her face while her arms went around his chest , pulling him closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] drops of rain pe ##lt ##ed her head and ran down her cheeks while pe ##sh ' s white coat grew moist as she ran her hands up and down his back . [SEP]
[CLS] she realized , in a dizzy ##ing flu ##rry , that no man had ever kissed her like this before . [SEP]
[CLS] this was like love ##making with their mouths , and she never wanted it to end . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh finally tore his lips from hers , megan ' s breaths came in heaving pants . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes opened to stare up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression turned from lust to anguish . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh , you don ' t - ' ' he held up his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , just go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned away from her , wrapping his arms around his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] torn , megan did n ' t know if she should argue with him and stay or leave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' he whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] with her heart still beating wildly from their passionate lip - lock , she turned and fled . [SEP]
[CLS] as she pounded back down the stairs , her emotions yo - yo ##ed to where she felt like a watch that had been wound too tight . [SEP]
[CLS] after bursting back through the door , kris ##ti met her in the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened at megan ' s appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i , uh , i went outside on my dinner break , and it started raining , ' ' megan lied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` next time you ' ll have to remember your umbrella , ' ' kris ##ti replied . [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you go to the break room ? [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a hair dry ##er under the sink . [SEP]
[CLS] when you finish drying off , i could really use you in the supply closet doing inventory . [SEP]
[CLS] seems like we always almost run out of everything at once . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] i can do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan turned to go down the hallway , kris ##ti reached out and grabbed her arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is he okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan bit down on her lip to keep a hysterical laugh from escaping . [SEP]
[CLS] was pe ##sh okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] was she okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] who the hell knew ? [SEP]
[CLS] one minute he ' d been weeping about his wife and losing a patient , and the next he ' d been liquid passion dripping on her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of his emotional whip ##lash , she ' d experienced the same . [SEP]
[CLS] she now found herself wanting more of his kisses when she should n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was n ' t just the kiss she wanted - she wanted all of him and not just for sex . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he ' s not . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess he ' s just trying to accept the loss , both past and present , as best he can , ' ' she finally replied . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti nodded in acknowledge ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan felt she was free from any more questioning , she hurried down the hall to the break room . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she found it empty . [SEP]
[CLS] after grabbing a brush from her purse , she went to the sink to grab the hair dry ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing at her reflection in the mirror , she looked a bed ##rag ##gled mess . [SEP]
[CLS] she was practically washed out except for her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] they were swollen and bright red from pe ##sh ' s kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] her finger came up to trace her bottom lip . [SEP]
[CLS] as memories of his kisses filled her mind , she tried desperately to think of anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , she had gone up to the roof to somehow save pe ##sh , and instead , she had lost herself to him and his emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter thirteen pe ##sh regret ##fully watched megan ' s retreating form . [SEP]
[CLS] he cursed under his breath as she disappeared into the stairwell . [SEP]
[CLS] what was his problem ? [SEP]
[CLS] the woman had been merely comforting him , and he had allowed his li ##bid ##o to take over . [SEP]
[CLS] he had promised her he would keep his distance . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of the flirting and easy ban ##ter between them , he had kept things professional . [SEP]
[CLS] now she probably felt trapped and harassed by him . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to talk to him about it , and he ' d dismissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] he paced around the rooftop as the rain that had soaked him to the bone began to di ##ssi ##pate . [SEP]
[CLS] his mind was a jang ##led mess of thoughts and emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] one voice argued over and over that megan had wanted him to kiss her - that the look in her eyes told the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] but pe ##sh worried that in his agony he had mis ##rea ##d the signals she may or may not have been giving . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , he ' d made a terrible situation even worse by not being able to control his feelings for megan . [SEP]
[CLS] with a frustrated grunt , he realized he had to make things right with her . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed to apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] casting one last look out over the horizon , he then turned and started for the stairwell . [SEP]
[CLS] after pounding downstairs , he searched the hallway for any signs of megan . [SEP]
[CLS] when he spotted kris ##ti , he was surprised not to see megan with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' s megan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , since we ' re kinda slow tonight , i asked her to go work in the storage closet . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re behind on inventory and catalog ##uing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti eyed him up and down before shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re drenched . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s raining outside . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i ' ve heard , ' ' she said knowing ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what does that mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she waved her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t you do us both a favor and go get out of those wet clothes ? [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing we need is you coming down with something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh knew it was fruit ##less to argue with her . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he tucked his tail between his legs and made his way to the doctors ' lounge . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a clean pair of pants and shirt out of his locker . [SEP]
[CLS] after he slid on a new white coat , he strode down the hall to the medicine closet . [SEP]
[CLS] after sw ##ip ##ing his key card , he entered the room . [SEP]
[CLS] when he closed the door behind him , megan turned around , gazing expect ##antly at him . [SEP]
[CLS] now that he was in front of her , he did n ' t know exactly what to say . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been on an emotional over ##load on the roof , and things had escalated far too quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , i just want to say how very sorry i am about kissing you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well i ' m not , ' ' she replied matter - of - fact ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s neck snapped back in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] her response was n ' t what he was expecting at all . [SEP]
[CLS] he had imagined she might be relieved or even embarrassed , but he had n ' t imagined that she would be un ##re ##gre ##tf ##ul . [SEP]
[CLS] he cleared his throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless , i should n ' t have done it . [SEP]
[CLS] i was in an emotionally vulnerable position , and you were merely trying to comfort me . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his words were more for his own good than hers . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just because i was comforting you , does n ' t mean i did n ' t want you to kiss me . [SEP]
[CLS] that i still do n ' t want to kiss you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows furrowed in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you - ' ' ` ` pe ##sh , i ' ve wanted you since the night of noah ' s baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] but you shot me down then , and you still do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although his heart wanted to so ##ar at her admission of wanting him , the reality of her words caused his chest to clench instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sexually . [SEP]
[CLS] you only want me sexually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he should have been flat ##tered that a young , sexy woman like megan desired him . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] half of the women in the hospital would be willing for him to drag them to an empty patient ' s room for a quick and dirty screw . [SEP]
[CLS] but that ' s not who he was . [SEP]
[CLS] he had never been that way with women , and he did n ' t see how it could be possible to change . [SEP]
[CLS] all he wanted was for her to really see him and how good he could be for her . [SEP]
[CLS] how good they would be for each other . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought that was what she was feeling in the moments before and after he kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] but now it seemed it was once again only lust . [SEP]
[CLS] although it was probably pointless , he could n ' t help putting everything out there once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but when we were up on the roof , there was n ' t a moment where you wanted more from me than just sex ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he licked his lips and took a step toward her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a second where you could imagine your life with me in it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan stared at him , her expression con ##tem ##pl ##ative . [SEP]
[CLS] for a brief moment , pe ##sh thought by her hesitation that she had changed her mind about him . [SEP]
[CLS] but then she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many times are you going to make me hurt you with this ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re too good for me , pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] we both know that . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll remind you again of some of the reasons i ' m not the one for you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m twenty - five , and you ' re thirty - seven . [SEP]
[CLS] you want a wife , and i ' m not ready to be married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her words cut into his chest the same as if she had taken a sharp blade to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she may have had to repeat herself this time , but he realized the final ##ity of her words . [SEP]
[CLS] and then an idea hit him so hard that he shuddered - a true light bulb moment and ep ##ip ##han ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] there was only one way he was going to get to have his sweet megan , and that was if he gave in to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he would have to become someone else for her , even if it was just for a little while . [SEP]
[CLS] he could distract her with sex that she both desired and demanded , but at the same time , he would make her fall in love with him . [SEP]
[CLS] it could work . [SEP]
[CLS] it had to . [SEP]
[CLS] cock ##ing his head at her , he questioned , ` ` so let me get this straight once and for all . [SEP]
[CLS] you would let me . . . ' ' he paused , fighting the conflict within himself to say what he needed to . [SEP]
[CLS] he drew in a ragged breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would let me f * * k you but not love you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened at his word choice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s gotten into you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged non ##chal ##antly , feeling slightly empowered in the dr . je ##ky ##ll and mr . hyde moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i merely asked a simple question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snorted exasperated ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , about . . . ' ' she swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fucking , of all things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head wildly back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can barely acknowledge hearing you say the word , least of all you doing that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t imagine me - ' ' she held up her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not the type of man to f * * k , ' ' she countered . [SEP]
[CLS] crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , ` ` oh really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m too nice of a guy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am a man , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] we all have needs . [SEP]
[CLS] is n ' t f * * king one of them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her body trembled slightly at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] she licked her lips before reply ##ing , ` ` s - stop saying that word - it is n ' t you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , f * * king is n ' t me ? [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t tell me you think i ' m totally as ##ex ##ual - that you ca n ' t imagine me f * * king a woman . . . fucking you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he eased in closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f * * k me the night of noah ' s baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] given the chance right now , you ' d let me strip off your scrub ##s and f * * k you up against the medicine cabinet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as her chest heaved up and down , she took a step back from him , bump ##ing against the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you do n ' t say things like that . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re refined . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re a gentleman , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it may have been a while , but even a gentleman like me enjoys f * * king . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he closed the gap between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m giving you what you want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re giving in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he dipped his head , his mouth hovered over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you really want me to take you , then kiss me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without a moment ' s hesitation , megan crashed her lips against his . [SEP]
[CLS] the kiss was hard and desperately seeking more . [SEP]
[CLS] as his tongue thrust into her mouth , his hand came to her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] tenderly , he cupped the flesh , feeling the weight fill his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##sat ##is ##fied with the lack of contact , he pulled his hand away and slid it underneath megan ' s top . [SEP]
[CLS] over her bra , he kn ##ead ##ed her breast again , feeling her nipple harden under his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt his erection grow at the sound of her whimper . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and kiss every inch of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s mouth popped off of his , and she stared up at him with hooded eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about someone finding us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll lock the door , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] reluctantly , he pulled away from her to walk back over to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] after he turned the lock , he made sure to push a box in front of it as well . [SEP]
[CLS] they would have enough warning if someone were to try to use their card to come in . [SEP]
[CLS] with his hands on her shoulders , he steered her behind one of the floor - to - ceiling shelves , conceal ##ing them even further from potential pry ##ing eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now where were we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned and wrapped her arms around his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you were getting acquainted with second base . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i remember now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] instead of his hands going back to her br * * sts , he pulled her flush against him . [SEP]
[CLS] as his lips met hers , he slipped his arms around her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabbed the globe ##s of her ass and squeezed , causing megan to moan into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands gripped her flesh , urging her upward . [SEP]
[CLS] rising on her tip ##to ##es , she allowed him to ho ##ist her up . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs wrapped around his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] once he had secured her to him , he rammed them back , until they bumped into the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] he ground his pe ##lvis into her core , letting her feel how much he truly wanted her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' she murmured , as he continued rubbing against her . [SEP]
[CLS] one of her hands abandoned his shoulder and slid down his back to squeeze his ass . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers jerked her hair back , pulling her lips back from his . [SEP]
[CLS] he gazed into her heavy lid ##ded eyes before his mouth dipped to her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue slid up her jug ##ular , feeling her racing pulse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ll let me inside your body but not your heart ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] please pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] now that he had her right where he wanted her , it was time to put his plan into motion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if i give you an orgasm , you ' ll have to go on a date with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened through her panting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t be serious . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , but i am . [SEP]
[CLS] give and take , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] i give you what you want - ' ' he paused in his thrusts to let his fingers dip into the waist band of her scrub ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] through the thin scrap of her thong , his hand caressed her , causing her to whimper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which is to explode in bliss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he continued stroking her , she hissed in a breath as she glared at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want me pretty bad , do n ' t you , megan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , as his fingertips felt of her growing moisture . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingernails dug into his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] god , yes , i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so let me give you this pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] i want nothing more than to see you come apart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he licked his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you ' ll let me take you out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyelids fluttered , and she bit down on her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell she was internally raging war with herself about what to do . [SEP]
[CLS] as his fingers sped up their tempo against her clit , her head fell back against the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t play fair , ' ' she groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] he momentarily eased his hand off of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to play games with you at all , but you leave me no choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he lowered his head to kiss her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all i want is you , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned , as he looked her in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` make me come , and i ' ll go out on a date with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled before easing her back onto her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] when he sank to his knees before her , megan ' s brows furrowed in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] he then gripped the waistband of her scrub ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he eased them down , along with her panties , never taking his eyes off hers . [SEP]
[CLS] when he had them down to her ankles , he rose back up . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing her by the waist , he shifted her to the side where she bumped into the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] he gripped her h * ps once again and raised her up to where her butt rested on the cool form ##ica . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid her pants and thong over her shoes , letting the drop into floor below him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so far gone with desire that he did n ' t stop to think how long it had been since he had gone down on a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] he pushed the voices out of his head when they reminded him of how jade had teasing ##ly called his tongue a master of orgasm ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he focused on the beautiful , panting woman before him as she widened her legs inviting ##ly for him . [SEP]
[CLS] when he slid his tongue slowly up megan ' s wet slit , they both shuddered . [SEP]
[CLS] he took one of her legs and propped her foot on his shoulder , so he could get better access to her while he pushed her other thigh further open . [SEP]
[CLS] her pink , glistening center was laid out beautifully before him . [SEP]
[CLS] as his tongue flicked and teased her swollen clit , megan threw her head back and moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips closed over her clit , sucking it hard . [SEP]
[CLS] her h * ps began to rock back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew it was n ' t going to take him long to make her come - she was too ready for this . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a long time for her as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he resisted using his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he spread her apart and then thrust his tongue rhythmic ##ally inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s cries grew louder to where he brought his hand up and clamped it over her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing they needed was someone banging on the door . [SEP]
[CLS] as he felt her walls tens ##ing , she reached out to twist her fingers in his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] he welcomed the pain as she went over the edge , con ##vu ##ls ##ing and screaming against his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan ' s walls finishing clenching and pulsing , pe ##sh removed his tongue from inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] he placed butterfly kisses against her core and then on the insides of her thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] when he finally glanced up , he found megan staring at him , a comb ##ust ##ive mix of emotions swirling in her blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was . . . ' ' smiling , he rose up from the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands gently came to her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] he was just about to pull her down when she stopped him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t even feel my legs right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brushed her hair back from her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it has been a long time , has n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about never has it been like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help staring at her inc ##red ##ulously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , that i ' ve never gotten off like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a sheep ##ish grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least not with a man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at her ins ##in ##uation , he felt warmth enter his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you blushing about me mentioning mast ##ur ##bat ##ing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m not , ' ' he protested fee ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really are something else , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hell yes . [SEP]
[CLS] one minute you ' ve got your tongue buried inside me , giving me the most intense orgasm of my life , and then the next you ' re blushing . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like you became another person a few minutes ago . [SEP]
[CLS] you were forceful and dom ##ine ##ering . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a shudder rippled through her as she raised her brows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you always get like that when it comes to sex ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh felt even more warmth creeping into his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] how she could talk so frankly without any pants on , he had no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should cover you up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were enjoying the view a few minutes ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned over and winked at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a very up - close and personal view . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rubbed his hands over his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly , i do n ' t know what came over me . [SEP]
[CLS] i came in here to tell you i was sorry and that you would n ' t have to worry about me coming on to you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and then all hell had broken loose . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like he had been fried with the electrical current from the paddle ##s on the crash cart . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d decided to become another person to win her and damned if he had . [SEP]
[CLS] almost too easily for his liking . [SEP]
[CLS] what had he said to her in the heat of the moment ? [SEP]
[CLS] he stared intently at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all i could think of was how much i wanted you and what it would take to have you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really wanted me that much ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her brows rising in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a co ##y smile , she scooted to the edge of the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrapped her legs around his waist and drew him closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , as her hand cupped his erection through his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] his h * ps buck ##ed in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily , and he closed his eyes , trying to steady himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this was n ' t about me , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t let you go back on the floor with a hard - on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she licked up the side of his face , causing him to shudder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i owe you at least a happy ending after those multiple orgasm ##s you just gave me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his closed eyes popped open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` multiple did you say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then that means you owe me multiple dates , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan reached around to smack his ass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a bad boy trying to trick me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i play dirty when i have to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , megan un ##bu ##tton ##ed and un ##zi ##pped him . [SEP]
[CLS] she eased his pants and boxer shorts off his hips . [SEP]
[CLS] when his erection was freed , she glanced between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , pretty impressive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he started to laugh at her remark , but when she gripped him in her hand , he gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] all coherent thoughts flew out of his mind as she stroked his length up and down , alternating from smooth slides to hard tugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you rather it was my mouth on you than my hand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` feels good no matter what , ' ' he muttered , his head dipping to rest against her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] her breath sc ##or ##ched against his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , i love that you ' re so hard . [SEP]
[CLS] just for me , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' he panted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just for you . [SEP]
[CLS] only you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] flicking her tongue out , she encircled his lobe and the shell of his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you imagine what it would be like to bury yourself deep inside me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her words were having too much of an effect on him . [SEP]
[CLS] the dirty talk , coupled with the way she had her hand on him , caused him to tighten up . [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to pull away , but she kept hold of him . [SEP]
[CLS] and then he was coming undone . [SEP]
[CLS] when he finally came back to himself , he opened his eyes to see that he ' d come on megan ' s exposed thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] it was worth it to see your o face . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled dream ##ily at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , you were beautiful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] since he ' d never had a woman tell him that , he could n ' t help flushing . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled away from her to search for something to clean her up with . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he found a roll of paper towels . [SEP]
[CLS] when he returned to her , he gently wiped himself off her skin . [SEP]
[CLS] after he finished , he helped her down off the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go out first . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to clean up . [SEP]
[CLS] and so do you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave a brief nod . [SEP]
[CLS] he was having trouble processing all the emotions swirling through his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so when it is ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when is what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked dumb ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] he was still far too ob ##lite ##rated by a simple hand job to be processing coherent thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he had almost forgotten what he asked of her . [SEP]
[CLS] out of the heat of the moment , he felt guilty for what he had done . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i was n ' t being fair . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t owe me a date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i always keep my promises . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re really going to go out with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his heartbeat sped up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you off this saturday ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have plans ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you can get someone to watch your son ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ##ss ##s , ' ' she replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , then let ' s do it saturday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do what exactly ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , but what are we doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure i like the sound of that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise you ' ll like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what should i wear for this surprise date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] already the wheels had been turning in his head . [SEP]
[CLS] since it might be his only chance , he knew he wanted to make the date as special as he could . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wear something dress ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] we might be going somewhere that requires more formal wear than jeans . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i think i can do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of his page ##r , he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess i ' ll be the one leaving first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without he ##sit ##ating , he bowed his head to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] just like before , the feel of her mouth against his lit him on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] reluctantly , he pulled away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go wash up first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her breath warmed his cheek before she glanced up into his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can taste myself on you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he closed his eyes as a shudder went through his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re trying to kill me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she flashed him a wicked grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the truth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` behave yourself , ' ' he replied , before he headed to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fourteen with less than ten minutes before pe ##sh was set to arrive for their date , megan found herself a ne ##uro ##tic mess still hole ##d in the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d changed outfits at least three times before deciding on a black and white lace dress that came just to her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] it had actually come out of the back of her closet - one of the tame ##r remnants of her wilder days . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh had told her to wear something dress ##y , and it did fall into the dress ##y category , although it was probably a little sex ##ier than she would have liked . [SEP]
[CLS] while she ' d pulled her long hair back into a loose knot at the back of her neck , she was now re ##thi ##nk ##ing her strategy . [SEP]
[CLS] if she ' d left her hair down , it would cover more of the exposed skin that the spaghetti straps and neck of the dress showed . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at her phone one more time , she cringed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck it , ' ' she muttered , before sp ##rit ##zing on some perfume . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fra ##grant cloud faded , she headed out of the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed her purse and headed upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came into the kitchen , a loud , cat - calling whistle pierced her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] she scowled at sean . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look hot , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] gavin , who stood beside sean at the counter , nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we never see you in anything but scrub ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help smiling at her brothers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] wa ##gging his brows , gavin asked , ` ` got a hot date , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly , ' ' she replied , as she went to grab her purse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah right , ' ' he mumbled under his breath . [SEP]
[CLS] after sling ##ing her purse on her shoulder , she whirled around to pin him with her stare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what ' s that supposed to mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it means that chicks do n ' t get dressed up like that for nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] you obviously want to impress this guy . [SEP]
[CLS] so , it ' s obviously a hot date . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since when did you become the love guru ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] sean grinned as he elbow ##ed gavin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s getting ri ##led , man . [SEP]
[CLS] being irrational about little things usually means love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan opened her mouth to lay into her brothers , but then found herself speechless , so she closed it back up . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word to her brothers , she went into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] she found her dad lou ##nging in his chair with mason snuggled to his side . [SEP]
[CLS] when her dad looked up , he did a double take . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you look beautiful , sweetheart , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] she bent down and kissed his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , daddy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason tore his gaze away from the television to look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mommy , bye - bye ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] this was one question she had n ' t anticipated explaining . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , mommy is going to go see a friend today , and you ' re going to stay here with grammy and grand ##dad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his tiny brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mace no go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] guilt rocket ##ed through her . [SEP]
[CLS] how could she spend one of her few off days away from her son ? [SEP]
[CLS] the doorbell rang , and she was forced out of her self - lo ##athing to answer the door . [SEP]
[CLS] taking a deep breath , she opened it . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart did a funny little flip - flop at the sight of pe ##sh on the porch . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t just how handsome he looked in his k ##hak ##i pants , red button - down polo shirt , and black blaze ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' she said shy ##ly , after they had stared at each other for a few seconds . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like to come in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he nodded , she stepped aside to give him room to come in the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned back to her and held out the roses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` these are for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after the words left his lips , he grimaced , as if what he had said offended him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bye - bye kiss , mommy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason called from the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled apologetic ##ally at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll just be one minute . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take your time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hurried across the foyer and into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] she deposited the roses onto one of the tables . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be back tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] you be a good boy , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , when she got to her father ' s chair . [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned over and kissed both of mason ' s cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give mommy a kiss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a smack ##ing kiss on the cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bye , my love , ' ' megan said , before turning and heading out of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d just reached pe ##sh ' s side when he glanced past her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we have a potential st ##owa ##way , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] she whirled around to see mason standing in the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong , baby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no go , ' ' he whimpered . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] he usually is fine about me leaving him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she knelt down beside mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t be gone long , and you ' ll have much more fun here with grammy and grand ##dad . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh and i are doing boring , big people stuff . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no go ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cried , as big tears poole ##d in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh knelt down beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey buddy , do n ' t cry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not going to take your mommy away from you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mace go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked hopefully . [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , sweetheart , i told you that we were going to do big people things today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s true , ' ' pe ##sh said . [SEP]
[CLS] then he smiled at mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but that does n ' t mean we ca n ' t take a little det ##our first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s widened her eyes in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we take mason to lunch at his favorite place ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t mean that , ' ' megan argued . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh cut his gaze over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i can adjust our reservations . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help staring at him in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] how was it possible he was so willing to change his plans simply because mason did n ' t want her to leave ? [SEP]
[CLS] she fought the urge to reach out and touch his shoulder to make sure he was real - he was far too good to be true at times . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course it ' s all right with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i was worried about it not being okay with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would n ' t have suggested it if i did n ' t mean it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out and ru ##ffled mason ' s hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right , buddy , where do you want to go for lunch ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cheese ! [SEP]
[CLS] cheese ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cried , as he bobbed up and down . [SEP]
[CLS] megan groaned as pe ##sh ' s expression grew confused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he wants to eat cheese ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he wants to go to chuck e . cheese - every parent ' s worst nightmare . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled as he rose up from the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right then . [SEP]
[CLS] chuck e . cheese it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go get your shoes , ' ' megan instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] as mason raced back into the living room , megan stood up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really do n ' t have to do this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly , i do n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] we can go have lunch with mason , and then we can start our date . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure he ' ll be worn out and ready for a nap when we get back , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] then he wo n ' t have any reason to miss you if he ' s asleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled at his thoughtful ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i really mean that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out and brushed her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to lean in to kiss her , mason ran back into the foyer with his shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh quickly jerked back . [SEP]
[CLS] to combat the awkward ##ness , megan bus ##ied herself with getting mason ' s shoes on . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finished , mason bounded over to pe ##sh and grabbed his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ! [SEP]
[CLS] go ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed at mason ' s enthusiasm . [SEP]
[CLS] he held his other hand out for megan . [SEP]
[CLS] she slid her hand into his and then they started to the car . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan walked through the doors of their local chuck e . cheese , she recoil ##ed slightly at both the ear - splinter ##ing noise and the stomach - turning smells . [SEP]
[CLS] she also fought her embarrassment at the looks she and pe ##sh were getting for their more formal outfits . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we ' re a little over ##dre ##ssed , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] he held up his index finger and thumb before pinch ##ing them close together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a little bit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tugging on pe ##sh ' s hand , mason dragged him over to the todd ##ler area of games . [SEP]
[CLS] megan quickly dug in her purse for some money for tickets . [SEP]
[CLS] after she bought them , she went over to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go grab us some pizza . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she waved the tickets at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` once these are gone , he ' s done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind getting him more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust me . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay then , ' ' he replied good - nature ##dly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan felt completely at ease leaving pe ##sh to watch mason . [SEP]
[CLS] she got them a couple of slices of mason ' s favorite , pepper ##oni , along with some drinks and then made her way over to a table close to the todd ##ler area . [SEP]
[CLS] when she caught pe ##sh ' s eye , she waved them over . [SEP]
[CLS] after several tense moments , he was finally able to convince mason to leave the play area to come and eat . [SEP]
[CLS] as mason bounced around in his seat , megan knew she would be doing good to get four bites of pizza down him before he was ra ##ring to go play again . [SEP]
[CLS] she also had a fear that she , pe ##sh , or the both of them were going to be wearing tomato sauce before it was all said and done . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this place is very interesting , ' ' pe ##sh remarked , as he gazed around . [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you never had the pleasure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sadly no . [SEP]
[CLS] my brother , ar ##jan ' s , and his children live in florida , so i ' ve really never had a reason to come . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve dodged a bullet there . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s for sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled before taking a bite of his pizza . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression turned so sour that megan could n ' t help giggling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is terrible , ' ' he muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should have warned you not to bother eating . [SEP]
[CLS] it only seems app ##eti ##zing to small children who are h ##ype ##d up on adrenaline . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a long sw ##ig from his coke and sw ##ished the liquid around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste . [SEP]
[CLS] when he caught mason looking at him , he put on a fake smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , that ' s good pizza . [SEP]
[CLS] you better eat yours before i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice save , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] he winked at her as he threw his napkin on his plate . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe when her heart fluttered at his gesture . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost impossible to believe that she could be getting feelings for him in the middle of chuck e . cheese . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` done . [SEP]
[CLS] go play , ' ' mason announced , bringing her out of her thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think so . [SEP]
[CLS] you need to eat more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason scowled at her before grabbing another bite and shovel ##ing it into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] he managed to clean his plate with a little coa ##xing from pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] then the two of them went back over to the play area . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan watched them , the small ache in her chest began to grow . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh was completely hands on , ho ##ist ##ing mason up where he could reach things and then catching him when he came off the slide . [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with mason . [SEP]
[CLS] some guys would have played with mason only to get on her good side . [SEP]
[CLS] but pe ##sh did n ' t have an agenda when it came to her , unless it was to have her embrace the idea of a relationship with him . [SEP]
[CLS] when the last ticket was spent , she rose off her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , time to go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason ' s face sc ##run ##ched up , and he looked like at any minute he might throw a tan ##trum to stay . [SEP]
[CLS] but pe ##sh took his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll come back another time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his reply seemed to pac ##ify mason , and he happily slung his and pe ##sh ' s arm back and forth as they walked to the car . [SEP]
[CLS] when they got buckled up , megan turned back to mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you say to pe ##sh for bringing you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tank you , es ##h , ' ' mason said . [SEP]
[CLS] his words sent a broad grin stretching across pe ##sh ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , buddy . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a good time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he glanced over at megan , she gave him a genuine smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had a good time , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking one of his hands off the steering wheel , he reached over to take her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] while the gesture was a little too love ##y - dove ##y for her liking , she did n ' t argue with him . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she just enjoyed his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] once they had deposited a sleepy mason back home at megan ' s , they abandoned her suv and gotten into pe ##sh ' s jaguar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so where exactly are we going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , as she buckled her seat belt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a surprise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re still playing co ##y about it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for just a little while longer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i try to guess ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure i ' d tell you even if you guess , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are we going to atlanta ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cut his gaze from the road over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have patience . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing her arms over her chest , she huffed , ` ` i do n ' t have patience for games . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i ' ll give you a little hint . [SEP]
[CLS] actually , it ' s more of a question than it is a hint . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have a fear of heights ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a sly grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a hint . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i went sky ##di ##ving when i turned twenty - one , so i ' m totally fine with heights . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , i seriously doubt we ' re going sky diving in these clothes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , we ' re not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wrinkled her nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please tell me it ' s not box seats at the opera or something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his face fell . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t like the opera ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never been and never want to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh appeared almost personally insulted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to have to change your mind on that one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why am i not surprised you like opera ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t knock it until you ' ve tried it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a bunch of sc ##ree ##ching men and women singing in a language i do n ' t understand ? [SEP]
[CLS] not my idea of a good time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but there is such love and passion in their delivery , ' ' he argued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , i ' m just going to have to agree to disagree with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for now at least , ' ' he said , with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] when the car started slowing down , megan peered out the windshield before turning to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re at mcc ##oll ##um ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re taking me flying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] even though she had known he had a plane from how he ' d helped get aidan to noah ' s delivery , she could n ' t believe their date included something as unique as flying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so let me get this straight . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m dressed like this , ' ' she did a little hand motion over her dress , ` ` to go flying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] an amused look twinkle ##d in his dark eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have absolutely no patience , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he put the car in park outside the hang ##er , he turned to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` by your lack of being able to with ##hold gr ##ati ##fication , i ' m assuming you ' ve never part ##ake ##n in any tan ##tric sex ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t stop her mouth from dropping to her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` w - what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stammered . [SEP]
[CLS] turning in his seat , he pinned her with a hard stare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have i managed to shock you again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] unable to speak , she merely bobbed her head . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh only chuckled at her response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s get going . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] still in shock , she remained rooted to her seat . [SEP]
[CLS] when he came around to open her door , she peered up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tan ##tric sex ? [SEP]
[CLS] like sting , tr ##udi ##e style ##r , and tan ##tric sex ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i suppose so , ' ' he replied , as he offered her his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##dina ##rily , she would n ' t have taken it , but at the declaration that pe ##sh was actually into something outside the sexual norms , she was too floor ##ed to argue with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t think you ' d like anything . . . kin ##ky . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s dark eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tan ##tric is n ' t kin ##ky . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s about connecting with your lover on a more intimate level . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s about breathing them in and truly being one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so it ' s not about marathon sex that lasts for days ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve gotten the more sal ##acious side confused with what it actually is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pursed her lips at him as her mind whirled with the possibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , if tan ##tric sex with pe ##sh was anywhere as good as his efforts in going down on her , she was one very lucky lady . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess you ' ll just have to educate me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they were interrupted by an air traffic controller with a heads ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , dr . nad ##een , how goes it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] everything ready to go , lewis ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , as he pumped the man ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gas ##sed up and checked out . [SEP]
[CLS] we just need your flight plan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s gaze went to megan before he said , ` ` we ' ll be flying into savannah / hilton head airport . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks , ' ' lewis replied , before he started back inside the hang ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re taking me to savannah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for dinner and dancing . [SEP]
[CLS] i had originally intended on more , but we got a later start . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re crazy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a puzzled look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t like savannah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i love it . [SEP]
[CLS] i just meant taking me four hours away for dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not that long by plane . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing her arms over her chest , she tilted her head at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could n ' t just take me somewhere fancy in atlanta ? [SEP]
[CLS] you have to fly me in your private plane to another city ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although it was probably una ##tt ##ractive , she could n ' t help snort ##ing with contempt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m probably going to sound a little like the line from pretty woman when she says she appreciate ##s the seduction scene , but she ' s a sure thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she patted her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am a sure thing . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to go to all this trouble . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his dark eyes narrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your way of thinking is precisely why i ' m doing what i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve only been with men who wanted a sure thing - men who did n ' t even bother trying to imagine a future with you past when they came at the end of the night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sucked in a breath at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] with his expression soft ##ening , he closed the gap between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` while you may only want sex from me , i want far more from you . [SEP]
[CLS] i want your time , but i also want you to understand that you ' re worthy of something special . [SEP]
[CLS] and if it takes planes and fancy meals to prove it to you , then i ' m going to do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after his argument , megan sat frozen in dumb ##founded silence . [SEP]
[CLS] how was it possible that he knew so much about her ? [SEP]
[CLS] he was right in the fact that she settled for being the ' sure thing ' for the guys she dated in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she did n ' t want to make those mistakes again , so why should n ' t she let him try to wine and din ##e her ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] take me to savannah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he opened the passenger side door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here you go . [SEP]
[CLS] make sure you buckle your seat belt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded before she dipped inside the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh waited for her to adjust her dress before he closed the door . [SEP]
[CLS] as he walked around the front of the plane , she got busy finding the seat belt and buck ##ling up . [SEP]
[CLS] once he climbed inside , he handed her a heads ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this will help with the cabin noise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s going to mess my hair up , ' ' she complained . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never took you as the type of woman who worried about her hair . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned as she eased the heads ##et on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you know . [SEP]
[CLS] i worry about my hair , and you get your freak on in the bedroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rolled his eyes at her and turned in his seat . [SEP]
[CLS] after placing his heads ##et on , he started flipping switches and turning knob ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the propeller on the front of the plane started w ##hir ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what kind of plane is this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked over the noise . [SEP]
[CLS] holding up a finger , he spoke into the mic on the heads ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ground to tower , this is cessna 172 requesting to taxi for takeoff . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly the sound of the tower came over her heads ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` clearance for taxi and takeoff , cessna 172 . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` roger that , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] the plane lurched forward and then started taxi ##ng down the runaway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , i ' m guessing a cessna 172 ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nice . [SEP]
[CLS] i like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you ' ll be saying that again in a minute . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan knew what he meant when the plane started gaining speed down the runaway . [SEP]
[CLS] just like when she was on a commercial flight , it was on the ground one minute , and then in the air the next . [SEP]
[CLS] they soared into the blue sky while zip ##ping through white , fluffy clouds . [SEP]
[CLS] once they had gained enough altitude , pe ##sh eased off on the rudder and glanced over at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you okay over there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you kidding me ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear you like it . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t know if you were going to take after your uncle aidan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear you gave him drugs to make it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i did . [SEP]
[CLS] he slept most of the way there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` total wu ##ss , ' ' she remarked with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] after adjusting one of the controls , pe ##sh said , ` ` well , i have to admit that my late wife was n ' t a fan , either . [SEP]
[CLS] she tolerated flying with me because she knew how much i loved it , but most of the time , she ' d take a pill to relax . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so she did n ' t share your passion ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , she did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she always encouraged me to do what i loved . [SEP]
[CLS] she never was one to make me choose between her or something else . [SEP]
[CLS] she was that sac ##ri ##fi ##cing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was really amazing of her to be that giving . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh remained silent , megan knew it was time for a conversation change . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now that i know we ' re going to savannah , are you going to tell me where we ' re going for dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' ll probably be a late lunch when we get there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , where will our late lunch be ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you like the historic district ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve picked a restaurant there for us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you come to savannah often ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a couple of times a year , mainly for medical conferences on the coast . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you always fly ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] the flight took less time than she thought , and with clear weather , it was totally smooth . [SEP]
[CLS] as they started making their descent , pe ##sh glanced over at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ready for the landing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] why would n ' t i be ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it can be a little intense for some people . [SEP]
[CLS] you see a lot more of the ground rushing at you than when you ' re in a 747 . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cocked her head at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i went sky ##di ##ving , remember ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , that ' s right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , he added , ` ` you ' re my little adrenaline junk ##ie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was . [SEP]
[CLS] not anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what changed all that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mason . [SEP]
[CLS] when you ' re responsible for the health , safety , and happiness of someone else , your entire perspective changes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s a true gift . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked her gaze to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh gave her a small smile before radio ##ing the tower . [SEP]
[CLS] once he had clearance to land , they started rapidly losing altitude . [SEP]
[CLS] the runway got closer and closer until the plane jolted forward and then began ski ##dding along the pavement . [SEP]
[CLS] when it finally came to a shuddering stop , megan exhaled the breath she ' d been holding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` still okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the sound of the tower came in her heads ##et as pe ##sh listened to the instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] the plane started rolling toward one of the hang ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] once he had parked and powered down the plane , he got out to help her . [SEP]
[CLS] after a quick talk with a member of the grounds crew , pe ##sh took her hand and led her out of the hang ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] a cab waited to take them into the city . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed as she slid across the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m surprised by the cab . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought you might really go upscale by having a limo or cha ##uf ##fe ##ur - driven car pick us up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like to stay humble , ' ' he replied with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head at him before turning to gaze out the window at the scenery . [SEP]
[CLS] when they began winding through the ant ##eb ##ell ##um homes of the historic district , megan felt her stomach growl . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been too nervous to eat breakfast , and then she had n ' t dared eat at chuck e . cheese ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the cab stopped outside a chi ##c looking restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh paid the driver , megan hopped out and took in the sights around her . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the old world feel of the city with all its history and charm . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh offered her his arm , and then they walked inside . [SEP]
[CLS] the restaurant ' s popularity was evident in how crowded it was even at four in the afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] they were ushered to a quiet , candle ##lit table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wine ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` white okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after the waiter left with their drink order , megan surveyed the menu and sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything looks so good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing over his menu at her , pe ##sh said , ` ` with the cuisine being southern , i imagined you would like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love all types of food . [SEP]
[CLS] trust me , as hungry as i am now , i would have eaten anywhere . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the waiter returned with their wine , and megan knew she needed to make a decision . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have the shrimp and grit ##s , please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` very good , ma ' am , ' ' the waiter replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have the same , ' ' pe ##sh said , handing the waiter his menu . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan grinned at him , his brows rose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just surprised to hear you eating something so southern as shrimp and grit ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ts ##ked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when will you learn that you can never pigeon ##hole me as one thing or the other ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , i like that you ' re proving me wrong and being unexpected . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sometimes i feel like people try to do the same thing to me . [SEP]
[CLS] people have their own assumptions about girls or women who get knocked up . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope i constantly prove them wrong . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure you do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after taking a sip of his wine , he cocked his head at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` prove me wrong on this one . [SEP]
[CLS] does a southern girl like you eat indian food ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes , i love it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his dark eyes lit up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s your favorite dish ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , i love butter chicken , but i ' m also a fan of pa ##v baha ##ji . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m impressed . [SEP]
[CLS] emma had never eaten any indian food , and i do n ' t think i made a good impression on her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s chuckle died out , and he immediately grimaced at the mention of emma ' s name . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that they were dancing around the white elephant in the room , megan reached across the table and patted his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay that you ' re talking about emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` speaking of old girlfriends or women you ' ve dated while you ' re with another woman is never a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is different . [SEP]
[CLS] emma is my family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she swirled the wine around in her glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve heard her side of the story , but i do n ' t think i ' ve heard yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you heard a little when you were in ##eb ##riated the night of noah ' s baptism . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] now it was megan ' s turn to grimace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i still would like to know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh drew in a ragged breath . [SEP]
[CLS] when the waiter appeared with their salad ##s , it appeared that he might dodge the question entirely . [SEP]
[CLS] but once they were alone together , he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma came along at a time when i was facing extreme pressure from family and friends to move on from my grief and date again . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no escape to it - i faced it at the hospital , as well as when i was at home . [SEP]
[CLS] people seemed to think that once a year went by on the calendar that meant i was through with my mourning . [SEP]
[CLS] then one day , there she was in the er . [SEP]
[CLS] she was scared out of her mind about your grandfather . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow i just connected with her through her grief and pain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he da ##bbed his mouth with his napkin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she reminded me so much of jade that it was easy to try to imagine that what i was feeling for her was romantic . [SEP]
[CLS] i had n ' t been out in so long that i wanted to woo her , just like i wanted to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and aidan came between you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in a way , both he and jade did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s just say , during a very heated moment together , she was with aidan , and i was with jade . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan was surprised by his can ##dor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there was one item in the pe ##sh and emma equation she had always wondered about . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t mind that she was pregnant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] shaking his head , pe ##sh replied , ` ` it just made her even more beautiful to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d been through so much death that i guess i was drawn to her because she had life growing within her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s really beautiful , ' ' megan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a mir ##th ##less laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one of my worst character faults is having a hero complex . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess it ' s one of the reasons i became a doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] i saw emma , and i wanted to save her . [SEP]
[CLS] when she had to go on bed rest , i wanted to be her knight in shining armor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` being a hero is not exactly a bad character trait . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is when you ca n ' t save someone , and you have to constantly live with the guilt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s heart ached at the pain on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] sensing she needed to light ##en the mood , she teased , ` ` i ' m glad to hear you actually have a bad character trait . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , you seemed a little too perfect to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a shadow of a smile played on his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did i mention i ' m a terrible sl ##ob ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ? [SEP]
[CLS] never , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes . [SEP]
[CLS] if i did n ' t have a housekeeper , i ' m pretty sure i might end up on world ' s nas ##ties ##t houses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i find that hard to believe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] i also have no athletic ability whatsoever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after chewing thoughtfully on her bite of salad , megan said , ` ` but you ' re built like a football player . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m built because i go to the gym to work off stress . [SEP]
[CLS] but if you put me on the field , i ' d be a serious disappointment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that does n ' t turn me off at all . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve had my fill of jock ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] although he was trying to be non ##chal ##ant about it , she knew he wanted to hear the full story . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dating jock ##s for me is poison , and when i did date one , i made sure to date the ones at the top of their game . [SEP]
[CLS] my first athlete ' s influence caused me to ruin my chances at medical school . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s horrible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , it is . [SEP]
[CLS] but what ' s worse is i did n ' t learn anything from my mistakes because i fell for another one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a rue ##ful smile , she added , ` ` at least i got mason out of that one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laced his fingers together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mason ' s father is a professional athlete ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he plays football for the falcons . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i ' m friends with the team ' s sports medicine doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] i could probably arrange something for him . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe a little icy hot in his cup ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the mischievous twinkle in pe ##sh ' s eyes , megan burst out laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can not believe , you of all people , suggested such a thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , pe ##sh replied , ` ` it ' s a harmless prank . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i realize that . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just i ca n ' t imagine someone like you would even think of doing something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to open his mouth to argue , she held up her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , i know . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t pigeon hole you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] their main course arrived , and megan could n ' t help digging into the wonderful aromatic food . [SEP]
[CLS] as they ate , the conversation came easily . [SEP]
[CLS] that was one of the things she liked most about pe ##sh - he was so easy to talk to . [SEP]
[CLS] because he was older , refined , and a doctor , she could have felt intimidated by him . [SEP]
[CLS] but he never made her feel that way . [SEP]
[CLS] he always seemed fascinated by every single thing she had to say , which was quite a change from most of the guys she dated . [SEP]
[CLS] they were usually half listening to her while glancing over her shoulder at the tv to get the latest score . [SEP]
[CLS] after they finished , the waiter took their plates . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dessert ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , as she downed the last of her wine . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded his head toward the small dance floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about a dance instead ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wrinkled her nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m really not much of a dancer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he arched his brows at her as if he knew she was lying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , fine , i used to dance all the time back in high school and college . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then dance with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not good at slow dancing . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll probably regret asking me the moment we get out there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh stuffed a wa ##d of bills into the bill envelope . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as shakespeare would say , the lady do protest ##h too much . [SEP]
[CLS] and i think i know the reason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` slow dancing is intimate , and you do n ' t want to want to let yourself be intimate with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you went down on me in a supply closet . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that ' s pretty intimate , ' ' she challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was not intimacy . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual acts are of the mind where our pleasure center is . [SEP]
[CLS] intimacy is of the heart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he held her gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we both know you ' ll let me into your body but not your heart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] knowing he was right , she crossed her arms over her chest and scowled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know why she just could n ' t get up and go dance like he had asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d slow danced a thousand times at parties . [SEP]
[CLS] what was the difference here ? [SEP]
[CLS] somewhere deep down , she knew the answer to that question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t want to dance , then let ' s go and see the city . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] not wanting to let him get the best of her , she rose out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll dance with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t sound so thrilled . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after he stood up , he took her hand and led her over to the dance floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she started to wrap her arms around his neck like she was accustomed to , but he put one of her hands on his shoulder and then he took the other hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] his other hand slid around to rest at her lower back . [SEP]
[CLS] the band finished the jazz ##ier beats of a song and then switched over to another . [SEP]
[CLS] a lone piano pounded out the opening chords . [SEP]
[CLS] the lead singer ' s sul ##try voice filled the air , ` ` like a flower waiting to bloom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan immediately recognized the song as nora ##h jones ' turn me on . [SEP]
[CLS] the electricity between them shifted , and as megan stared up into pe ##sh ' s eyes , she saw desire and lust fl ##aring in them . [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze dropped down to his full lips , and she could n ' t help wanting him to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] as if he read her mind , pe ##sh ' s mouth closed over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] darting her tongue out , she sought to find his warmth . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did , he tasted like a mixture of the wine and spices they ' d eaten . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue pulled back to trace her lips as his h * ps jerked , pushing him against her . [SEP]
[CLS] she followed his lead by pressing herself flush against him to where her br * * sts were rubbing against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] she shivered when he groaned into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb slid back and forth between her shoulder blades , and she could n ' t help arching into his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] as he pulled away from their kiss , he kept his eyes locked on hers . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never had a man stare at her so much . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul . [SEP]
[CLS] it both overwhelmed and in ##fl ##ame ##d her at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all part of his slow seduction plan , and it was working . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please take me somewhere - somewhere we can be alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his expression became pained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan - ' ' she brought her hand from his shoulder to cover his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t make me beg to be with you anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] shaking his head , he replied , ` ` i ca n ' t deny you anymore , not after having a taste of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shuddered at the intensity of both his words and the way he delivered them . [SEP]
[CLS] taking her by the hand , he led her off the dance floor . [SEP]
[CLS] they snake ##d around the tables in the dining area until they reached the exit . [SEP]
[CLS] weaving through the people , they went into the hotel that ad ##jo ##ined the restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] it was actually more of a historic bed and breakfast than a hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] as they neared the reception area , pe ##sh dropped her hand to reach into his coat pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] once he retrieved his wallet , he stepped up to the desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need a room please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` credit card and identification please , ' ' the inn keeper drone ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] as she sized him up , megan could n ' t help thinking he looked rather po ##mp ##ous - the usual type of person who worked in a high - end place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you prefer queen or - ' ' ` ` a king please , ' ' pe ##sh requested through clenched teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you need help with your luggage ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , we do n ' t have any . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the man typed something into the computer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and how long will you be staying with us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as long as we need , ' ' pe ##sh replied , drumming his fingers on the marble counter . [SEP]
[CLS] megan watched as the man ' s eyes widened and a flush entered his face . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly finished the reservation and handed pe ##sh a key card . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have you in one of our balcony king suites . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking her by the hand , pe ##sh led her over to the elevators . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan dared to glance over her shoulder , she saw the man peering curiously at them . [SEP]
[CLS] as they stepped onto the car , megan could n ' t help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh looked at her in surprise , she laughed even harder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` by the way that conversation went down , he probably thinks i ' m a prostitute . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t seriously think that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , maybe a high - end escort ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a growl came from low in his throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do not dem ##ean yourself like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not dem ##ean ##ing myself . [SEP]
[CLS] think about it . [SEP]
[CLS] we come in during the middle of the day with no luggage , and we want a hotel room with a king sized bed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tapped her chin with her finger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , what could we possibly be doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of his lips turned up in a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i probably should care what the man thinks , but right now , i frankly do n ' t give a shit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me either . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the elevator ding ##ed , signaling they had reached their floor . [SEP]
[CLS] they stepped out and read the signs to find their room . [SEP]
[CLS] once pe ##sh opened the door , megan walked inside . [SEP]
[CLS] she took in the cozy decor of the room with its brick fireplace , antiques , and four - poster bed . [SEP]
[CLS] going to a hotel could have been sl ##ea ##zy , but this room had such a romantic feel to it . [SEP]
[CLS] when he came up behind her and slid his arms around her waist , she could n ' t help suddenly feeling shy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his breath warmed against her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you tensed when i touched you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i ' m just nervous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh turned her around to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have anything to feel nervous about . [SEP]
[CLS] if you do n ' t want to do this anymore , we do n ' t have to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i want to do it , ' ' she assured him . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , his fingers went to her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] after he und ##id the clasp , her hair tumbled down over her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] an app ##re ##cia ##tive shudder rippled through her when he nu ##zzled his face into the strands at her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] from there he sought out the zipper at the middle of her back . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , he slid it down . [SEP]
[CLS] when the back of the dress gaped open , he took the spaghetti straps and eased them over her shoulders and down her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] megan felt his breath warming her back as the dress poole ##d onto the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped out of it , and then turned to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] the heat of his gaze stoke ##d the fire burning deep inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression was fierce as he drank in her strap ##less black bra and panties , along with her heels . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are so beautiful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , she felt the urge to blush at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] guys had told her she was beautiful before , but it did n ' t feel the same or sound the same coming from them as it did pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] the way he said she was beautiful , coupled with the way he looked at her , made her tingle in all the right places . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands came to his tie . [SEP]
[CLS] after she loosened it , she ripped it off him and slung it to the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] def ##tly , her fingers worked the buttons on his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] when she opened it , she sucked in a breath at the sight of the dustin ##g of dark hair covering his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] it trailed down over his wash ##board abs and down into his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pretty beautiful yourself , ' ' she said with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] as he shrugged off his shirt , her fingers went to his belt . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire time she un ##bu ##tton ##ed and un ##zi ##pped him , his burning gaze took in everything she did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do you keep staring at me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m afraid if i look away , you wo n ' t be real . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hand cupped her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve wanted this for so long - i ' ve wanted you for so long . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s hard to believe that you ' re really here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` touch me , ' ' she urged . [SEP]
[CLS] she took his other hand and brought it to her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` touch me and feel how real i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lowering his head , his mouth hovered over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` breathe me in , ' ' he instructed , as he kn ##ead ##ed her breast over her bra . [SEP]
[CLS] at the feel of his breath against her lips , she inhaled while his heated gaze almost sing ##ed her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] even if she had wanted to , she could n ' t bring herself to look away from his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] when she exhaled , he inhaled , and it was like they were doing a dance . [SEP]
[CLS] it was both relaxing and somewhat erotic . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never spent time just breathing and gazing into someone ' s eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you ' ve had your first lesson in tan ##tra , ' ' he murmured against her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked her head back to stare at him in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to do more ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached around to undo her bra . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want me to ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i will . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to do whatever is pleasing for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him . [SEP]
[CLS] he eased her over to the four - poster bed . [SEP]
[CLS] after removing his pants and boxers , he slid her panties down her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan sat on the edge of the massive king sized bed , she widened her legs to allow him to step between them . [SEP]
[CLS] when he brought his hand to stroke between her thighs , she moaned and let her head fall back . [SEP]
[CLS] two fingers entered her and began a slow , teasing assault . [SEP]
[CLS] she began to rock her h * ps against his hand , adding the friction she desired . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt his erection rubbing against her leg , she reached between them to take him in her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyelids fluttered open , and she stared into his face as they worked each other into a sweaty , panting frenzy . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh curled his fingers inside her , she bit down on her lip to keep from screaming out in pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] her orgasm rocket ##ed through her lower half , causing her head to fall forward onto his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came back to herself , pe ##sh was sliding her body up the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] then he was hovering over her , kissing her br * * sts and licking her ni * * les into hardened peaks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now , pe ##sh , ' ' she urged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you deep inside of me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] just as his head nudged against her opening , he stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no , ' ' he murmured before rocking back to sit on his knees . [SEP]
[CLS] megan propped herself up on her elbows and gazed up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hoped that after giving in , he had n ' t decided to back out at the last minute . [SEP]
[CLS] he rubbed the stubble on his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i , uh . . . we ca n ' t do this without a condom , and i do n ' t have one with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] in the heat of the moment , she had totally forgotten about that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t happen to have one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked hopefully . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s me who ought to be sorry for putting you in a position like this without protection . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to pull away , she sat up to grab his shoulders , urging him to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we can still do this . [SEP]
[CLS] neither one of us has been with anybody in at least two years - we ' ve had tests for the hospital . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s all well and good but what about pregnancy ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you on the pill ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she chewed on her bottom lip momentarily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait a minute , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] in her mind , she began counting down the days since her last period . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` twenty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` twenty what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m on day twenty , so we should be safe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll still pull out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you say so , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] gripping his biceps , she urged him to cover her again with his body . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the feel of his chest hairs rubbing against her ni * * les . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh widened her legs , and then he eased inside her , filling and stretching her walls . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been so long that she could n ' t help feeling a bit of a sting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he withdrew and flexed his hips , thrusting back inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] this time they both moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] setting up a rhythm , he began rocking in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] the pace was slow and sensual , and while he was hitting all the right spots , she wanted more . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire time he moved in and out of her , he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers . [SEP]
[CLS] his gaze was so dark with desire that she did n ' t dare look away . [SEP]
[CLS] the longer she stared into his eyes , the more connected with him she felt . [SEP]
[CLS] the old saying was that the eyes were windows to the soul , and she was getting a pretty good glimpse into his . [SEP]
[CLS] and that scared the hell out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] wanting to make things less sensual , she gripped his biceps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` harder , ' ' she panted . [SEP]
[CLS] rising on his knees , he slid his forearms under the backs of her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] this enabled him to pull her back against his pounding thrusts . [SEP]
[CLS] while their connection at first had been so intimate , this was more about lust and desire . [SEP]
[CLS] she reached up and clasped his face in her hands , bringing his head down to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] their mouths and tongues met in fr ##en ##zie ##d kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled out of her , megan whimpered at the loss of feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly flipped her over onto her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling on her hips , he raised her up onto her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] when he re ##enter ##ed her , megan moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] with each thrust , he went deeper and deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers fisted the sheets as he leaned over her back , kissing a trail down her spine . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know how he was able to be so many places at once . [SEP]
[CLS] while his mouth licked her back and teasing ##ly left love bites , his hands were rubbing her thighs and then sliding under her to squeeze her br * * sts or tease her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] he was giving her so much that she could n ' t stay silent . [SEP]
[CLS] she moaned , chant ##ed his name , and cried out as the sounds of their wet skin slapped together . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she could n ' t take it anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] dropping her head , she screamed into the mattress as she found her release . [SEP]
[CLS] once her walls finished clenching , she felt pe ##sh withdraw from her . [SEP]
[CLS] as he groaned , megan felt warmth spur ##t onto her back and bu * * o ##cks . [SEP]
[CLS] after seeing him come before , she hated she could n ' t see his face . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so beautiful when he was finding release . [SEP]
[CLS] once he finished , she eased down onto her stomach and curled a pillow under her head . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few seconds , pe ##sh lay down beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned her head and met his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] exhausted and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life , all she could muster to say was , ` ` wow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a slow grin spread across his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you seem to say that a lot around me after orgasm ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s because you render me absolutely speechless with your talents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i could say the same about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his gaze left her face and trailed down her na * * d back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we need to get you cleaned up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rolling her shoulder blades , she said , ` ` i kinda like it . [SEP]
[CLS] makes me feel marked or something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled shy ##ly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the idea of marking you - making you mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her to be his . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know quite what to think about that statement . [SEP]
[CLS] did she want to be his ? [SEP]
[CLS] she certainly could n ' t imagine belonging to anyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the amazing physical chemistry they shared , she was starting to feel such a deep connection to him . [SEP]
[CLS] staring over at him , she could n ' t help wondering what was going on in his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ve really done it now , have n ' t we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i do believe that was the universal ` ` it ' ' that we just did , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] she smacked his arm playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not what i meant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no matter what , this changes everything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for the better , i hope . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the truth was she ' d never really had casual sex before . [SEP]
[CLS] there was one time her freshman year that she hooked up with a guy at work . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first and only time she ' d ever done anything so crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] in that instance , the sex had been over before she ' d known it and without her coming even once . [SEP]
[CLS] after that fia ##sco , she had never wanted a repeat performance with him or any other random guy , until she ' d found herself in a sex slump after mason ' s birth . [SEP]
[CLS] but with pe ##sh , the sex had been . . . she shivered as the remaining echoes washed over her . [SEP]
[CLS] before sleeping with pe ##sh , she could count the number of past sexual partners on one hand , as well as the times she had had even remotely good sex . [SEP]
[CLS] for megan , her experience with pe ##sh was seriously earth shattering and life altering . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t imagine just walking away now . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh sat up and edged to the side of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he held out his hand to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s shower . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you insist . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she slid over to him before throwing a leg over the side of the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] although she should have felt a little bash ##ful being na * * d in front of him , she felt surprisingly comfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] when she got into the bathroom , she raised her brows in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a claw ##foot tub ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all the old charm but modern convenience ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed to the det ##ach ##able shower head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned on the water and waited for it to heat up . [SEP]
[CLS] once he decided it was warm enough , he took her by the hand and helped her inside . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned her back to the spray , letting the water clean her up . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh did n ' t seem to think that was enough because after he soap ##ed up his hands , he began to wash off her back and ass . [SEP]
[CLS] as his magic hands massage ##d in slow strokes , she could n ' t resist asking the question that was pl ##ag ##uing her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did i feel different ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hands stilled on her lower back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at him over her shoulder , she replied , ` ` that was the first time i ' ve had sex since i gave birth to mason . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wondered if i felt different . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , inside . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his face came to nu ##zzle her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you felt amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not any different ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you hear me complaining ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , but i just worried . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have nothing to worry about , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hand skimmed over her rib ##ca ##ge to cup her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] as her nipple hardened beneath his fingers , she sucked in a pleased breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want nothing more than to be back inside you as soon as i can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then why do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine then . [SEP]
[CLS] put your hands on the tile , ' ' he ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , sir , ' ' she teased before placing her palms on the cool , wet tile . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh slid the gleaming silver shower head between her legs , causing her to gasp at the contact . [SEP]
[CLS] then he flicked his wrist to the side , sending the jets of water pounding into her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] she moaned and threw her head back against his drenched chest . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly he started moving the shower head to where it would rub against her . [SEP]
[CLS] each time she moved back , the water hit her in just the right spot . [SEP]
[CLS] she arched her h * ps as the pressure began to build . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh slid his free hand up over her rib ##ca ##ge to cup her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] he kn ##ead ##ed the flesh , pinch ##ing the ni * * les that were already hardened . [SEP]
[CLS] she pinched her eyes shut from the sensory over ##load . [SEP]
[CLS] just as she would feel herself about to come , he would shift his wrist so the vibrations hit her in another area , building her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , pe ##sh , ' ' she moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what , baby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please make me come . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you had enough pleasure yet , or should we continue on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , moving the shower head away from her . [SEP]
[CLS] she groaned at the loss . [SEP]
[CLS] rubbing her ass against his hardened erection , she begged , ` ` you let me come , and then i ' ll make sure you do as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with his knee , he nudged her legs even further apart . [SEP]
[CLS] when he once again brought the shower head between her legs , it reached even more sensitive areas . [SEP]
[CLS] it took only a few seconds of the water coupled with his rubbing and her grinding to cause her to scream with the pulsing con ##vu ##ls ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] she smacked her hands against the walls as wave after wave pulsed through her . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally stopped shuddering , she slowly slid around to smile up at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] she teasing ##ly pinched his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was going to say exquisite ##ly amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure you were . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] reaching between them , she took his erection in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good thing i ' m about to get on my knees because i do n ' t think i could stand after all that , ' ' she said , with a teasing wink . [SEP]
[CLS] bending her head , she began trailing kisses down his wet chest . [SEP]
[CLS] as she stroked him , she took time to kiss and then suck on his ni * * les . [SEP]
[CLS] his groan told her she was finding some of his most sensitive places . [SEP]
[CLS] after teasing his ni * * les to erect points , she continued on down his delicious wash ##board abs and through the dark hair that crowned his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] sinking down onto the floor of the tub , she stroked him hard from base to tip . [SEP]
[CLS] when his chest began to he ##ave , she leaned over to slide him into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , ' ' he groaned , his fingers coming to tangle in the wet strands of her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] she took him as far back as she could before sliding him out . [SEP]
[CLS] her tongue flicked over the sensitive head before she su ##ction ##ed it . [SEP]
[CLS] when she released him again , she began long lick ##s up his length . [SEP]
[CLS] then she once again slid him in her mouth and began bob ##bing her head up and down his length . [SEP]
[CLS] his groans began to echo throughout the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , megan , ' ' pe ##sh murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] his grip on her hair tightened as he flexed his h * ps to go even deeper into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] when he started tightening up , he tried to pull away , but she gripped his thighs and held him in place . [SEP]
[CLS] he cried out and then came in a rush into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] she swallowed all of him before she glanced up to see him staring down at her with such ad ##oration in his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he fell free from her mouth , she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he helped her up off the tub floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we better hurry up before we use all the hot water in these old pipes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you would probably do a good job keeping me warm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel the same way about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although they were tempted for another round , megan knew pe ##sh did n ' t want to chance it without any condoms . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she tore herself away from him when they finished their shower . [SEP]
[CLS] she blew her hair dry while he got dressed . [SEP]
[CLS] once she finished , he helped her slide back into her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] then they left their suite without even turning down the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] when they got downstairs , megan inwardly groaned that the same man was at the reception desk . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew from his expression that he recognized them as well . [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh handed him the key card , megan decided to make the most of the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] she rubbed pe ##sh ' s arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks again , mr . nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] make sure to call me again next time you ' re in savannah . [SEP]
[CLS] i love big spend ##ers like you , ' ' she pu ##rred . [SEP]
[CLS] while the man ' s eyes bulge ##d , pe ##sh stared at megan like she had grown another head . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water , but no words of ad ##mon ##ishment came out . [SEP]
[CLS] when he finally , recovered , he ter ##sel ##y replied , ` ` i ' ll try to remember that , miss mckenzie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] truly playing her part , megan turned on her heels and started walking across the lobby . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t get far before pe ##sh was at her side . [SEP]
[CLS] after shoving the hotel bill into his suit pocket , he slid his arm around her waist , drawing her close against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are in so much trouble , ' ' he growled into her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled as they walked out of the hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , are you going to punish me by taking me over your knee and span ##king me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just might , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head , she eyed him in the street lights . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t seriously expect me to believe that you of all people are into b ##ds ##m ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` once again , that does n ' t surprise me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he stopped walking right in the middle of the crowded street , she stared up at him in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a good span ##king , some handcuffs , and a blind ##fold all have possibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as all that other stuff ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb came up to trail slowly across her bottom lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if one truly knows how to f * * k , you do n ' t need any accessories and em ##bell ##ishment ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she licked her lips as a little shiver went down her spine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you certainly know what you ' re doing . [SEP]
[CLS] you just got me wet right here in the middle of the street . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his jaw clenched as he took her by the arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t say anything else like that . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to get you home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to your bed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish . [SEP]
[CLS] but you need to go home to your family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan did n ' t argue with him because she knew he was right . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a son to think about . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of how tempting it was , she just could n ' t go on some pleasure bing ##e when she was a mother . [SEP]
[CLS] but there was a part of megan that did n ' t want the bubble to burst by leaving pe ##sh and going home to her regular life . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted nothing more than go back to his place . [SEP]
[CLS] sex with pe ##sh had been phenomena ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] and despite being a little sore from under ##use , she certainly felt ready for more . [SEP]
[CLS] sex , that was . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh grabbed them a taxi , and they made the drive back to the airport . [SEP]
[CLS] even though they did n ' t speak , megan did n ' t feel awkward around him after what they had done . [SEP]
[CLS] he sat as close to her as he could with her hand clasped in his . [SEP]
[CLS] once they got back to the plane , she felt exhaustion begin to set in . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning back against the head ##rest , she closed her eyes as pe ##sh went about getting them ready to take off . [SEP]
[CLS] she only opened her eyes again when she felt them start racing down the runway . [SEP]
[CLS] when they got into the air , she could n ' t help sitting on the edge of her seat and peering out the windows at the city lights . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so beautiful in the dark . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sometimes i think i favor flying at night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for some reason , it seems much more tran ##quil . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a vulnerability to it as well . [SEP]
[CLS] in the day , everything is within your sight distance . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the dark , you have to rely on your instruments and instincts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d love to learn how to fly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you would ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve always thought it would be something amazing to learn . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i ' ll teach you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to him in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a shrug , she replied , ` ` you ' re a busy man , and i do n ' t know how fast a learn ##er i would be . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for you i would make time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she stared at him across the small interior of the plane , she knew she was ready to make more time for him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] where it would lead them , she could n ' t wait to see . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fifteen as the corn ##flower - blue horizon spread out for miles and miles before her , megan could n ' t help fighting the urge to pinch herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she was actually up in pe ##sh ' s plane during her first flight lesson . [SEP]
[CLS] from the moment they had taken off , she had been overwhelmed by such a surreal feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] it must ' ve been something about being in control of the plane as it rocket ##ed down the runway and then took off into the sky . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , she really was n ' t in total control of the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh was able to take over at any moment from his spot in the co - pilot ' s seat . [SEP]
[CLS] that made her feel a little better considering she had so little flying experience , and the manual she had read at least twice did n ' t prepare you for everything . [SEP]
[CLS] now as they coast ##ed along the city skyline , she kept both hands firmly gripping the steering wheel , or yo ##ke as it was called in small plane terminology , as they passed through wi ##sp ##y strands of white clouds . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh had first offered to give her flying lessons , megan did n ' t know if she should believe him or not . [SEP]
[CLS] looking back , she was n ' t sure why she ever doubted him considering he was always a man of his word . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , just two weeks after their first date in savannah , they were back up in the air flying around atlanta on a thursday afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been quite a week together of having dinner after work or them picking up something on the way to her house . [SEP]
[CLS] although , the first day back at work proved both difficult and awkward as they tried to appear as though nothing had changed . [SEP]
[CLS] but the fact was everything had changed , and it was n ' t just because they had become physical . [SEP]
[CLS] as much as megan tried to fight her growing feelings for pe ##sh , it was virtually impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] a man like him made it too hard for any woman not to fall in love with him , and as much as she did n ' t want to acknowledge it , she could see herself falling for him . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , he was also full of surprises . [SEP]
[CLS] like on monday when he had asked her to see if there was an extra heart monitor in one of the empty patient rooms on the first floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she had obe ##die ##ntly gone to check . [SEP]
[CLS] while she found the heart monitor , she also found him . [SEP]
[CLS] the gentleman she had once known became somewhat of a sex fi ##end when he locked the door and disappeared with her behind the curtain . [SEP]
[CLS] a mid - day sex session in an empty hospital bed made for quite an experience , especially when the brake on the bed released , and they literally banged into the walls . [SEP]
[CLS] but besides the naughty sex ##cap ##ade , he ' d wanted to spend down time with her and mason . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier in the week , pe ##sh brought mason to see his plane . [SEP]
[CLS] megan had to smile at the image in her mind of mason on pe ##sh ' s lap in the pilot ' s seat as he explained the ins and outs of the buttons and knob ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh had shown such patience with mason by constantly fielding his questions and letting him wear one of the heads ##ets . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d even gotten the at ##c to send a message over the heads ##et so mason could hear . [SEP]
[CLS] while it was supposed to be a pre - flying lesson for her , it turned educational for mason as well . [SEP]
[CLS] and to make it a day that neither mason , nor pe ##sh would forget , they ' d gone by mcdonald ' s afterwards so mason could play on the playground . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that pe ##sh was so willing to do anything to make mason happy was slowly starting to crack megan ' s tough resolve against dating him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t just the fact that pe ##sh was so wonderful with mason that had her reeling . [SEP]
[CLS] when they talked , she shared more with him than she ever had with a man . [SEP]
[CLS] he made it easy to open up to and speak of both the good and the bad in her life . [SEP]
[CLS] he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just rattling on and boring him . [SEP]
[CLS] he truly seemed interested in everything she said . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an amazing feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` still doing okay over there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , bringing her out of her thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish you could see your face , ' ' he mused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do i have some do ##pe ##y expression ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is n ' t do ##pe ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s wide - eyed wonder ##ment like a kid on christmas morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i would totally believe it since this certainly feels like a very big and very dangerous toy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a wonderful sight to see . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so glad i get to share this with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took one of her hands from the yo ##ke and brought it to his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] as his lips kissed over her knuckles , she tensed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need my hand back . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you said i should , ' ' she protested . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh sighed and released her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how i regret telling you that tip now , ' ' he lame ##nted . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not fair to try and distract me . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to focus , so we do n ' t crash . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll keep my hands to myself . . . for now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a shudder went through her at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment if there was any way possible to actually fly the plane and bang him , she would have tried . [SEP]
[CLS] shaking her head , she tried rid ##ding herself of her inappropriate thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , pointing at a dark b ##lip far down on the horizon . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh leaned forward in his seat , peering out the windshield . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks like a storm cloud moving in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should head back then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think it ' s going to affect us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , i do n ' t like the thought of trying to fly in a storm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then we ' ll head back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which way should i turn the plane ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s take a right , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] megan bobbed her head and then turned the yo ##ke at the same time she pressed on the right rudder pedal with her foot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] keep it coming . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re almost turned around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] once they were facing the opposite direction , pe ##sh said , ` ` now let ' s bring up the speed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did as she was told and waited for him to give her any further instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re good to go now . [SEP]
[CLS] when we ' re about ten minutes out from mcc ##oll ##um , you need to let the at ##c know we ' re coming in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i can do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have plans for this evening ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not that i know of . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like to have dinner with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ni ##bbled on her bottom lip to keep from laughing at his formal ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose so . [SEP]
[CLS] do i get dessert afterwards ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his body tensed beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you implying that i ' m dessert , or that after we finish dinner i should get you dessert ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i want you for dessert . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you can have me . [SEP]
[CLS] always . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing over at him , she said , ` ` i might have to ask for a to - go box since i ' m assuming we ' ll have mason with us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i enjoy spending time with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t keep the smile off her face at pe ##sh ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he really likes being with you , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never seen him warm up to a stranger as much as he has to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m a like ##able guy , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , you are , ' ' she murmured , trying not to let the out - of - control fluttering of her heart make her think more than she should about him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh interrupted her thoughts by motion ##ing to the controls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ahead and start doing your landing checks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan vaguely remembered what knob ##s and meters she had looked at before they took off . [SEP]
[CLS] once she got through the landing checks with pe ##sh ' s help , they were getting closer to mcc ##oll ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now radio at ##c . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , okay , ' ' megan replied , ni ##bbling on her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] after clearing his throat , megan glanced over at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] he motioned to the yo ##ke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , du ##h , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] with her thumb , she pressed the push - to - talk button . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is cessna 172 coming in for landing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she could ask pe ##sh if she had done it right , he relay ##ed a different message over his push - to - talk . [SEP]
[CLS] the at ##c ' s response crack ##led over her heads ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cessna 172 , this is ground control confirming you are clear to land . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now push on the yo ##ke to start the descent , ' ' pe ##sh instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] after she did what she was told , her eyes locked on the speed ##ometer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` should we be picking up this much speed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes and no , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell does that mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , jerking her wild gaze to his . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see the black knob there labeled ' throttle ' ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look at it this way . [SEP]
[CLS] you know when you ' re in a car and you ' re going downhill , you pick up speed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s the same thing in a plane . [SEP]
[CLS] but if you pull on the throttle knob , it reduces the engine power so there wo n ' t be an increase in speed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with her fingers grasping the black knob , megan asked , ` ` how hard do i need to pull on it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` try pulling back half - way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after pulling on the knob , megan eyed the speed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re slowing down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are we at ninety knots ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan glanced down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , then lower the nose just a little bit . [SEP]
[CLS] that will give us a glide - path or a controlled descent . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan eased on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane dipped below the horizon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now put the landing gear in the down position , ' ' pe ##sh instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that the button with the little tire on it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , that ' s the one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan pressed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` using the steering wheel , roll the wings a little to the right , so we ' re lined back up with the runway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan turned the steering wheel to the right a little too abruptly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##ops , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] just level it out . [SEP]
[CLS] you always want your runway target spot to stay in the same fixed spot on the windshield . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan stared ahead , she realized how close they were getting to the runway , and in turn , the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly she was n ' t so sure if she could land the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] it was one thing taking off , but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when landing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u - uh , p - pe ##sh , ' ' she stammered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked casually . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i can do this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cut her eyes over to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t land the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s too scary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head furiously back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no really . [SEP]
[CLS] you need to take back the controls . [SEP]
[CLS] i could cause us to crash . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i have faith in you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t let you do this if i did n ' t think you could . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stole a glance at him , taking in his earnest expression . [SEP]
[CLS] god , he really and truly believed in her . [SEP]
[CLS] and it was n ' t just about the fact they were banging each other every chance they got alone . [SEP]
[CLS] no , he saw through to the real her . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking a deep breath , she felt herself slowly calming down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll try , but i ' m not making any promises . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s my girl , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what should i do now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right , now you need to pull the throttle all the way out as well as pulling back on the wheel to keep the nose from dipping . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] clearing her throat that felt as dry as sand ##paper , megan jerked on the throttle button before pulling on the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a little harder considering how sweaty her hands were . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` keep it steady . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re doing great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as they came closer and closer to the runway , megan fought the urge to close her eyes , but she realized that would not be the right thing to do . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she braced herself for the impact . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment the wheels hit the asphalt she shrieked and clutched at the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t fight the bounce . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they ski ##dded along the pavement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , now ease up on the wheel and push on the tops of both pedal ##s to apply the brakes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without thinking , megan stomped her feet , causing the plane to sc ##ree ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` easy , ' ' pe ##sh said . [SEP]
[CLS] she let her feet off the brakes , and they began to coast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you ' re going to bring it back into the hang ##er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , hell no ! [SEP]
[CLS] i would end up mo ##wing out the side of the building or another plane ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cried . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s amused chuckle died quickly at the death glare she shot him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , you ' ll do fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you just landed a plane . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you can handle pulling into a hang ##er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she scowled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] but when you have to file a huge insurance claim , i ' m going to say ' i told you so . ' ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll see , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she could tell he was fighting back a smile the way he kept biting down on his lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right , take a right here , ' ' he said , pointing to where the runaway split . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned the wheel to the right and began easing her foot down on the brake when she saw the hang ##ers come into view . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which one is yours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i share the third one . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily for you , it ' s pretty much a straight shot in . [SEP]
[CLS] just watch out for my dad ' s plane . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan jerked her horrified gaze over to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could be taking out your dad ' s plane ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not going to take out anyone ' s plane , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] i have faith in you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gripped the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking a deep breath and giving herself a mental pep talk , she started slowly easing the plane inside the hang ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she was far away from the back wall , she hit the brakes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks good to me . [SEP]
[CLS] now you want to pull on the red knob . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the one that says mixture ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , that ' s the one . [SEP]
[CLS] it will kill the engine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when megan pulled on the knob , the plane shuddered into silence . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help sitting absolutely frozen for a few moments , processing everything that had happened . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s hand reached out to rub her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you okay over there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] turning her head , she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were starting to worry me for a minute . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i was worrying myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s warm laugh made her tingle in parts it should n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] with the adrenaline de ##ple ##ting from her system , she knew exactly what she wanted to do . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe the more appropriate word was who she wanted to do . [SEP]
[CLS] frantically , she un ##bu ##tton ##ed her seat belt and dove over into his lap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , what in the hell are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] her response to his question was to kiss him . [SEP]
[CLS] greed ##ily her mouth dev ##oured his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] as her tongue thrust into his mouth , her hand went between them to cup his growing erection . [SEP]
[CLS] he groaned while she worked him over his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] when she rose up on her knees to get a better grip of him , she banged her head against the ceiling of the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , bringing his hands up to cup her now aching head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he s ##nick ##ered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the last thing you need is a concussion . [SEP]
[CLS] how would we explain that one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe turbulence during the flight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the one creating turbulence , ' ' he replied , a wicked gleam in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are we going to do this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` backseat , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] with a nod , she began climbing over him into the small two seats in the back . [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh un ##buck ##led his seat belt , megan ' s fingers furiously worked to get her jeans un ##zi ##pped and un ##bu ##tton ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] she was easing them down her thighs when his body came over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] she once again claimed his mouth as pe ##sh worked to get his own pants down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] condom , ' ' he murmured against her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded and then reached her hand down to dig out the foil wrap ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] during high school , she gotten used to ha * * ng s * x in cars , but this was taking it to a whole new level . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow without being able to see him in the small confines of the plane ' s backseat , she rolled the condom down pe ##sh ' s length . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt his hardness pressing against her core , she widened her legs as far as she could in the cramped quarters . [SEP]
[CLS] with one quick thrust , he was buried deep inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she gripped his shoulders , pushing against him to keep from knocking back into the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] considering where they were , there was no time for soft and sweet . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the sounds in the air were of skin slapping together as pe ##sh ' s movements were frantic against her . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved every delicious minute of it , and it was n ' t too long before she felt herself going over the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] her nails raked over his back as she screamed his name . [SEP]
[CLS] with her walls milk ##ing pe ##sh ' s erection , he came with a shout , crushing her body with his . [SEP]
[CLS] just when she thought she could n ' t breathe , he jerked back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she cupped his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really good now , thanks to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her the shy smile of his that warmed her all over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] someone called outside the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh shit , ' ' he muttered , as he slid out of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] as he went about rid ##ding himself of the condom and jerking his pants up , he called , ` ` yeah , trace ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was just concerned about you considering you landed a few minutes ago and had n ' t de ##plane ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] and then there was a lot of knocking going on inside the plane . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s hand flew over her mouth as she started giggling un ##con ##tro ##lla ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] it probably did n ' t help that as trace was talking , she had noticed that the windows of the plane were fog ##ged up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i appreciate your concern , trace . [SEP]
[CLS] i was just checking on some post - flight issues . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be out in just a moment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh finished and climbed into the front seat , megan hurried to get her jeans up . [SEP]
[CLS] once she had them button ##ed and zip ##ped , she smoothed down her hair that had to look like she had just been f * * ked against an airplane seat . [SEP]
[CLS] she slid into the passenger seat to find that pe ##sh had opened the driver ' s side and was talking to trace . [SEP]
[CLS] trace ' s gaze left pe ##sh ' s and came to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had actually been going on . [SEP]
[CLS] he slowly started backing away from the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , you two have a nice day then , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` same to you , ' ' megan called , trying not to start giggling again . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head as he hopped down out of the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s go before we get in any more trouble . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but getting in trouble is so much fun , ' ' megan protested , as she opened her door . [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned at her as he came around to meet her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you , my lovely , are a very bad influence . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he wrapped his arms around her waist , drawing her close to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' m grateful for every moment i have with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , you know just how to flat ##ter a girl , ' ' she said , before kissing him . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few heated moments , pe ##sh pulled away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` considering this hang ##er has security cameras , let ' s not totally give them all our secrets today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan squealed and covered her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did they . . . can they . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not inside the backseat . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she exhaled with relief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank goodness . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , little trouble ##maker . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s go get something to eat . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , she added , ` ` especially if there ' s dessert ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter sixteen a few days after her flying adventure and partial induction in the mile high club , megan had started to take a few scripts to the pharmacy when she was yanked by the arm and dragged into an examining room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she began , as the door was slammed behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of pe ##sh before her , it was kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to have a word with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] anxiety bubble ##d in megan ' s chest , and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have i done something wrong with a patient ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no , this has everything to do with dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s brows shot up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh ? [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s wrong with him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not what is wrong with him . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s what is wrong with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan gulped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really like you , megan , but i am worried that you are just playing him . [SEP]
[CLS] it is cruel . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t deserve it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know what you mean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t play co ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] not only do i have two daughters around your age , but i ' ve spent enough time working with women to have a pretty good insight into the female mind . [SEP]
[CLS] so , i ' ll ask once again , what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan sq ##ui ##rmed under the heat of kris ##ti ' s stare . [SEP]
[CLS] if anyone found out that she and pe ##sh were hook ##ing up , it could be very bad for her nursing career . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re friends . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s my cousin ' s godfather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] let me speak as freely as i can since you insist on playing dumb . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t give two shit ##s if you and pe ##sh are screwing all over this hospital - ' ' megan was unable to contain her loud gasp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , but i - ' ' now it was kris ##ti ' s turn to interrupt . [SEP]
[CLS] she held up her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me finish please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' megan muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i realize that deep down he ' s just a man , and after going a long time without sex , it was probably a little easier for him to give in to just a causal relationship with you . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' ve worked by his side for seven years , so i have a pretty good handle on what he ' s truly feeling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan countered , unable to stop herself from being s ##nar ##ky . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i do . [SEP]
[CLS] that man loves you with every fiber of his being . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] those words caused megan ' s steel ##y resolve to fade . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help staggering a bit on her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that pe ##sh liked her - i mean , any fool could see that . [SEP]
[CLS] but love ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` h - he does ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah , he does . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s been holding a candle for you since the moment you walked in here . [SEP]
[CLS] i saw it the first day i introduced you two . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know what has happened since that day , but i know something has changed for you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s true that i care about him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s the most amazing man i ' ve ever known . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what the hell is the problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish i could tell you , but i do n ' t even know myself , ' ' megan moaned as tears stung her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dammit , stupid pm ##s hormones . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh honey , you do actually care about him , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re a wreck about what you ' re feeling for him , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t hold back the sobs any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] they rolled through her , causing her to bend at the waist under the burden . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti stepped forward , wrapping her arms around megan . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she knew she should try to fight her emotions considering she was at work , she decided to let herself go and get it all out . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally had a hold of herself , she raised her head , wiping what she imagined were the hideous black mascara streaks off her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] that was so un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al of me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti gave her a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you stop that , please ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is n ' t an evaluation . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i ' m the one who pulled you in here and provoked you . [SEP]
[CLS] you always keep your emotions in check out on the floor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the truth is i do care for pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] how could i not ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just not sure i ' m the right woman for him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but if he loves you , how could you think you ' re not the right one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan blurted out all the reasons she ' d previously given pe ##sh about her age and her lack of wanting a committed relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally finished un ##bu ##rden ##ing herself of all her doubts and fears , she glanced up at kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no judgment in her eyes or anger for that matter . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she merely patted megan ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh honey , you ' ve got to tune all those negative voices out and go with your heart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what if i do n ' t know what my heart is telling me to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you will . [SEP]
[CLS] just give it time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti patted her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you go get cleaned up and then take your lunch break ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i need to make up for the time i ' ve missed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she motioned to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on . [SEP]
[CLS] see if dr . nad ##een is on his way to lunch so you can join him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i should n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] it wo n ' t look right if we ' re alone together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` alone together in a crowded hospital cafeteria ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think that ' s possible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ni ##bbled on her bottom lip and fought the urge to argue with kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , if the very woman who was in charge of her clinical grade did n ' t give a shit about her and pe ##sh being seen together , why should she ? [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she just gave a defeated sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i ' ll go see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good girl . [SEP]
[CLS] and you be listening to your heart now . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll try . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although she spoke the words with such conviction of character , megan was afraid it was going to be harder than she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seventeen when pe ##sh arrived at work the following day , he found kris ##ti alone in the nurses ' station . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing around , he asked , ` ` where ' s megan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , she called in sick today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] both disappointment and concern filled him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had seemed a little off the night before when they had dinner together in the cafeteria . [SEP]
[CLS] she was quieter and somewhat withdrawn . [SEP]
[CLS] he had just chalk ##ed it up to the fact that they were sitting with some of the other staff and she was trying not to make things seem weird with them now . [SEP]
[CLS] he wondered if he should call her and check to make sure she was okay . [SEP]
[CLS] they were in such limb ##o together that even though it sounded like the right thing to do , he was n ' t sure . [SEP]
[CLS] with a resigned sigh , he decided to leave things as they were and vowed to check on her tomorrow when she returned to work . [SEP]
[CLS] as much as pe ##sh hated to admit it , the day dragged mer ##ci ##lessly without megan . [SEP]
[CLS] he went from patient to patient with a mono ##ton ##y he had n ' t felt in a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] when his shift ended , he met kris ##ti in the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want me to walk you out ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it would be my pleasure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they started out the mechanized doors to the employee parking lot . [SEP]
[CLS] to fill the quiet of their shoes echoing on the pavement , he said , ` ` i hated to hear that megan was n ' t feeling well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so did i . [SEP]
[CLS] poor thing offered to pull a double tomorrow to make up for being gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she sure is going to make a fine nurse . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , she is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve taken a special interest in her , have n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti asked . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s steps momentarily faltered , and he stumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know exactly what i mean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is true that we know each other outside of the hospital , but when we ' re in the er , our relationship is strictly professional . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never said it was n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after gazing around the somewhat deserted parking lot , he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what you ' re all ##uding to between me and megan ? [SEP]
[CLS] nothing good can come of those types of rumors . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] patting his arm , kris ##ti smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are no rumors - merely an observation by someone who loves and admire ##s you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t di ##sa ##pp ##rove ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not . [SEP]
[CLS] i think it ' s a good match for both you and her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he remained silent for a few moments , contemplating her words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` perhaps i should call and check on her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think that would be a very good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took her keys out of her purse and motioned at the honda they were standing in front of . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , this is me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have a good night , kris ##ti . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` same to you , dr . nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] and good luck . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he got to his car , he slid inside and took his phone out . [SEP]
[CLS] he scroll ##ed through his contacts to find megan ' s number . [SEP]
[CLS] after he dialed , he anxiously drum ##med his fingers on the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] the call went to her voice ##mail , leaving him with a defeated feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] although he knew it probably was n ' t the best idea in the world , he decided to go to her house to check on her . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment he rang her parents ' doorbell he really regretted making a house call . [SEP]
[CLS] one of her younger brothers answered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , what ' s up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m dr . nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] i work with megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] snapping his fingers , he pointed at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , i know you . [SEP]
[CLS] are n ' t you noah ' s godfather ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cool . [SEP]
[CLS] listen man , megan ' s downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] if you go around the side of the house , she has her own door . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problem . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when the door closed , pe ##sh debated going straight to his car . [SEP]
[CLS] but he knew it would look even worse if her brother told her he had been there and then he had left without seeing her . [SEP]
[CLS] heaving a frustrated breath , he headed off the porch . [SEP]
[CLS] he followed the sidewalk around the house to where it slope ##d down the hill . [SEP]
[CLS] at the side door , he knocked loudly . [SEP]
[CLS] when the door flew open , megan stared at him in a mixture of both surprise and horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shoved his hands in his pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you called in sick today . [SEP]
[CLS] i was worried . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he fought the urge to say that by her dish ##eve ##led appearance and dark circles under her eyes , she most certainly did n ' t seem fine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i tried calling you , but you did n ' t answer . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti and i were worried about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her expression softened a little . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i must ' ve forgotten to charge my phone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i get you something to eat ? [SEP]
[CLS] some soup maybe ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , i ' m fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you look so pale . [SEP]
[CLS] will you let me do an exam ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know the flu is - ' ' ` ` i do n ' t have the flu . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can you be sure if you have n ' t been checked ? [SEP]
[CLS] did you get the flu shot at the hospital ? [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes it can give you a mild case . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t have the flu . [SEP]
[CLS] since you ' re going to keep on and on , i ' m going to go ahead and tell you . [SEP]
[CLS] i have really ho ##rre ##ndo ##us cr ##amps with my period . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , i can manage them with birth control , but when i started clinical ##s and stopped working , i could n ' t afford the birth control without health insurance . [SEP]
[CLS] and it was n ' t like i was ha * * ng s * x anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] while he appreciated her honesty , he was also slightly mort ##ified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry to have embarrassed you , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] he waved his hand dismiss ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` listen , when you return to work tomorrow , there will be a script for you for birth control . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t like the idea of you in pain , so i do n ' t want this to happen next month . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but the money , ' ' she protested . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it will be discount ##ed through the hospital pharmacy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s a very decent thing for you to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a blonde head peeked around megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi es ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] you play ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled at mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i came to check on your mommy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason tilted his chin to look up at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` her tu ##mmy hurts . [SEP]
[CLS] she no play . [SEP]
[CLS] u play ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well . . . ' ' he wanted nothing more than to spend time with mason , and in the same token , with megan as well . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was also walking such a fine line with her that he did n ' t want to come on too strong and scare her off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure your mommy feels up to company . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you really do n ' t mind staying , we ' d love to have you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you certain ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason grabbed his hand and led him through the door . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh took in the cozy decor of the basement apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] in one chair , megan ' s textbooks and papers were strewn around , while on the floor it looked like a tornado had blown through the living room with all the toys lying around . [SEP]
[CLS] when he met her gaze , she flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry it ' s such a mess . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you hungry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m good , ' ' he lied , as his stomach rumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] megan cocked her head and shot him a look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sit down and let me fix you something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not with you feeling un ##well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` although i wish i could cook you something , i think i ' m up to re ##hea ##ting some of the pizza we ordered today , or there are some homemade en ##chi ##lad ##as i made last night , ' ' she replied , as she opened the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` en ##chi ##lad ##as would be lovely . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled and took out a cass ##ero ##le dish . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you hungry , mace ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm , ' ' he murmured , barely looking up at his mother from one of his toys . [SEP]
[CLS] after spoon ##ing out two heap ##ing plates full , along with some rice , she put it in the microwave . [SEP]
[CLS] she then motioned for him to have a seat at the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t need to wait on me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just shut up and let me take care of you for two seconds . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her words reminded him of when she had cleaned his wounds after dev ' s punch . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter what the situation , she was always ready to be there for him and take care of him . [SEP]
[CLS] the microwave bee ##ped and brought him out of his thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] mason hurried over to the table and sat down beside pe ##sh in his booster seat . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan put down the steaming plates , he reached for her hand and kissed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a funny look passed in her eyes before she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wo n ' t you sit with us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , i would love to take a warm bath . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , to see if it would help relax my muscles . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be happy to keep an eye on mason while you do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i do n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] i really appreciate it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she kissed the top of mason ' s head , and then kissed his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to start into the bedroom before w ##hir ##ling back around . [SEP]
[CLS] he lowered his fork at the expression on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] placing her hands on his cheeks , she leaned in and laid a big one on him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t hide his surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] when she pulled away , she grinned at his speechless ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t be long , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] once the bedroom door closed behind her , pe ##sh gazed over at mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want to do when we finish eating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` minions , ' ' he mumbled through a mouthful of food . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh furrowed his brows in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s minions ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] hopping down off his chair , mason ran over to the tv . [SEP]
[CLS] when he returned , he had a dvd box in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed to some yellow b ##lo ##bs on the cover . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` minions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , i see . [SEP]
[CLS] you want to watch this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason bobbed his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it your favorite ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , huh , ' ' mason replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i guess we better eat fast so we can watch it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at mason ' s beaming grin , pe ##sh felt a little tug in his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] even though he should n ' t , he already had strong feelings for the little boy . [SEP]
[CLS] from almost the moment they ' d met , mason had let pe ##sh into his world . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound of a fork cl ##atter ##ing on a plate brought pe ##sh out of his thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` done ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason exclaimed , hopping out of his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] although pe ##sh was n ' t finished , mason grabbed his hand and led him from the table . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of arguing with him , pe ##sh just let himself be dragged over to the tv . [SEP]
[CLS] once he got the movie on , they settled down on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t fight the warmth that spread through his chest when mason snuggled close to his side . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he just embraced the feeling and let happiness over ##ride the doubt that screamed in his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] under the strong , warm jets of the ja ##cu ##zzi tub , megan ' s pain started to fade . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , as much as she tried to relax , it was too hard considering that pe ##sh was in her living room . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her . [SEP]
[CLS] just when she thought he could n ' t be any kind ##er or more at ##ten ##tive , he did something like that . [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her neck on the foam head ##rest , she thought about her talk with kris ##ti the day before . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated to admit it , but she knew she had a choice to make . [SEP]
[CLS] she either had to let go of pe ##sh , or she had to make things official with him . [SEP]
[CLS] they could n ' t just keep dating and hook ##ing up . . . or was it just hook ##ing up ? [SEP]
[CLS] with a frustrated groan , she shifted in the tub , sl ##oshi ##ng the water around . [SEP]
[CLS] closing her eyes , she tried to search her heart for how she truly felt . [SEP]
[CLS] no man had ever made her feel like felt with pe ##sh , and that could be said both inside and out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing down at her pr ##uni ##ng fingers , she knew it was time to get out of the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] she could stay there for days and still not have the answer she so desperately sought . [SEP]
[CLS] after she towel ##ed off and wrapped herself in her terry cloth robe , she went out into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] as she threw on a fresh pair of pa ##ja ##ma pants and a t - shirt , she noticed it was awful ##ly quiet in the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] wondering what mason and pe ##sh could be doing , she ducked out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] the sight across from her on the couch made her chest clench with emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] reaching up , she clutched her t - shirt over her heart , trying to still some of the ache that burned there . [SEP]
[CLS] with the strains of des ##pic ##able me playing in the background , pe ##sh lay on his back with mason on top of him . [SEP]
[CLS] her son ' s face was snuggled into pe ##sh ' s chest , and he was sound asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] they both were . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s face was tilted down , his nose pressed into the strands of mason ' s hair . [SEP]
[CLS] before she could harden herself to the emotions co ##urs ##ing through her , tears stung her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] in that moment , she allowed herself to fan ##tas ##ize that this was truly her life . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a loving husband who adored her , and her son had an at ##ten ##tive and dot ##ing father . [SEP]
[CLS] what more could she ask for in life ? [SEP]
[CLS] in those minutes of weakness , she wondered why she had been fighting pe ##sh so hard about a relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] besides her own happiness , there was nothing more in the world that she wanted than for mason to be safe and happy . [SEP]
[CLS] as she came crashing back to reality , she saw things clearly for the first time in a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh had been so worried about her that he ' d driven over just to check on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never had a boyfriend who cared about her that much , and no matter how hard she searched in the future , she was probably never going to find another man like pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] there were so many things about him that she liked . . . maybe even loved . [SEP]
[CLS] he made her want to get up in the mornings , so she could see him at work . [SEP]
[CLS] she found herself anxiously checking her phone to see if she had a text from him . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved spending time with him . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was more than just the feelings that pe ##sh felt for her or that she felt for him - it was the fact that he cared so much about her son . [SEP]
[CLS] they were a package deal for any future man , and he had willingly embraced that fact without complaint . [SEP]
[CLS] on shaky legs , she walked over to the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] as she stood over the two of them , she could n ' t help reaching out her hand and tenderly touching pe ##sh ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] he stirred at the contact . [SEP]
[CLS] when his eyelids fluttered open , she smiled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his gaze spun around the room like he was trying hard to remember where he was . [SEP]
[CLS] when he glanced down at mason , realization washed over his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to fall asleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure you needed it . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i took too long in the tub . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would argue that you need it as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bending over , she slid her hand under mason ' s stomach while the other went under his legs . [SEP]
[CLS] she hoisted him up and into her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] when he whimpered , she murmured , ` ` sh ##h , mommy ' s going to put you to bed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` night , night , pe ##sh , ' ' mason mumbled dr ##ows ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good night , little man , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] once she had tucked mason in and kissed his cheek , she closed his bedroom door and returned to the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh sat hunched over on the edge of one of the couch cushions , as if he were planning to leave as soon as she came back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is he okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` out like a light the moment i put him down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he started to stand up , she pushed him back down on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] easing down onto his lap , she wrapped her arms around his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his hand up to rub lazy circles over her back . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t speak for a few minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she just enjoyed being close to him , the feel of his hand on her , his strong , muscled thighs beneath her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for coming over tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? [SEP]
[CLS] i was afraid i was overs ##te ##pping my bounds . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ra ##king her fingers through his dark hair , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we need to talk about our boundaries . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you coming over here tonight made me realize something very important . [SEP]
[CLS] what we ' ve been doing has been fun , and i ' ve enjoyed every minute of it . [SEP]
[CLS] but now - ' ' pe ##sh ' s dark eyes snapped shut , and the expression on his face shifted as if he were in pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to say this . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll just go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do n ' t want you to go , ' ' she argued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what are you trying to say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that i need you in my life , and i want more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows shot up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more ? [SEP]
[CLS] as in more of us together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sucked in a breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want us to be an official couple ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i do . [SEP]
[CLS] well , everywhere except work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe it , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t exactly the reaction i thought you would have , ' ' she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m happy . [SEP]
[CLS] trust me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just shocked , that ' s all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she brought her lips to his and gave him a tender kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] against his lips , she murmured , ` ` can you ever forgive me for being so stubborn and so stupid ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can try . [SEP]
[CLS] but i suppose you ' re going to have to work very hard to make it up to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , very hard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do i have the funny feeling that your idea of me making it up to you is entirely different than mine ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no more orgasm ##s for dates . [SEP]
[CLS] just dates . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can handle that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a wicked gleam flashed in pe ##sh ' s eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the first date will be to the fox to see an opera . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t play fair . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ran his hands up her sides , causing her to shiver . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would have to argue that you have n ' t been playing fair all along . [SEP]
[CLS] now it ' s my turn . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to punish me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned in a whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm , there will lots of dates and lots of time spent together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he qui ##rked a brow at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a true hell on earth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help giggling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be a good girl and take it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as they laps ##ed into silence , megan ' s fingers wound through the hair at the base of his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want to stay the night with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s brows furrowed as if silently questioning her proposal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you - ' ' ` ` no sex . [SEP]
[CLS] just sleeping . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think that ' s a good idea with mason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re a couple now . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s going to be seeing a lot of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] staring into his eyes , she asked , ` ` so you ' ll stay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it would be a pleasure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , she rose off his lap . [SEP]
[CLS] after he got up off the sofa , she took him by the hand and led him to her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] as she sat on the edge of the mattress , she watched as pe ##sh stripped down to his boxer shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was finished , he walked slowly over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry we ca n ' t do anything else . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m happy just to be with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in her heart , she was happy as well and not just about him staying the night . [SEP]
[CLS] but for how everything between them had worked out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so am i , ' ' she murmured before lying back on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so am i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eighteen for megan , the next few weeks flew by . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know if it was because she was so busy at work , or it was because she was so happy being with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] she liked to think it was the latter . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe it was that she was busy being with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] on her off days and his , they spent every second together . [SEP]
[CLS] most often , he came to her house . [SEP]
[CLS] they made dinner together or they went out . [SEP]
[CLS] although her parents did n ' t entirely approve , he slept over as well . [SEP]
[CLS] what they did n ' t know is that some nights nothing illicit even happened between them . [SEP]
[CLS] exhausted from the day ' s events , they merely enjoyed lying in each other ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] as she came out of a patient ' s room , she glanced up to see pe ##sh standing across the hall talking to another doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] for just a moment , his gaze met hers , and although no one else could have possibly noticed it , she saw the longing and the affection . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a brief nod before walking on to the nurses ' station . [SEP]
[CLS] since they had become a couple , their time at work had become almost a game of wills to pretend there was nothing going on between them . [SEP]
[CLS] most days , it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to burst out in a smile whenever she saw him or to resist the urge not to wrap her arms around him . [SEP]
[CLS] but somehow they made it work . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , the pen ##t up emotions that were suppressed during the day made for a lot of heated fireworks in the evenings . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s thoughts were interrupted at the buzzing of her phone . [SEP]
[CLS] when she glanced down at it , she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] it was pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] it killed me not to be able to kiss you a moment ago . [SEP]
[CLS] i know . [SEP]
[CLS] me too . [SEP]
[CLS] dinner at my place tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] u cooking ? [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] indian food . [SEP]
[CLS] mmm , sounds good . [SEP]
[CLS] what time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] does mason like indian food ? [SEP]
[CLS] megan eyed his text thoughtfully . [SEP]
[CLS] the last three times she had been with pe ##sh , mason had been with them as well . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh never seemed to mind , but megan wanted a night with just him . [SEP]
[CLS] a true date night . [SEP]
[CLS] not sure . [SEP]
[CLS] will get my parents or papa to baby ##sit . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to do that . [SEP]
[CLS] i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to . [SEP]
[CLS] okay . [SEP]
[CLS] see you at 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] bye . [SEP]
[CLS] she had just slipped her phone back in her pocket when she was ambushed by kara . [SEP]
[CLS] since the day she ' d seen kara gr ##ope pe ##sh in the hallway , megan had lo ##ath ##ed the sight of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had managed to keep her distance from her at work , but lately , she noticed that kara had been creeping around , staring at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i do something for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked politely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , for starters , you can drop the sugar sweet act . [SEP]
[CLS] i know how you feel about me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan fought the urge to roll her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she crossed her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] what do you need kara ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kara glanced around them before she spoke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to back off of pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] narrowing her eyes , kara said , ` ` i know you ' re into him . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see it in the way you look at him . . . it ' s in the way he looks at you , too . [SEP]
[CLS] and i do n ' t like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m terribly sorry that you do n ' t , but frankly , i do n ' t see how any of that is any of your business . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , he is very much my business considering we ' ve been together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , okay . [SEP]
[CLS] whatever , ' ' megan replied , feeling slightly shattered by kara ' s proclamation . [SEP]
[CLS] in the rational side of her mind , she knew there was no way pe ##sh could be involved with kara . [SEP]
[CLS] but at the moment , it was the irrational side that seemed to be winning out over whether pe ##sh was truly hers . [SEP]
[CLS] kara jerked her chin in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides the fact of what pe ##sh and i are to each other , i ' m sure it would be very interesting business to your professor . [SEP]
[CLS] last time i checked , a nursing candidate was n ' t supposed to get involved with a doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] bad for one ' s reputation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you threatening me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after a casual shrug of her shoulders , kara replied , ` ` just stating facts . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t impress me as one of those bi ##mbo girls who likes to be used by a man for sex , which i ' m afraid that ' s exactly what pe ##sh is doing with you . [SEP]
[CLS] but more than not wanting to be a sex toy , i imagine you would n ' t want to do anything to harm your future career . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not discussing this any further , ' ' megan muttered , as she started past her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t be either as long as you stay away from pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without giving kara a final glance , megan continued walking down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know where she was going , but she knew she wanted to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the day she felt haunted by kara ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] more than anything , she could n ' t wait until she could be alone with pe ##sh to talk to him about it . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh jerked his head up at the loud bang behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] the garage door leading into the kitchen was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges . [SEP]
[CLS] megan stalked into the room , her mouth turned down in a determined frown . [SEP]
[CLS] she threw her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar stool ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] with a frustrated breath , she blew back a few er ##rant strands of blonde hair that had escaped the loose knot at the back of her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bad day ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , with thin ##ly veil ##ed amusement . [SEP]
[CLS] she glared at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , as a matter of fact it was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , where do i start ? [SEP]
[CLS] when i went to drop mason off at papa ' s house , there was a woman there with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` patrick is dating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he claims she ' s - ' ' megan paused to make air quotes with her fingers , ` ` just a friend . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t buy it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he stirred the rice , he glanced at her over his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would it be wrong if he were dating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a long sigh escaped megan ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he deserves to be happy . [SEP]
[CLS] my nana has been dead for six years , so it ' s not like he raced out the moment he was free and started going through women like k ##leen ##ex . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled at her sum ##mation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you not like her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing her arms over her chest , megan replied , ` ` that ' s the other part . [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed really nice . [SEP]
[CLS] and mason loves her . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess she ' s been there before when he stayed with papa . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after abandoning his place by the stove , pe ##sh placed his hands on the marble counter ##top and leaned in close to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it sounds to me like patrick has found a good woman who loves him and his family . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think you could ask for a better scenario . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stared into his eyes for a moment before she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re right . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know why i got so upset about it all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because as much as you love your grandfather , you ' re still protective of your grandmother ' s memory . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so wise , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it comes with age , ' ' he replied , with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a quick kiss on the lips before returning to the stove . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so besides patrick ' s new lady friend , what else happened to get you so upset ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when megan did n ' t reply , pe ##sh turned around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need to have a serious discussion with kara . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , you do remember that i ' m not in charge of nurses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i realize that . [SEP]
[CLS] but you are in charge of your dick , are you not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , ` ` kara seems to think that the two of you are an item . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh that ' s nonsense . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re just friends from working together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve never seen her outside of work ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] this was one area of questioning he had n ' t bargain ##ed on ever having to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] the truth was something he really did n ' t want to admit to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] carefully choosing his words , he replied , ` ` we got together for drinks a couple of times after work a few months back . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly think that cat ##ego ##rize ##s us as an ' item . ' ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it must be enough for her to think she can tell me that you ' re only using me for sex . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh winced at the words . [SEP]
[CLS] he would have never taken kara for being someone who was jealous . [SEP]
[CLS] he put down the spat ##ula and turned off the stove . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he could n ' t go forward without coming clean . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , i have n ' t been honest with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you that kara and i had only had drinks a couple of times . [SEP]
[CLS] but that is n ' t the whole truth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you saying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] defeated , his shoulders dr ##ooped a little . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after the night of noah ' s baptism , i could n ' t get you off my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to prove to myself that i was n ' t so en ##amo ##red by you . [SEP]
[CLS] so after having a couple of drinks one night , kara and i went to my car and fooled around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you got drunk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gave a mir ##th ##less laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is what is most shocking to you in what i just told you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with some woman when we were n ' t dating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' he answered honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what you did then was your business . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i ' m not thrilled to hear that you fooled around with her , especially since you would n ' t sleep with me when i asked you to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but do n ' t you see the difference ? [SEP]
[CLS] i cared for you , and i cared nothing for her . [SEP]
[CLS] we were barely in the car fifteen minutes if that tells you anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her lips tugged up in a small smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really do n ' t need the details of how much you did n ' t enjoy yourself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ducked his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i should n ' t have said that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but at the same time , i ' m glad to hear that you wo n ' t be going back for a repeat performance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jerking his gaze up to meet hers , he replied , ` ` never could i do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you really were trying to get me off your mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in a warped way , that ' s very romantic , ' ' she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you think so , ' ' he mumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , it ' s not the fact that she said you were using me for sex that has me so upset . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she threatened me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s eyes narrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` physically ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] she said that if i did n ' t watch my back , she would report me to the dean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a low growl erupted from pe ##sh ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she seriously said that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , she did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry that her jealousy and spite ##fulness is rear ##ing its head . [SEP]
[CLS] i never imagined she was such a person when i . . . well , when i got involved with her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll make sure to speak to her . [SEP]
[CLS] no one should have to work in a hostile environment , and she must understand that just because of her senior ##ity , she is not allowed to hara ##ss you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh watched megan fi ##dget on her feet while ni ##bbling on her bottom lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you not want me to speak to her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . ' ' ` ` is there something else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know how much i like you . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , the very fact i agreed to date you shows how much i ' m committed to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh crossed his arms over his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m thinking there ' s a ' but ' coming that i ' m not going to like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but at the same time , whatever it is that is happening between us . . . ' ' she swallowed hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve worked really hard in school , pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want anything on my record that could hurt my chances of getting a job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if she was the crying type , he would have sworn her eyes shi ##mmer ##ed with tears . [SEP]
[CLS] he came around the counter to pull her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey now , do n ' t you worry one bit about getting into trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] anyone who has seen you in action on the floor knows what a talented and gifted nurse you are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sniff ##led . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if there ' s even a rumor of me having an affair with an attending physician , i could be black ##list ##ed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh pulled away to grip her chin in his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after i speak to kara , you will have nothing to worry about , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell that even though she wanted to relax and let go of her anxiety , she could n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s fix you up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wiped her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , he went over to the cabinet and got down a wine glass . [SEP]
[CLS] then he poured some white wine into the glass before setting it down on the bar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan glanced at the glass and then back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you trying to pl ##y me with wine ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned forward and picked it up . [SEP]
[CLS] he watched as she could n ' t resist the temptation and she took a heart ##y gulp . [SEP]
[CLS] closing her eyes , she murmured , ` ` that ' s so good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walked around the counter again . [SEP]
[CLS] this time he took her free hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are we going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for part two of your relaxation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled at him before he began tugging her down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] when he got into the bedroom , he noticed her sigh of frustration when they bypassed the bed for the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` while i finish dinner for us , you need to so ##ak in a nice , hot bath . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you spoil me , ' ' she protested with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he gave her a playful wink before turning on the bath water . [SEP]
[CLS] once he got the temperature right , he turned back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bubbles ? [SEP]
[CLS] bath salt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she raised her brows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t tell me you actually have those ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i know you ' re a metro ##se ##x ##ual but really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we all have our secrets , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t have the heart to tell her that he had kept some of jade ' s bath and body works stuff . [SEP]
[CLS] he might ' ve tried to bury them under the bathroom counter to get them out of sight and out of mind , but they were still there . [SEP]
[CLS] he rum ##mage ##d around to pull out a vanilla bottle as well as a peach . [SEP]
[CLS] he held them up to megan for her approval . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , vanilla . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it was the one scent that did n ' t remind him of jade since she never used it . [SEP]
[CLS] he poured a healthy cup ##ful under the water , letting the foam mag ##ni ##fy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready to get in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan glanced down at herself before looking back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i seem to still be dressed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh cocked his head at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i can help you with that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took the wine glass from her and sat it on the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers came to the hem of her shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] without taking his eyes off of hers , he jerked it up and over her head . [SEP]
[CLS] he gazed down at her simple , white bra . [SEP]
[CLS] she sucked in a breath when his fingers skimmed her abdomen before he gripped the waistband of her scrub ##s and tugged them down . [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped out of the pants , standing before him in only her bra and ski ##mp ##y thong . [SEP]
[CLS] taking her by the shoulders , he gently turned her around . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers trailed down her back to the clasp of her bra . [SEP]
[CLS] once he un ##ho ##oked it , he brought his hands up to slide it off her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] unable to resist the softness of her skin , he bent his head to kiss along her back . [SEP]
[CLS] as he dropped the bra to the floor , his hands skimmed up her rib ##ca ##ge to cup her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' megan murmured , letting her head fall back against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m only supposed to be und ##ress ##ing you , ' ' he argued , as he let her br * * sts fall free of his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] she immediately picked them up and brought them back to cup her flesh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the way you und ##ress me . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s very relaxing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rolling her puck ##ered ni * * les between his fingers , he was rewarded with her gasp of pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the water is getting cold , ' ' he warned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m getting so hot , i can warm it up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled against her ear before taking his hands away from her . [SEP]
[CLS] as she w ##hine ##d in protest , his fingers jerked her thong down over her thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] she raised her feet to step out of the underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right . [SEP]
[CLS] get in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tease , ' ' she muttered , before walking over to the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] he only got to admire her na * * d backside for a moment before she lowered herself into the tub and disappeared under the foam . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning back against the wall , she closed her eyes in bliss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this feels amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you know what would feel even better ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes popped open , and she smiled inviting ##ly up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you were in here with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should be finishing dinner , ' ' he argued , fee ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan eyed the growing bulge in his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you should be in here letting me finish you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he threw his head back and laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you drive a hard bargain , my lady . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly un ##bu ##tton ##ed and took off his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] then his fingers went to the button and zipper on his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid them and his boxers down and stepped out of them , leaving him naked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan did n ' t take her eyes off him the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] he shifted them in the water , bringing megan up to st ##rad ##dle him , but she was facing away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his hands to her shoulders and started mass ##aging the tense muscles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` helping you relax . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ground herself against his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was hoping a couple of orgasm ##s would do that instead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you believe in fore ##play ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , but not when i ' m this horn ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bending his head , he let his warm breath tick ##le her outer ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you , my love , are never going to be a candidate for tan ##tric sex . [SEP]
[CLS] you will never allow yourself to enjoy delayed pleasure and release . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to try - honest , i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but just not this evening , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] one of his hands abandoned her shoulder to slide down in between her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped as his thumb rubbed against her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] as he continued stroking her with his thumb , he pushed two fingers into her slick passage . [SEP]
[CLS] megan whimpered and thrust her h * ps against him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh kissed and licked her wet neck and back as he pumped his fingers in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that feel good ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , oh yes , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] he increased the pressure of his thumb , and megan shrieked , buck ##ing her h * ps faster and faster against his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] when his other hand cupped and kn ##ead ##ed her breast , she cried out and came , her walls clenching against his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] once she finished shuddering , she collapsed back against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` feeling better now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she twisted her body around to where she was facing him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you inside me the next time i come . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rose up and then took his erection in her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] while keeping her eyes on his , she guided him into her core . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , she sunk inch by inch on him . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was fully seated , they both moaned at the feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] at the intensity of what he felt inside her , pe ##sh was thankful she had taken him up on the birth control script where he did n ' t have to use condoms anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] she brought her hands up to his shoulders , and then she began to ride him . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands came to grip her waist as his head bent forward to suck ##le one of her ni * * les into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] his teeth grazed the bud before his tongue flicked and teased it into a hardened point . [SEP]
[CLS] throwing her head back , megan ' s walls tensed and con ##vu ##ls ##ed around him . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he had a long way to go before he was going to come . [SEP]
[CLS] once she recovered , megan panted as she started riding him faster , causing the water to sl ##osh around them . [SEP]
[CLS] as his mouth latch ##ed onto her other breast , megan threw her head back and moaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` harder , ' ' she urged . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh continued sucking her nipple as he began to thrust his h * ps up in time to meet her movements . [SEP]
[CLS] each time he went a little deeper , and it caused megan to be more and more vocal . [SEP]
[CLS] she tugged at the strands of his hair and clawed at his chest as she st ##rove harder and harder for her orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , please , ' ' she panted , as her hands came to cup her own br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] as she pinched and t ##we ##ake ##d her own ni * * les , it was pe ##sh ' s undo ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] shoving his hand down between her legs , he flicked her clit , sending her over the edge again . [SEP]
[CLS] her movements caused him to jerk once and then come in her . [SEP]
[CLS] once he finished shuddering and came back to himself , megan stared at him with an utterly sat ##iated expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was . . . amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where did a nice boy like you learn to f * * k ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled at her choice of language . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , a person ' s reputation has nothing to do with how they are in the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure there are many tough biker dude ##s out there who would n ' t know a clit ##oris from a lab ##ia - if they even knew that terminology . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm , i suppose that ' s true . [SEP]
[CLS] my ex liked to think he was a ladies man , but half of the time , i had to take matters into my own hands if i was going to finish . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shot him a wicked grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thankfully , i have a lover now who has the most amazing tongue and dick . [SEP]
[CLS] i never have to worry about coming now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and do n ' t you forget how amazing he is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her expression turned solemn as she replied , ` ` i could never forget his attributes both in and out of the bedroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after he gave her a somewhat cha ##ste kiss , he asked , ` ` how about we test out my kitchen attributes now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m starving , ' ' she replied , as she climbed out of the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh followed her out , handing her one of his plush towels . [SEP]
[CLS] after she finished drying off , he gave her a terry cloth robe to put on . [SEP]
[CLS] she slid it on and tied the front together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll bring it to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dinner in bed ? [SEP]
[CLS] that would be marvelous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he winked before heading out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he fixed two heap ##ing plate ##ful ##s of food . [SEP]
[CLS] after putting the plates on a tray , he got two bottles of water out of the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] when he got back to the bedroom , he found her lou ##nging back against the pillows with an expression of pure relaxation . [SEP]
[CLS] after he set the tray down on the bed , he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to try something with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he und ##id the ties on his robe , letting it fall open . [SEP]
[CLS] after shrug ##ging it off his shoulders , he stood na * * d before her . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without answering her , he climbed onto the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands went to the lap ##els on her robe . [SEP]
[CLS] he opened them and then pushed the robe open to her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought we were eating dinner , ' ' she murmured hu ##ski ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] while her brows furrowed in confusion , he passed her a plate and a fork . [SEP]
[CLS] then he took his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh , why are we eating dinner naked ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to teach you about delayed gr ##ati ##fication . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the tan ##tric stuff ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she eyed him curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look into my eyes , ' ' he commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] when her blazing blue eyes were trained on his , he brought a fork ##ful of food to her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` open up , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze held his as her tongue darted out , tentatively tasting the spicy rice . [SEP]
[CLS] when she decided that she liked it , her mouth clamped over the fork . [SEP]
[CLS] as she chewed , she still remained staring at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` feed me , ' ' he insisted . [SEP]
[CLS] she momentarily broke their eye contact to stare down at the plate . [SEP]
[CLS] she spear ##ed a piece of lamb before bringing it to his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] after he took in the bite , his tongue slid over his lips , licking up the remaining sauce . [SEP]
[CLS] something stirred in her at his action - a slight tremble . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought a piece of lamb to her mouth , and she wrinkled her nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t like lamb . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded and then took the bite for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he then picked some of the vegetables and brought them to her . [SEP]
[CLS] this time she took the fork ##ful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s very good , pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] each time she took the fork into her mouth , he could n ' t help imagining that it was his c * * k instead . [SEP]
[CLS] sitting na * * d with her in such a close proximity had his juice ##s beginning to flow . [SEP]
[CLS] when she lowered her gaze to eye her plate for his next bite , she caught sight of his growing erection . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately , she started to put her plate down , but he stopped her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' re hard , and i ' m getting wet sitting here with you staring at me like you ' re already buried inside me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s the point , my love . [SEP]
[CLS] how good do you think it ' s going to be when i do finally get inside you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] as she swept up a fork ##ful of rice , she brought it to his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how long do we do this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` until we clean our plates . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she appeared both disappointed and frustrated at his response . [SEP]
[CLS] to give her something else to focus on , he brought the fork to her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] she took from him , chewing method ##ically while staring into his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] each time he fed her a bite , he tried convey ##ing through his gaze what he was imagining doing to her . [SEP]
[CLS] a bite of vegetables had him sucking her breast , his tongue flicking over her nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] a fork ##ful of rice had his face buried in her wet core as he licked her juice ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] as she chewed and swallowed , pe ##sh could tell desire was over ##taking her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i have some water ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] with a nod , he brought one of the bottles to her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she drank in long gulp ##s , her eyes never leaving his . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finished swallowing , she gave him a grateful smile . [SEP]
[CLS] then in a flash , she tackled him , causing his plate to flip over onto the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cried . [SEP]
[CLS] she was too busy kicking out of her robe to care . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sight of smeared vegetables and rice on the sheet next to him , he began to laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] his chest shook so hard that he wanted to clutch his stomach , but megan ' s body was in the way . [SEP]
[CLS] as she gazed down at him , he pushed the long , blonde strands of hair out of her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t believe we were finished eating , ' ' he cha ##stis ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] she drew his bottom lip between her teeth , causing him to groan . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , her wet core ground against his cock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess you ' ll just have to punish me the next time , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] cupping her bu * * o ##cks , he sent a res ##ound ##ing smack against one of her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh nad ##een , did you actually just span ##k my ass ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned up at her before smack ##ing the other cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , i like this side of you , ' ' she murmured , before bringing her lips to his . [SEP]
[CLS] as their tongues battled against each other , pe ##sh flipped megan over onto her back . [SEP]
[CLS] after spreading her legs , he buried himself deep inside her with one thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , that feels amazing , ' ' she cried . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see how much better it is when you wait ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned , as he leisure ##ly moved in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , mmm , it ' s so good . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although her body trembled , she was n ' t close yet . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued his pace of slow strokes within her . [SEP]
[CLS] then he took her legs and put them on his shoulders to where he could pump deeper inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she moaned at the feeling , her hands sliding up above her head to grip the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ducked his head to bring his mouth to her br * * sts , alternating between each one . [SEP]
[CLS] as he felt her begin to tense up , he increased the pressure of his tongue on her ni * * les , lightly grazing them with his teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] and then she came apart beneath him , crying out and clasp ##ing her hands onto his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] the sight of her was so all ##uring he could n ' t hold back , and he came in a rush inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] when he ' d finished shuddering , he raised his head to gaze down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyelids fluttered open , and then she smiled sheep ##ishly up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry for being a tan ##tric sex failure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` baby , i do n ' t care about that one bit . [SEP]
[CLS] i like the fact you ' re aggressive when it comes to f * * king . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her hands feather ##ed over his back and down to his ass . [SEP]
[CLS] as she squeezed his cheeks , he sucked in a breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re very good at that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how good are you at laundry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , motion ##ing to the left ##over dinner that was now stain ##ing the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] she swat ##ted his ass playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was planning on taking care of that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we get dressed and then sit down and really eat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think that sounds like a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to make sure you ' re feeling your best for what i have to ask you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as he pulled himself off megan , her brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ca n ' t it wait until we finish eating ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rolling her eyes , megan said , ` ` you know i ca n ' t wait for things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh sighed as he bent down to pick up his robe . [SEP]
[CLS] as he slid his arm through the hole , he met megan ' s questioning gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wanted to invite you to dinner at my sister ' s house this weekend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i think i can do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you think i would need to be feeling my best for that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it wo n ' t just be my sister and her husband . [SEP]
[CLS] all of my family will be there , including my parents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want to introduce me to your parents ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i would . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ni ##bbled on her bottom lip as she was prone to do when she was nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but that would mean we ' re pretty serious , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' he replied , with utter certainty . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##oot ##ing to the edge of the bed , she gripped her gaping robe as best she could . [SEP]
[CLS] she stared up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not the least bit worried what they ' re going to say about you dating me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her lips tugged up in a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then i ' ll go , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she bobbed her head , he rushed forward to wrap her in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , my love . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve made me very happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you make me happy every day . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the least i can do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with her head buried in pe ##sh ' s chest , she was finally able to let the smile she had plastered on fade into a frown . [SEP]
[CLS] while she should have been el ##ated that pe ##sh wanted to introduce her to his family , she could n ' t help feeling overwhelmed . [SEP]
[CLS] what if they hated her ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if their dislike caused pe ##sh to not want to see her anymore ? [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , it was hard processing all the emotions that pe ##sh ' s devotion made her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] davis had never wanted to introduce her to his parents . [SEP]
[CLS] she met them by accident after one of his games . [SEP]
[CLS] now she had a man who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hard to process . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , she could only hope that everything went well . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter nineteen the following day at work when pe ##sh found a lu ##ll in patients , he stepped into the nurses ' station . [SEP]
[CLS] while he said hello to some of the other men and women of the nursing staff , he had a singular focus of getting to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] when he joined her at the counter where she was doing paperwork , she jumped like he had ta ##ser ##ed her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go away , ' ' megan hissed . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i think i can be seen back here in the nurses ' station without arising any suspicion . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , i could be discussing a patient with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you better start talking in patient codes very soon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday evening ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when megan jerked her gaze off the chart she was working on , her blue eyes bulge ##d in horror at him . [SEP]
[CLS] in a low voice , she said , ` ` i can not believe you are talking about a date here at work . [SEP]
[CLS] do you care anything about my reputation ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he held his hands up defensive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know what i was thinking besides the fact that i missed you and wanted to talk to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s expression softened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , but we ca n ' t be that way here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh opened his mouth to protest when a voice behind them cut him off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you two look cozy , ' ' kara mused . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh whirled around to find kara staring at them with venom burning in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , but i need to get another chart off the carousel , ' ' megan said , with her head tucked to her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to go , but kara reached out and grabbed her arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t mind , exam room three needs a clean - up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` kris ##ti is the only one authorized to give me orders around here , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] kara pursed her ruby red lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ins ##ub ##ord ##ination and sleeping with a doctor - you really have a career death wish , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan started to protest , but pe ##sh stopped her . [SEP]
[CLS] glaring at kara , he said , ` ` i want to talk to you . [SEP]
[CLS] alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after shooting megan a triumphant look , kara let pe ##sh lead her out of the nurses ' station and down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what in the hell do you think you ' re doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` saving you from making a huge mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t need a girl like that - you need a woman to take care of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when her hands started to snake up around his neck , pe ##sh grabbed them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t touch me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he snarled . [SEP]
[CLS] a sul ##try smile spread across her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you liked when i touched you before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was one time - a drunken mistake that i regret daily , and i never intend on making again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she narrowed her eyes at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re throwing me aside for a young bi ##mbo ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do not speak that way about megan ever again . [SEP]
[CLS] do you hear me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and do you really feel that she thinks you ' re worth throwing her career away for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh closed the gap between them . [SEP]
[CLS] looming over kara , his entire body shuddered in anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` listen to me when i say that if you threaten to expose megan one more time , i will make life a living hell for you . [SEP]
[CLS] as the supervising physician over the er , i can have you shipped off to some hell ##hole far from here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glared down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you understand me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she slowly nodded her head as the realization that there was nothing between them finally dawned on her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' ll excuse me , i need to go clean my exam room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she hurried past him , pe ##sh exhaled a breath of relief . [SEP]
[CLS] he never used that tone of voice with women , or men for that matter , unless he was absolutely pushed to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] but kara ' s previous behavior and the way she ' d acted today had forced him to become what he was n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] at the feel of a hand on his back , he whirled around . [SEP]
[CLS] megan gave him a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my hero ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed at her expression and words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to worry about her hara ##ssing you or me for that matter . [SEP]
[CLS] i took care of things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i heard you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you thought so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never had a man take up for me like that before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s a shame . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if we were n ' t in the middle of the er ' s hallway , i ' d kiss you to show my gratitude . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll gladly take a rain check . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh you will ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s good to know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lowering his voice , he said , ` ` i ' ll expect that kiss later tonight when we ' re alone . [SEP]
[CLS] and i do n ' t just want it on the lips . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want it on several places on my body . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think that can be arranged . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be looking forward to it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a nurse called from the top of the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re needed in r ##xa ##m room four . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as soon as i finish this patient consultation , i ' ll be there , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] at his b ##lat ##ant lie , megan covered her mouth to hide her giggling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go . [SEP]
[CLS] but can i come over tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . [SEP]
[CLS] let me get mason fed and bathed , and then i ' m yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you later . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he winked at her before he turned and started down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] a few nights later pe ##sh found himself speeding along the quiet streets of megan ' s neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] his phone ding ##ed once again . [SEP]
[CLS] slowing down , he took a peek to make sure it was n ' t the hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t too surprised to find it was another text from megan . [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell from the way she had been frantically text ##ing him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous , which was totally surprising to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so strong and fearless that it was hard for him to imagine her ever feeling nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] but he supposed that in megan ' s mind she had good cause to be nervous as tonight he was introducing her to his family . [SEP]
[CLS] after he picked her up , they were going to his sister , sh ##vet ##a ' s , house for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be there . [SEP]
[CLS] although he had spent a lot of time with her family , it had n ' t quite meant the same thing as her spending time with his . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t know if her nerves stemmed from simply meeting his family or if they were from the fear of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few months . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned into the driveway at ten after seven . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even get up the front porch steps before the door flew open , and megan rushed out . [SEP]
[CLS] her dim ##in ##utive figure wo ##bbled a little on the black high heels she was sporting . [SEP]
[CLS] she wore black pants , and a dress ##y red top that had a lot of bea ##ding . [SEP]
[CLS] it reminded him of the kurt ##a , a style that women from his culture wore . [SEP]
[CLS] he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look beautiful , ' ' pe ##sh murmured , leaning in to kiss her tenderly . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did n ' t warm to his touch , he gazed down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rolling her eyes , she snapped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` du ##h , i ' m really nervous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re really that worried about my family ' s opinion of you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she threw up her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , i am . [SEP]
[CLS] your family is very important to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want . . . ' ' she tore her gaze from his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t want what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to bring shame to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t believe megan was so concerned with his family ' s opinion . [SEP]
[CLS] his heartbeat accelerated at the thought . [SEP]
[CLS] it had to mean she really was falling in love with him . [SEP]
[CLS] he brushed a silky strand of blonde hair out of her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sweetheart , you ' re not the first american girl i ' ve brought home with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' m well aware of that . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m also aware of the fact of how well your family loved and accepted jade . [SEP]
[CLS] it might not be the same way with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stared up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not like her , pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not meek and good - hearted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not true . [SEP]
[CLS] you are good - hearted . [SEP]
[CLS] i see that part of you each and every day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cupping her chin with his fingers , he brought her gaze to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you saw my brother , dev . [SEP]
[CLS] through all of his miss ##te ##ps and antics , my parents still love him very much . [SEP]
[CLS] so i promise you there is nothing you can do to where they wo n ' t like you or where you ' ll bring shame on me . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave a reluctant nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking her by the hand , he led her off the porch . [SEP]
[CLS] once he ' d gotten her in the car , he went around and slid into the driver ' s seat . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh crank ##ed up the car , megan gasped in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she motioned to the clock on the dash . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , we ' re going to be late . [SEP]
[CLS] can i make a worse first impression ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i should tell you a few things , et ##ique ##tte wise , so tonight will go a little easier . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what does that have to do with us being late ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because it ' s considered good form to arrive thirty minutes late . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` huh , i did n ' t know that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , how could you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i tried doing a little research . [SEP]
[CLS] i even watched monsoon wedding , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , it was pretty good . [SEP]
[CLS] i kinda hated there were n ' t more dance numbers and songs . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , i ' m pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into song like in a bollywood movie tonight , ' ' he said , with amusement ringing in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t expect them to , smart - ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ts ##ked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so test ##y tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after ex ##haling a long breath , she gave him an apologetic smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i ' m so bitch ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not bitch ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re lying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless of your out - of - control emotions , i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the moment the words left his lips he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] there was the big l word . [SEP]
[CLS] they had n ' t actually exchanged it yet , and now he ' d managed to screw up and say it before he could find the right time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , did you have to say that now ? [SEP]
[CLS] like i ' m not nervous enough ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] burying her head in her hands , she groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is . . . you are . . . i . . . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , you don ' t - ' ' ` ` i love you , too ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shouted from behind her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands jerked on the wheel , and he sent the car care ##ening onto the emergency lane . [SEP]
[CLS] when he recovered and got the car back into the right lane , he dared himself to look over at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she peeked at him through her fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] i really f * * king do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh megan , ' ' he whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling her hands away from her face , she gave him a genuine smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you more than any man i ' ve ever known . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you more - ' ' suddenly he found himself unable to continue . [SEP]
[CLS] did he love her more than he had jade ? [SEP]
[CLS] he had spent years with jade and had only months with megan . [SEP]
[CLS] if he did love megan more , what did that say about his relationship with jade ? [SEP]
[CLS] she reached over and took one of his hands in hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , you do n ' t have to say what i said . [SEP]
[CLS] our situations are completely different . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he clenched and uncle ##nched his jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no woman wants half a man ' s heart , ' ' he argued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i know it is n ' t half your heart . [SEP]
[CLS] and i would n ' t want you to stop loving me just because i died , so why would i expect you to do the same with jade ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not fair to you , ' ' he cr ##oa ##ked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` life ' s not fair , baby . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to get used to that one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she squeezed his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , i know what i feel when i feel your love . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no half about it . [SEP]
[CLS] you love me with all your heart and soul . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i honestly do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] un ##fast ##ening her seat belt , she lunged over to kiss him . [SEP]
[CLS] when she started to deep ##en the kiss , he had to pull away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey now , you got ta stop that or we ' re not going to make it to my parents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled and then eased back down into her seat . [SEP]
[CLS] she managed to behave herself the remaining five minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled into his parents drive , he saw it was already crowded with cars . [SEP]
[CLS] the sight of so many people set megan off , and she began tapping her fingers nervously on her leg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , as he turned to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as i ' ll ever be , ' ' she muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head as he got out of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] like always , he opened her car door and helped her out . [SEP]
[CLS] as they started up the sidewalk , megan was a flu ##rry of movement . [SEP]
[CLS] she smoothed down her hair and then she adjusted her top . [SEP]
[CLS] then she fiddle ##d with her purse on her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` quit fi ##dget ##ing , ' ' pe ##sh whispered , as he rang the doorbell . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m nervous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , they ' re going to love you . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re going to hate me because i ' m not a sub ##missive indian woman . [SEP]
[CLS] wait until they hear i had a child out of wed ##lock . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ll be ready to di ##so ##wn you then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the door flew open , cutting off the rest of their conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` brother , it ' s so good to see you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brother - in - law , sanjay , cried . [SEP]
[CLS] after he hugged pe ##sh , his gaze went to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes widened , and he gasped in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , hello . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] sanjay gave pe ##sh a curious look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t tell me you were bringing company . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a self - assured tone , he added , ` ` she ' s my girlfriend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] well , what about that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sanjay gave megan a welcoming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re so glad to have you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] as sanjay turned to go into the living room , megan smacked pe ##sh ' s arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t tell them you were bringing me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i like the element of surprise when it comes to my love life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` s - seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sp ##uttered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s better this way . [SEP]
[CLS] trust me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she could say anything else , pe ##sh started taking off his shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] wide - eyed , megan watched him . [SEP]
[CLS] quickly , she stepped out of her heels and put them in the pile next to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more et ##ique ##tte you forgot to tell me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hissed . [SEP]
[CLS] he patted the small of her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as they came into the living room , pe ##sh felt megan tense at his side . [SEP]
[CLS] he supposed that it was overwhelming coming into a room packed full of strangers . [SEP]
[CLS] his sister , sh ##vet ##a , came forward first . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello brother . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re looking well this evening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] so are you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he hugged her tight . [SEP]
[CLS] as he pulled away , he glanced down at her swollen belly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and how is the future prince doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sh ##vet ##a smiled and brought her hand to her abdomen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s busy kicking me at the moment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she sp ##ied megan behind him , she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and who is this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he drew in a breath and gazed around his family . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` before i go through this with each and every one of you , i might as well get it out of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to introduce you to someone very special , my girlfriend , megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] deafening silence rev ##er ##ber ##ated around the room after his statement . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother and father exchanged a glance before staring back at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] megan tucked herself even closer to his side . [SEP]
[CLS] although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his culture , he wrapped his arm around her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , say something , ' ' he commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re sorry , son . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just you caught us off guard , ' ' his mother said . [SEP]
[CLS] his father ' s bush ##y brows rose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re really dating , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at his declaration , his father clapped his hands and grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is most wonderful to hear ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he came forward to embrace megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are very welcome here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m charlie , ' ' his father introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , ' ' she replied , with a small smile . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh peered past his father where his mother stood chewing her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell she was n ' t entirely happy that another blonde - haired , blue - eyed woman was standing beside her son . [SEP]
[CLS] while sh ##vet ##a and ar ##jan had both sought out indian partners to marry , he and dev were somewhat the black sheep since they had n ' t chosen to settle down with women within their culture . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , his mother ' s manners won out over anything else , and she stepped forward to shake megan ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m lava ##ni . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s nice to meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice meeting you , too , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] the room then fell into an awkward silence . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh glanced around , willing someone to say something . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother cleared her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go and finish up dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she started into the kitchen , sh ##vet ##a followed her , along with ar ##jan ' s wife . [SEP]
[CLS] since it was customary for women to be in the kitchen , pe ##sh found it to be only megan left with the men . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t go without her notice either . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` should i go and offer to help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned , in a whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] that would be nice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her expression told him that she really did n ' t want to leave his side , but she did anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] once she was out of ears ##hot , pe ##sh found everyone ' s eyes on him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] charlie chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you even have to ask , my son ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ask your questions and get it over with before megan comes back in here , ' ' he replied , as he collapsed onto the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] he faced a barrage of questions about where they met , how long they had been seeing each other , and how serious was it . [SEP]
[CLS] he mustered as much patience as he could to answer them all . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was finished , the men sat back in surprised silence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never thought i would see the day , ' ' his father mused . [SEP]
[CLS] sanjay shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i knew the day would come . [SEP]
[CLS] i saw that when he was out with emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] charlie ' s brows furrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh pinched his eyes shut and wished his brother - in - law did n ' t have such a good memory . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a friend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a snort , sanjay replied , ` ` you certainly did n ' t look at her like she was a friend , even if she was pregnant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were with a pregnant woman ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] charlie asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h how could you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his mother demanded from the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how could i what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni ' s expression was horror stricken . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get a woman . . . in the family way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh rocket ##ed off the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced past his mother to where megan stood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t even form the words . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s face flushed blood red . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] of course , i ' m not ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni gave him a confused look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not her , ' ' she replied , pointing at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this emma that sanjay speaks of . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bringing his hand to his forehead , he rubbed furiously to try to ward off the ache that was starting to pound in his head . [SEP]
[CLS] everything was getting shot to hell so fast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first of all , emma and i were never intimate . [SEP]
[CLS] she was pregnant by the man she is now married to . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , i took her to the opera with sanjay and sh ##vet ##a , but there was nothing really between us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head and could n ' t help wondering if he would ever have to stop explaining what had happened between him and emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` second of all , could everyone just back off for a second ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , you ' re not exactly giving megan a very good impression of our family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a nervous laugh erupted from megan ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she covered her mouth with her hand , trying to hide her giggling . [SEP]
[CLS] he winked at her , and she lowered her hand to smile at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , fine . [SEP]
[CLS] now that we ' ve cleared all that up , why do n ' t we eat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds wonderful , ' ' charlie replied . [SEP]
[CLS] as they made their way into the dining room , pe ##sh went to megan ' s side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you surviving okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m hanging in there . [SEP]
[CLS] i may need a drink when we leave . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just no silver tequila for you , ' ' he mused . [SEP]
[CLS] without the others catching her , megan smacked his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ass , ' ' she hissed under her breath . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled as he held out the chair for megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said before sitting down . [SEP]
[CLS] he then eased in beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] as the dishes began making their way around the table , he felt megan kick him . [SEP]
[CLS] when he glanced at her in surprise , she whispered , ` ` where is the silver ##ware ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we eat with our hands . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned over to whisper in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but do n ' t use your left hand because it ' s considered rude . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked back to stare wide - eyed at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m left handed , ' ' she protested . [SEP]
[CLS] he fought the urge to smile at her horror . [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell that she would rather die than do something to em ##bar ##ras ##s him in front of his family . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll be fine . [SEP]
[CLS] they wo n ' t expect as much out of you since you ' re american . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h , whatever is it that you ' re whispering about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni asked , narrowing her eyes at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was just telling megan what a wonderful cook you are . [SEP]
[CLS] she loves indian food , so i ' m sure she ' s in for a treat . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh squeezed megan ' s knee under the table . [SEP]
[CLS] she cut her eyes over to him and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] once the plates had been passed around and everyone served , they began to eat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , the sam ##osa is delicious , ' ' megan complimented . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' lava ##ni replied , with a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] as his mother turned her attention to sh ##vet ##a , pe ##sh bowed his head and spoke in a low voice to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` once i tried br ##ib ##ing beau with some sam ##osa . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did ? [SEP]
[CLS] why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was at aidan ' s house checking on emma when she was on bed rest . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess you could say he did n ' t like me invading his turf . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would he not take it from you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , he took it , ate it , and seemed to enjoy it . [SEP]
[CLS] but i did n ' t make any friends that night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good old beau . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh raised his brows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re siding with the dog ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in that scenario , yes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was merely protecting emma and noah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tilting her head at him , she added , ` ` besides , i do n ' t like any scenario where you and emma are anything more than friends . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was there in a medical capacity , ' ' he argued . [SEP]
[CLS] she wa ##gged her finger at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you brought dinner with you . [SEP]
[CLS] that fact alone shows you were there for more than just practicing medicine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he quickly pushed her finger down , she gave him a look that was a cross between puzzled and in ##fur ##iated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you trying to silence me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m just helping you save face . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t point - it ' s considered rude . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve done something else wrong now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` next time , you better plan on giving me a crash course in indian culture before you even think about bringing me around your family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] across the table from them , sh ##vet ##a cleared her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh and megan glanced at her , she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re doing fine , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] please do n ' t worry about following all the rules of our culture . [SEP]
[CLS] we certainly do n ' t expect you to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan returned sh ##vet ##a ' s smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i would never dream of doing anything to off ##end you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you would n ' t , ' ' charlie replied . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh did n ' t dare sneak a peek at his mother . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , she was the one who upheld the traditions and customs of their heritage while his father had tried to american ##ize himself as much as possible , right down to changing his name . [SEP]
[CLS] charlie da ##bbed the corners of his mouth with his napkin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand you have a son , megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , mason is almost two . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s my entire world . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should have brought him with you this evening . [SEP]
[CLS] we would have loved to meet him , ' ' sh ##vet ##a said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe next time . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , after you see how much energy he has , you might change your mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the table laughed , she glanced over at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mason truly ad ##ores pe ##sh , and pe ##sh is so good with him . [SEP]
[CLS] his patience is infinite . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s a good boy . [SEP]
[CLS] i enjoy spending time with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so it ' s serious between you two ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , well - ' ' megan began before she was interrupted by the doorbell . [SEP]
[CLS] sanjay rose out of his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that must be dev . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how surprising that he ' s so late ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sh ##vet ##a mused with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh almost laughed at the horrified expression on megan ' s face at the mention of dev . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t tell me he was going to be here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hissed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t sure if he was coming or not . [SEP]
[CLS] but do n ' t worry . [SEP]
[CLS] things are fine between us now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan gave him a skeptical look as dev walked into the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey everybody , ' ' he said , throwing up a hand . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sight of megan sitting next to pe ##sh , dev ' s eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , well , if it is n ' t miss right hook , ' ' he mused with a smirk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s miss left hook , actually , ' ' she corrected . [SEP]
[CLS] dev grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good to know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve met megan , dev ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni asked curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we had the pleasure of meeting each other one day when i went by the hospital to see al ##pes ##h . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at megan ' s sharp intake of breath , dev winked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] he then eased down across from them and began pi ##ling food on his plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you guys work together and now you ' re dating , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking a bite of his sam ##osa , dev motioned at them while he chewed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h is sort of your boss , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could feel megan ' s anger rising . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , actually he is n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a pre ##ce ##pt ##or , or head nurse , who is my boss . [SEP]
[CLS] and before you can make it sound any seed ##ier , it is n ' t against the hospital rules to date each other . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , we met each other long before i started working at wells ##tar . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a slow grin sl ##unk across his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like you , ' ' he said to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have an interesting way of showing it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] charlie chuckled at the head of the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my , my , al ##pes ##h , have n ' t you picked a fei ##sty one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh glanced at megan , who had flushed the red color of her blouse . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave charlie a weak smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i apologize . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a ts ##k , charlie replied , ` ` please do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been rather refreshing to see you putting dev into his well - deserved place . [SEP]
[CLS] i understand you punched him , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when his mother gasped in horror , megan fumbled under the table for pe ##sh ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] he squeezed it reassuring ##ly as she ducked her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , i ' m sorry to say that i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in megan ' s defense , i totally deserved it . [SEP]
[CLS] i punched al ##pes ##h and said some really shitty things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dev ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni cried . [SEP]
[CLS] in true dev fashion , he rolled his eyes at his mother ' s outrage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re fine now . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone calm down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he met pe ##sh ' s gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m happy for you , brother . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve made a good choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cut his eyes over to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you both will be very happy together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev ' s words and his expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev leaned back in his chair , clasp ##ing his hands behind his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and now to ensure that my news overs ##had ##ows any excitement brought on by the two of you , i ' d like to announce that i ' m getting married next month - ' ' lava ##ni once again gasped in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] but dev was n ' t finished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m going to be a father . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s mouth gaped open as the table erupted in absolute pan ##de ##monium . [SEP]
[CLS] he wondered if his mother was going to pass out . [SEP]
[CLS] turning to megan , he found her with her napkin over her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] from the way her shoulders were moving up and down , he could tell she was laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned over to whisper in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess we ' re off the hook , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i think we ' re good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty now that he and megan were an official couple who had said the ` ` l ' ' word , pe ##sh no longer had days off where he had to wonder how to pass the time . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to spend every waking minute with her and with mason , and she always made sure that they had time together . [SEP]
[CLS] today found him at patrick ' s house , wedge ##d on the couch between some of megan ' s male family members . [SEP]
[CLS] just like at his parents , the women were all stationed in the kitchen , putting the finishing touches on sunday lunch . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as becky came in the living room and announced it was time to sit down , there was a stampede to the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] he followed slowly behind the others , searching for megan who he felt like was his life ##line in the crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' s aidan and emma ? [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re never late , ' ' angie remarked , as she sat a giant platt ##er on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] liz shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they have n ' t called . [SEP]
[CLS] we could go ahead and get started , and then they can start when they get here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] john pulled out a chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m starving . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] becky rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re always starving . [SEP]
[CLS] between you and percy , we ' re going to be eaten out of house and home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh hung back as the others started taking their seats at the massive mahogany table . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of how welcoming the fitzgerald ' s had been , he still could n ' t help feeling like an outsider . [SEP]
[CLS] megan came in carrying a plate of ham . [SEP]
[CLS] after she deposited it on the table , her gaze searched the room for him . [SEP]
[CLS] when she spotted him , she gave him the smile that always warmed his heart before crook ##ing her finger at him . [SEP]
[CLS] as he started to join her , mason came running in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get me , es ##h , ' ' he urged , holding his hands up . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh grinned as he st ##ooped over to pick mason up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you hungry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , huh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to sit with me or pe ##sh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` es ##h , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that okay with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll be fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she motioned for him to have a seat . [SEP]
[CLS] just as they sat down , aidan appeared in the doorway of the dining room with noah in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry we ' re late . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' s emma ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , as she took noah from aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] with a grimace , aidan said , ` ` she is n ' t feeling well . [SEP]
[CLS] it seems that with this pregnancy she ' s having third trim ##ester morning sickness . [SEP]
[CLS] i told her i would stay home with her , but she insisted i come get a good meal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` poor thing . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll fix her a plate for you to take home to her later on , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] if she can eat it , i know she ' ll be grateful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] patrick clicked his fork against his water go ##ble ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is everyone here that ' s supposed to be here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a chorus of , ` ` yes , ' ' rang around the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s return thanks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh obe ##die ##ntly bowed his head along with the others . [SEP]
[CLS] when patrick finished , the dishes were passed around and food was served . [SEP]
[CLS] it was certainly a lot different than how his family did it , but he still enjoyed being with megan ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] while mason ate off his plate , megan gave aidan a break by feeding noah , or more appropriately letting him dr ##ape her in food while he fed himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a mess , ' ' megan said , into noah ' s carrot - and - corn crust ##ed face . [SEP]
[CLS] his response was to grin at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , mister , but that cute little grin is n ' t going to work for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s so stubborn , ' ' aidan said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a stubborn fitzgerald ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never heard of such , ' ' becky joked across the table . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m serious . [SEP]
[CLS] he refuses to let me or em feed him , and then he ends up wearing more than he eats . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds like his father , ' ' angie mused . [SEP]
[CLS] when aidan gave her an exasperated look , she said , ` ` you were the exact same way . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think you ate a meal until you were two that mother did n ' t have to hose you off after you finished . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan grunted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t tell em that story . [SEP]
[CLS] she already blame ##s me enough for noah ' s stubborn ##ness . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s hope that this next baby has emma ' s temperament . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like she is n ' t stubborn , ' ' aidan countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` much less than you are , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] pu ##rs ##ing his lips , he appeared to be surveying her words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you might have a point , ' ' he said , with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] after everyone finished eating , the adults lounge ##d around the table talking and laughing while the kids went into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] both mason and noah wanted to go with the bigger kids . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you keep an eye on them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked percy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i owe you , per ##ce , ' ' aidan said , as percy took the boys by the hand . [SEP]
[CLS] as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan ' s chair , pe ##sh enjoyed listening to the lively conversation around him . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally one of aidan ' s sisters would ask him a question or his opinion . [SEP]
[CLS] he had always been naturally quiet , and when he got in the midst of such a lively bunch , he tended to be even quieter . [SEP]
[CLS] he realized if he was going to truly fit in , he was going to have to speak up more . [SEP]
[CLS] their conversation was interrupted by a shriek that came from the living room followed by a loud wai ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan was out of his chair in a flash while megan was close on his heels . [SEP]
[CLS] mason came running into the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` noah got hurt ##ed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan reappeared in the dining room with noah in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] he just fell down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking noah ' s hand , aidan said , ` ` here daddy will kiss the boo ##bo ##os away , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah sniff ##led and bobbed his head . [SEP]
[CLS] once aidan finish with his hand , noah stuck out his leg . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] once he bent down to noah ' s leg and kissed it , he asked , ` ` are you daddy ' s boy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] angie chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not fair to do that when emma is n ' t here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the others laughed , pe ##sh glanced at mason . [SEP]
[CLS] he was staring at aidan and noah with a con ##tem ##pl ##ative look on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] never in a million years could he have imagined what he would do next . [SEP]
[CLS] mason crawled up into his lap and patted pe ##sh ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` es ##h mace ' s daddy . [SEP]
[CLS] mace daddy ' s boy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] conversation in the dining room silenced . [SEP]
[CLS] without even looking up , pe ##sh felt his skin singing under the burn of everyone staring at him and mason . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way he could deny the boy when he wore such an expression of happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you ' re daddy ' s boy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a strangled cry caused him to snap his gaze from mason over to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] wide - eyed and open mouthed , she blinked a few times as if she were trying to believe that what she was seeing was real . [SEP]
[CLS] then without another word , she bolted from her chair and fled the room . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying to decide what to do . [SEP]
[CLS] bending over , he whispered into mason ' s ear , ` ` will you go back and play with the others ? [SEP]
[CLS] i need to check on mommy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when mason nodded , pe ##sh gently sat him back down on the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] after he raced out of the dining room , pe ##sh finally glanced at the others . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , ' ' he said , before rising out of his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] he made his way down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t have to look hard for megan - she was in the one bedroom with the door closed . [SEP]
[CLS] he rap ##ped lightly on the wood . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did n ' t answer , he went ahead and opened the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he went over and sat down next to her . [SEP]
[CLS] tentatively , he put his hand on her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry for not setting mason straight and telling him i was n ' t his daddy . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked so happy , and i did n ' t want to hurt him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with her elbows braced on her knees , megan turned her head to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] tears streamed down her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think i ' m angry at you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] she hi ##cc ##uppe ##d a cry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh pe ##sh , you ' re so naive sometimes ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he jerked back at her words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just when i think i ca n ' t love you more , you go and do something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before he could process her words , she threw herself at him , kissing his cheeks and mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] she st ##rad ##dled his lap and brought her hands around his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really love mason , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could see yourself really being a father to him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i could . [SEP]
[CLS] but what - ' ' she silenced him with a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] it was one that was laced with desperate emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrapped his hands around her waist and drew her closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] just as he was about to deep ##en the kiss , she pulled away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you love me too , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should have no doubts on that one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you love me enough to be a husband to me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her question caused him to suck in a harsh breath . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt like he had been kicked in the gut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i could - i always have . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tilted her head at him and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then marry me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bringing her lips to his , she murmured against his mouth , ` ` marry me . [SEP]
[CLS] make me your wife . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment , he thanked god he was sitting down because if he had n ' t been , he was pretty sure he would ' ve done something totally em ##as ##cula ##ting like faint ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] he also questioned both his hearing and his sanity . [SEP]
[CLS] had megan just proposed to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] surely , he was hall ##uc ##inating . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you just ask me to marry you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned lame ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] giggling , megan nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish you could see your face right now . [SEP]
[CLS] i should be insulted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just you surprised me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cupped his face in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i do n ' t have a ring , and i did n ' t get down on one knee , ' ' she loving ##ly teased . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his hands up to touch hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re really serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bowing his head , he tenderly kissed the tops of her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you so much , megan , and i want nothing more than to make you my wife . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so is that a yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want to make sure you know what you ' re saying . [SEP]
[CLS] one minute you ' re in the dining room , laughing with your family , and then the next you ' re in here weeping and then proposing to me . [SEP]
[CLS] and let ' s not forget how adamant you have been the entire time i ' ve known you about being too young to get married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s lips turned down in a po ##ut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ca n ' t a girl change her mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , of course , but i just want to make sure this is really what you want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tears sparkled in her blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are everything i could ever want in a man . [SEP]
[CLS] you love me , you watch out for me , you want the best for me . [SEP]
[CLS] while that would be enough to make me want to marry you , you love my son . [SEP]
[CLS] you watch out for him and you want the best for him . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t ever imagine loving someone more than i do you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t imagine wanting to be anyone else ' s wife but you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sniff ##led . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was so stupid for so long . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t believe that someone like me could truly deserve someone like you . [SEP]
[CLS] but you never gave up on me . [SEP]
[CLS] if you give me the chance , i ' ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh could n ' t stop the racing of his heart . [SEP]
[CLS] he was sure both his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] he cupped her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to get married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so we ' re engaged ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when a smile lit up megan ' s face , he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but not formally yet . [SEP]
[CLS] not until i put a diamond on your hand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do n ' t need that to know i ' m promised to you and that we ' re getting married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe you do n ' t , but i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll let you buy me a diamond . [SEP]
[CLS] a great big one , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise to spend a fortune . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i would be happy to wear your ring even if it was a little chip . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you would . [SEP]
[CLS] but i want to spoil my beautiful future wife . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i wo n ' t argue with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh brought his mouth to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] as their lips moved against each other , he could n ' t believe how lucky he was . [SEP]
[CLS] megan was his - she was really going to be his for the rest of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] when she flicked her tongue against his , he groaned into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] considering they were at patrick ' s with all of her family down the hall , he knew the last thing on his mind should ' ve been flipping her over onto her back and pounding into her . [SEP]
[CLS] but he did n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted inside her body . [SEP]
[CLS] he had finally made it into her heart , mind , and soul , and he once again wanted to be inside her perfection . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan pushed him onto his back , pe ##sh raised his brows at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , i think my future wife is getting ahead of herself . [SEP]
[CLS] usually the con ##sum ##mat ##ing comes after the wedding , not the engagement , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we ' ve con ##sum ##mate ##d enough over the last few months where it does n ' t matter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose you ' re right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she ground her core against his growing erection , she said , ` ` looks like i ' m not the only one with con ##sum ##mat ##ing on the mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should know that has a mind of its own . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grinned down at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , right now i think we ' re both of the same mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she continued to grind against him , his hands swept to her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] he cupped and kn ##ead ##ed the flesh over her top . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of the door opening , pe ##sh tried to pull away , but he did n ' t make it in time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh f * * king hell ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s voice boomed from the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] megan quickly scrambled off pe ##sh , and they both rose up , trying to straighten their clothes and hair . [SEP]
[CLS] with a pained expression , aidan said , ` ` seriously ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is my old bedroom ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , but you of all people should understand that when the mood hits , you act on it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smacked his arm playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is not exactly what happened . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] holding up one of his hands , aidan said , ` ` frankly , i do n ' t really want to know what happened . [SEP]
[CLS] i just came back here to make sure megan was all right . [SEP]
[CLS] next time , i ' ll make sure someone else comes , so i do n ' t need eye b ##lea ##ch to wipe that out of my memory . ` ` [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ha , ha , very funny , ' ' megan grumbled , as she got off the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were only celebrating , ' ' pe ##sh said . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan pinched his eyes shut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i even want to know what you were celebrating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our engagement , per ##vert , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s blue eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holy shit , you two are engaged ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled as he rose off the bed and took megan ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , we are . [SEP]
[CLS] well , i mean , i need to go to her father and properly ask for her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] and there ' s the fact she does n ' t have a ring . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] shaking his head in disbelief , aidan said , ` ` that ' s . . . wow . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so happy for you two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] and i do mean that . [SEP]
[CLS] if it were n ' t for you and emma , i never would have met megan , ' ' pe ##sh said . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan grinned as he clapped pe ##sh on the back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re more than welcome , man . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just so glad you two finally realized how good you were for each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned back to the door before motion ##ing them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , let ' s go tell the others . [SEP]
[CLS] i think this calls for a celebration , but just not the kind that you two were part ##aking in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were n ' t going to tell anybody yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she does n ' t even have a ring . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan snorted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you really think anyone out there is going to give two shit ##s about whether or not you have a ring ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we just want to do it the right way , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] holding up his hands in surrender , aidan said , ` ` all right , i ' m not going to argue with you anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] but i will say that there is no right way . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , look at me and em . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , you have to go with the flow and appreciate the moments that are bigger than you could ever imagine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he then turned and strode out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh stole a glance at megan who appeared to be processing aidan ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , we better get back out there before they send someone else , ' ' she finally said . [SEP]
[CLS] with a smile , he took her hand and led her down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] when they got back to the dining room , everyone glanced expect ##antly at them . [SEP]
[CLS] even though he knew he should n ' t , pe ##sh blurted , ` ` we ' re engaged ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t have time to worry about megan ' s anger about him b ##lab ##bing because he realized she had said it at the same time he had . [SEP]
[CLS] cheers went up over the room , and he was hugged and kissed by megan ' s aunt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan ' s father , paul , stood before him , pe ##sh felt like he ' d been kicked in the groin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mr . mckenzie , i apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] i intended to come to you and ask for megan ' s hand - to show respect to you and your wife . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] paul shook his head and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just grateful that she ' s met such a wonderful man who will be a good husband to her and a good father to mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i swear to you that i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he and paul shook hands to seal the vow . [SEP]
[CLS] in the absence of champagne , wine was poured to celebrate . [SEP]
[CLS] at the head of the table , patrick held up his glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to my granddaughter and the good doctor , i give you an irish marriage blessing . [SEP]
[CLS] ' may god be with you and bless you . [SEP]
[CLS] may you see your children ' s children . [SEP]
[CLS] may you be poor in mis ##fort ##unes and rich in blessings . [SEP]
[CLS] may you know nothing but happiness from this day forward . ' ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to megan and pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the others raised their glasses . [SEP]
[CLS] once pe ##sh tasted the rich bouquet of the wine , he leaned over and kissed megan . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even mind the cat - calls and whistling - he was too happy to care . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - one standing in front of the lighted hotel mirror , megan sur ##mise ##d her appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first time she had n ' t been encircled by pe ##sh ' s mother , sister , and aunt ##s since she had stepped inside the suite an hour ago . [SEP]
[CLS] when she had agreed to an indian engagement party , she had n ' t quite known what she was getting into . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought it would just be a great way to get their friends and family together . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know that pe ##sh ' s family did n ' t do anything on a modest scale . [SEP]
[CLS] without her input , the plaza ballroom of the ri ##tz carlton in atlanta had been booked . [SEP]
[CLS] when she had dared a peek inside earlier , it had been transformed into something out of a bollywood movie . [SEP]
[CLS] she had wanted to honor pe ##sh ' s culture by dressing just as a true indian prospective bride would , so she had gone sar ##i shopping with lava ##ni and sh ##vet ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] what she had n ' t bet on was how gorgeous ##ly intricate the outfit would be . [SEP]
[CLS] now as she gazed at herself in the mirror , she was almost blinded by the glittering stones and bea ##ding on the deep purple and gold sar ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the outfit put even the b ##ling ##iest miss america pageant dress to shame . [SEP]
[CLS] the top part was sleeve ##less , and it ended just below her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] while the front part appeared to be plain satin , the back was en ##cr ##ust ##ed in bea ##ding and gems . [SEP]
[CLS] the skirt , with its bea ##ded waistband , started just beneath her belly button and fell to the floor in the most exquisite silky material . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hard imagining she was going to be bari ##ng her mid - drift , as was the fashion of the sar ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she had a jewel en ##cr ##ust ##ed dr ##ape that slung across one of her shoulders and down one side . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier after one of pe ##sh ' s aunt ##s had done her makeup , lava ##ni and sh ##vet ##a did her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] the long strands were swept back and pinned on the side in loose curls . [SEP]
[CLS] a gorgeous purple orchid adorned the curls . [SEP]
[CLS] all that was missing from her ensemble was the jewelry that pe ##sh ' s family had requested that she wear . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently , it was all heir ##lo ##om pieces and kept in a safe at a bank . [SEP]
[CLS] although the necklace and earrings were to come , her arms were heavy laden with bang ##le bracelet ##s that lava ##ni and sh ##vet ##a had put on her . [SEP]
[CLS] they both had tears in their eyes when they finished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look absolutely breath ##taking , my dear , ' ' lava ##ni said . [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] and thank you so much for making tonight happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni cupped her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i look forward to seeing many happy years between you and my al ##pes ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m grateful that you make him so happy . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been so long since i had seen a light in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] but when you came into his life , you brought back that light . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at lava ##ni ' s words , megan felt tears stinging her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt like she could speak without crying , she brought her hands together as if she were praying and then bowed her head as was the sign of respect in pe ##sh ' s culture . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to know that before pe ##sh , i was in darkness , too . [SEP]
[CLS] he has become my light as well . [SEP]
[CLS] i can assure you that i will spend the rest of my life honoring him and making him happy . [SEP]
[CLS] i am very thankful for the amazing man you have raised . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lava ##ni ' s dark eyes filled with tears , and she brought a handkerchief up to da ##b her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , my dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sh ##vet ##a stepped into the bathroom , her face lit up in a broad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h is here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] gathering up the bottom of her skirt , megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart stopped at the sight of him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had never seen him in kurt ##a - pa ##ja ##ma , as they were called . [SEP]
[CLS] basically , it was a long , tunic like shirt that came to his knees . [SEP]
[CLS] underneath he wore loose cotton - like pants . [SEP]
[CLS] but his top was made much like hers . [SEP]
[CLS] it was gold in color and en ##cr ##ust ##ed in gems and bea ##ding . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to begin to imagine how much it cost . [SEP]
[CLS] when she brought her gaze back to his , she shivered under his heated stare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are a vision of absolute and total perfection , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] doing a little turn , the fabric of her sar ##i t ##wi ##rled around her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you like it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel a little like a pose ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] like ' you can put the irish girl in a sar ##i , but you ca n ' t take the irish out of the girl ' kinda thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would n ' t have you any other way , ' ' he said , with a serious , yet tender tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan eyed the two velvet boxes in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##oh , let me see the good ##ies . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a bark of a laugh , pe ##sh sat one of the boxes down on the table before he opened the other . [SEP]
[CLS] megan gasped as two enormous earrings glitter ##ed back at her . [SEP]
[CLS] while there was a thick base , the rest flowed down in flourishing designs that would probably touch her shoulders when she put them on . [SEP]
[CLS] they had a gold over ##lay ##ing , but all the gems were diamonds and am ##eth ##yst ##s that would match her sar ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is why your mother and sh ##vet ##a wanted me to pick a purple sar ##i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re breath ##taking , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait until you see the necklace , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] her shaky hands reached forward to take one of the earrings . [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly worked the clasp and fastened it to her lobe . [SEP]
[CLS] then she did the other . [SEP]
[CLS] while they were so heavy she felt like they might weigh her down , she glanced up at pe ##sh and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached for the other box . [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s eyes widened as the diamonds and deep am ##eth ##yst ##s sparkled in the light . [SEP]
[CLS] he took the necklace out and un ##fast ##ened the clasp . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved behind her and then lifted the necklace over her head . [SEP]
[CLS] she closed her eyes at the pleas ##urable sensation of feeling his closeness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there . [SEP]
[CLS] now you ' re ready . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] w ##hir ##ling around to face him , she brought her lips to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb tenderly rubbed her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] from the doorway of the bedroom , lava ##ni ts ##ked di ##sa ##pp ##roving ##ly at them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` al ##pes ##h , stop ma ##ulin ##g her , or you ' re going to mess up her makeup ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hardly think i was ma ##ulin ##g her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she waved her hand dismiss ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come now . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s time we went downstairs . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after pe ##sh held out his arm for her , megan slid hers through his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be nervous , ' ' he murmured into her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not , ' ' she lied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan , i know you well enough by now that i know when you ' re nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] you fi ##dget and bite your lip . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' she muttered , as they got onto the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] considering it was packed with pe ##sh ' s family , megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing she wanted to do was to come off wrong in front of them . [SEP]
[CLS] when the doors opened , she drew in a couple of deep breaths to still her nerves . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a whole lot of po ##mp and circumstance that she did n ' t quite understand about how they were all supposed to enter . [SEP]
[CLS] she just tried not to mess up the part when she came in with her parents . [SEP]
[CLS] just like at a wedding reception , she and pe ##sh sat at a table at the head of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , she had n ' t quite prepared herself for the golden chairs that looked almost like throne ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] once everyone was assembled , pe ##sh ' s father got up to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are very grateful that you all could be with us this evening . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that with megan ' s friends and family , as well as some of our son ' s , there are a lot of you una ##c ##qua ##int ##ed with our culture . [SEP]
[CLS] i will try to explain to you what the proceedings are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] on the table in front of them were two flower wreath ##s that reminded her of the lei ##s that you would see in hawaii . [SEP]
[CLS] they were in colors of white , gold , and purple . [SEP]
[CLS] the wreath ##s cr ##iss ##cross ##ed over the black ring boxes . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew from what pe ##sh had told her that they would be giving each other rings tonight to symbol ##ize their future union . [SEP]
[CLS] it all seemed pretty extreme to her for just an engagement party - it was almost like a wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s show - time , ' ' pe ##sh murmured in her ear before he stood up . [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly followed his lead . [SEP]
[CLS] he took one of the flower wreath ##s off the table and brought it over her head . [SEP]
[CLS] he made sure to adjust her hair so it flowed over the flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was done , she did the same , although it was a little harder for her to reach up over his head . [SEP]
[CLS] then he took one of the platinum bands and put it on her trembling finger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you so very much , megan . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s not another woman in the world i could love like i do you , ' ' he whispered to reassure her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you so much , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she then slid the band on his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] once it was done , applause went out over the ballroom , and pe ##sh pulled her to him for a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now what do we do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we dance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after ex ##haling the breath she had been holding , megan took pe ##sh ' s hand and let him lead her to the dance floor . [SEP]
[CLS] a song she had never heard before in her life began to play from the dj . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what were you thinking when it came to the wedding ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something small . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his brows rose in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i was thinking you would want to go all out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want something simple with our closest friends and family . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have to have something show ##y to make me happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know that anything ' simple ' is not going to set well with my parents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , they ' re just going to have to accept it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we could just run off and get married in a cave in hawaii , ' ' he suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that idea has potential , but i think as my parents ' only daughter , they would kill me if they did n ' t get to plan something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his expression grew serious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want us to have to wait much longer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i agree . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to get married in the next couple of months . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan glanced over to see her grandfather dancing with his lady friend , an idea popped into her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if we got married in papa ' s rose garden ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it sounds like a beautiful place , but is there enough room ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only our closest friends and family , remember ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she insisted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it could work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you like the idea ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , he said , ` ` it makes sense considering you proposed to me at patrick ' s house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] it does . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` think we can put it all together in two months ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t see why not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his warm lips to hers , and megan shivered in spite of the heat on the dance floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t wait to make you my wife , ' ' he murmured against her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m ready to make an honest man out of you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh threw his head back and chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only you would say something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , the truth is the truth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the song ended , and pe ##sh escorted her back to their table . [SEP]
[CLS] after they finished with the blessings from pe ##sh ' s family , dinner was served . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t believe all the food that was parade ##d by her . [SEP]
[CLS] she lost count on how many plates of delicious indian food she sampled . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the dessert ##s came out , she was thoroughly stuffed and could n ' t eat any . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go ming ##le , ' ' she suggested when pe ##sh also turned down any dessert . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good to me , ' ' he said , before getting out of his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] they made their way through the maze of tables , talking to family and friends . [SEP]
[CLS] megan was introduced to so many of pe ##sh ' s relatives that she was sure she would never be able to remember them all . [SEP]
[CLS] when they finally got to the fitzgerald tables filled with her parents and aunt ##s and uncles , she was thrilled when pe ##sh took a seat across from aidan and emma . [SEP]
[CLS] after they had been talking for a while , emma turned aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think noah ' s okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine , babe . [SEP]
[CLS] the sit ##ter looked very qualified . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] although emma nodded her head , megan could tell that she was n ' t convinced . [SEP]
[CLS] both mason and noah were upstairs in the hotel with baby ##sit ##ters outside of their family for the first time in their young lives . [SEP]
[CLS] megan shared a bit of emma ' s apprehension , but when she had dropped mason off in the suite , he seemed to get along with the woman they had hired . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i might just go peek in on him . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , make sure she got him to sleep , ' ' emma said , rising out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan shook his head and stood up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need to be off your feet . [SEP]
[CLS] you said yourself you were n ' t feeling too well before we left . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma shot him a murderous look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks for saying that in front of pe ##sh and megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan gave them a sheep ##ish grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry guys . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope it does n ' t ruin your fabulous party knowing that emma , at nine months pregnant and some change , was n ' t feeling wonderful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed while pe ##sh shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma , if you want to go on upstairs and lie down , we wo n ' t be hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] i remember how awful it feels being over ##due , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to stay , ' ' emma replied . [SEP]
[CLS] when aidan motioned for her to have a seat , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to go to the restroom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want me to go check on noah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure he ' s fine or the sit ##ter would have texted me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just being over ##pro ##tec ##tive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan gave her a quick kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` love you , sweetheart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after she headed through the crowd to the bathroom , aidan began telling pe ##sh some wild story from work that had pe ##sh doubled over with laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] when emma returned , she did n ' t sit back down . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she swayed back and forth on her feet next to her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aidan , ' ' she said in a strained voice . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could n ' t help noticing how emma had pale ##d considerably since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes before . [SEP]
[CLS] he held up his finger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one second , babe . [SEP]
[CLS] i got ta finish telling pe ##sh this story . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but my water broke . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without taking his eyes off pe ##sh , aidan slid his glass of water over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here take mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if the situation had n ' t been dire , megan would have laughed at how oblivious aidan was . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh leaned forward in his seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , aidan , i think - ' ' he did n ' t get a chance to finish . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , water splashed against the side of aidan ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] he shot out of his chair before w ##hir ##ling around to emma . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell , em ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my . [SEP]
[CLS] water . [SEP]
[CLS] broke , ' ' she muttered through gritted teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh shit , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] after tossing his napkin back on the table , he held up a hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , it ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] no need to panic . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re not that far from the hospital - ' ' ` ` like twenty minutes , ' ' emma argued . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s hands came to her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' ll be fine , babe . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma huffed out a few frustrated breaths as she weighed his words . [SEP]
[CLS] then her grim expression softened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan grinned as he turned back to pe ##sh and megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hate to cut and run , but it looks like baby caroline is a big attention whore who wants all the glory tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan rose out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you worry about it one bit . [SEP]
[CLS] since she ' s a week over ##due , i ' m going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the lime ##light . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can we do anything ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] while aidan shook his head , emma said , ` ` just make sure noah is okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] angie rose out of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go check on him right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan dug around in his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] when he produced a set of keys , he tossed them at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since i came after work , em and i are in separate cars . [SEP]
[CLS] whoever has noah overnight will need our suv to get him to the hospital tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded as megan said , ` ` good thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure if mom is taking him or becky . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at emma ' s somewhat app ##re ##hen ##sive look that there was n ' t a strict plan in place for noah , megan said , ` ` it ' ll be fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , ' ' she said , a little reluctantly . [SEP]
[CLS] sliding his arm around emma ' s waist , aidan said , ` ` come on , sweetheart . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at the feel of pe ##sh ' s hand on her back , megan glanced up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exciting night for them , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about letting me take you for another spin on the dance floor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d love that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as an indian love song flowed out from the speakers , megan wrapped her arms around pe ##sh ' s neck . [SEP]
[CLS] this time he did n ' t bother dancing more formally like he had in savannah . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her flush against him . [SEP]
[CLS] closing her eyes , she rested her head on his broad chest , loving the gentle beat of his heart beneath his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] when the song finished , they did n ' t move . [SEP]
[CLS] they just waited for the next one . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , it was another slow one . [SEP]
[CLS] halfway through , she felt a tug on the bottom of her dr ##ape . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing down , she saw georgie peering up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing , sweetie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced left and right before he spoke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mommy told me not to tell anybody , but she needs you to come up to her hotel room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] what for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` noah ' s going crazy wanting aunt emma , and she thinks you ' re the only one that might be able to get him to calm down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she turned back to pe ##sh , he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t even need to apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] go see if you can help . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned up and gave him a smack ##ing kiss on the lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for being so amazing each and every moment of the day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb brushed against her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be back as soon as i can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to hold you to that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking georgie ' s hand , she made her way off the dance floor and out of the ballroom . [SEP]
[CLS] after getting on one of the elevators , they rode to the sixth floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she let georgie lead the way . [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped halfway down the hall and knocked on the door . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , she did n ' t have to guess which room noah was in . [SEP]
[CLS] she could hear his screams all the way outside . [SEP]
[CLS] when becky flung open the door , she waved megan through with her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the others did n ' t want me to interrupt you , but we ' ve been trying the last hour to get him to calm down , and he ' s just not having it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan found the scene in hotel room somewhat comical . [SEP]
[CLS] her mother , along with her aunt ##s julia and liz , stood in a circle around one of the beds . [SEP]
[CLS] outfit ##ted in a fuzzy , blue footed sleeper , noah sat in the middle of the mattress , his cheeks streaked and soaked with tears and his face red from crying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is the matter ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone whirled around to look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] everything ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] go back to your party , ' ' angie said , over noah ' s wai ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , i think it ' s safe to say that it is n ' t fine . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , he ' s not fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] liz fan ##ned her face with her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s like the moment emma left the hotel , he freaked out . [SEP]
[CLS] he woke up out of a dead sleep screaming for his mama . [SEP]
[CLS] the poor baby - sit ##ter hung in as long as she could before she finally called us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cocked her head at noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` poor thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bypassed her aunt ##s to hold out her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] considering he ' d spent so much time with her , noah happily reached for her , and megan pulled him into her embrace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey buddy , you ' ve got to stop crying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was s ##nu ##bbing so hard his breath came in big hi ##cc ##ups as his chest heaved . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mama . [SEP]
[CLS] want mama , ' ' he pleaded pit ##iful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] megan hugged him tight to her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , sweetie . [SEP]
[CLS] but she ' s at the hospital having your baby sister . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her answer did n ' t satisfy him since he drew in a deep breath to start screaming again . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wan na go downstairs to the party ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he appeared thoughtful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pe ##sh is downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] you wan na see him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` es ##h ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he ' s down there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see es ##h , ' ' he said , kicking his feet as if to tell her to start walking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll take him , ' ' her mother suggested , reaching for noah . [SEP]
[CLS] he shrieked before wrapping his arms tighter around megan ' s neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think it ' s safe to say he ' s staying with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it ' s your engagement party , ' ' julia protested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , and i ' ve been enjoying it the last four hours . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think watching him is going to take away anything for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she started out the doorway , she asked , ` ` is mason okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her mother nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank goodness he ' s down the hall , or we ' d have two todd ##lers running around at eleven o ' clock . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan giggled as she walked down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] her necklace and the bea ##ded sar ##i seemed to be holding noah ' s interest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pretty , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , as they got on the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##oh , p ##we ##tty , ' ' he mimic ##ked . [SEP]
[CLS] when she got back downstairs , pe ##sh was seated at their table , talking to some of their colleagues . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment noah saw him , he reached out for pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well hello , little one . [SEP]
[CLS] were you really crying because you wanted to come to our party ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah grinned at pe ##sh behind his pac ##ifier , which caused pe ##sh to smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he looks so much like aidan when he does that , does n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he does . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure he ' s going to use that cute little grin to his advantage when he gets older , just like his daddy did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she eased into the chair beside them . [SEP]
[CLS] after spitting out his pac ##ifier , noah asked , ` ` daddy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , oh , i should n ' t have said that , ' ' megan muttered under her breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my daddy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s at the hospital with mommy . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll take you there in the morning , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] that statement caused noah ' s lip to tremble . [SEP]
[CLS] before he could start crying , pe ##sh rose out of his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go look at all the pretty party decorations . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled as she watched pe ##sh take noah around the room . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart warmed at his thoughtful ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe there was ever a time when she fought her feelings for him . [SEP]
[CLS] there was n ' t a better man in the whole world , and the fact that he loved her was a true miracle . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time pe ##sh returned , noah had fallen asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] he carefully sat back down beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , ' ' she suggested , taking off her glittering dr ##ape . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrapped the fabric over noah like a blanket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did i mention how much i loved you in a sar ##i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh questioned , with a wicked gleam in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced down to see the top had her boo ##bs bulging out the front as well as the fact her stomach was now bared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have to wear one more often for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would love that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when her phone bee ##ped , she reached across the table and grabbed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] the baby is already here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` considering it ' s a second baby , it is n ' t too surprising . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to tell my mom and aunt ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled at noah sleeping sound ##ly against pe ##sh ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be right back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she made her way over to her family ' s table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] caroline was just born . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a who ##op went up around the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is emma okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] becky asked . [SEP]
[CLS] megan nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he said mother and baby are doing great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] julia shook her head and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aidan with a daughter - now that ' s going to be something to see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they all laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s so true , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] becky glanced at the group . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we go see them ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , the hospital is n ' t too far from here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] angie nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d personally like to see aidan in action with his baby girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a snort , megan added , ` ` i would have liked to have been in the delivery room when she was first born . [SEP]
[CLS] his expression then would have been price ##less . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bet he cried , ' ' liz said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah , he ba ##wled for sure , ' ' angie replied , with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] as her aunt ##s started gathering up their purse ##s and telling their husbands where they were going , megan said , ` ` i want to go too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before they could argue , she held up her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s late . [SEP]
[CLS] the party is pretty much over , and there ' s two more next week at some of pe ##sh ' s relatives ' houses . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i want to see the newest fitzgerald baby girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her mother frowned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m positive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right . [SEP]
[CLS] go tell pe ##sh , and we ' ll meet you out front . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled as she went back to their table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mom and aunt ##s are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want to go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her heart warmed at the fact that he already knew what she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not . [SEP]
[CLS] can i go too or is this just a hen party thing for the women ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you can come . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh glanced down at noah . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s going to want to see his mother . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think we could go without him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as pe ##sh rose out of the chair , noah stirred but did n ' t wake up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get aidan and emma ' s keys out of my pocket . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded and reached into his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] when she accidentally touched his penis through the fabric , he jumped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about that , ' ' she replied , as she pulled out the keys . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problem , ' ' he muttered through gritted teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] they said a quick goodnight to pe ##sh ' s parents and other relatives who remained . [SEP]
[CLS] then they headed out to the lobby . [SEP]
[CLS] after giving the valet aidan ' s keys , they waited for the suv to be brought around . [SEP]
[CLS] when she caught her reflection in the glass doors of the hotel , she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh inquired . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the jewelry ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t go loaded down with this expensive stuff to the hospital ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried . [SEP]
[CLS] she snatched off the earrings and then started working on the necklace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll run go give it to your mother . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you insist , ' ' pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she kicked off her heels so she could run easier . [SEP]
[CLS] the necklace and earrings weighed down her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed the first member of pe ##sh ' s immediate family she saw , which unfortunately happened to be dev . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you get these to your mother ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve got to get to the hospital . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his dark eyes widened as he took the jewelry from her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . [SEP]
[CLS] a cousin ' s baby was just born . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t let anything happen to that , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dev chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i ' ll be un ##loading this pro ##nto . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing i need is for my ass to be the one to lose the family jewels . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , he added , ` ` they ' d be taking my family jewels . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed and then gave him a wave before running off . [SEP]
[CLS] when she got back outside , aidan and emma ' s suv had just pulled around . [SEP]
[CLS] noah began to sq ##ui ##rm in pe ##sh ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess where we ' re going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh said , before he could start crying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mama ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , we ' re taking you to your mama and daddy and new baby sister . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah ' s face lit up at the prospect , and he happily let them buckle him into his car seat . [SEP]
[CLS] following her mother ' s car , they made the drive in almost a caravan of relatives . [SEP]
[CLS] when they got to the hospital , pe ##sh pulled up to let her out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll go park and bring him in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you guys up there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she got up to the maternity floor , there was a quite a group waiting for her , including emma ' s best friend , connor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did casey not feel like coming tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked , as she hugged him . [SEP]
[CLS] casey was just a few weeks shy of her own due date with a little girl . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , she ' s here all right . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s just in labor herself . [SEP]
[CLS] it seems like caroline and olivia are going to be true best friends by being born almost the same day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s wonderful news . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] connor wrinkled his nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think casey will be app ##re ##cia ##ting it a little more when her ep ##id ##ural kicks in . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t too happy the last time i went back to see her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes , i remember that feeling well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s phone ding ##ed , and she quickly read the text . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aidan says we can come back now , ' ' she said to her aunt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the group made their way through the double doors and down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] when they reached emma ' s room , angie knocked on the door . [SEP]
[CLS] within a few seconds , aidan appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey guys , ' ' he said , with a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the nurse is actually checking on em , but give me a second . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he disappeared back behind the door only to re ##app ##ear within a few moments . [SEP]
[CLS] this time he held a tiny bundle wrapped in a pink blanket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here she is . [SEP]
[CLS] miss caroline elizabeth fitzgerald . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] collective o ##oh ##s and aa ##hs went up over the group as aidan held caroline out for them to see . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t seem too interested or impressed by them . [SEP]
[CLS] she yawned and closed her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s absolutely beautiful , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s something all right , ' ' aidan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there it is ! [SEP]
[CLS] i see a tear , ' ' becky teased . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan rolled his eyes at his sister . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me guess . [SEP]
[CLS] you had some kind of bet going about whether i cried or not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] liz patted his back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh appeared then . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment noah saw his father he kicked to get down . [SEP]
[CLS] once he got his feet on the floor , he ran to aidan , wrapping his arms around aidan ' s leg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey buddy . [SEP]
[CLS] you want to meet your sister ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] squat ##ting down , aidan held caroline to where noah could get a good look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mama ' s tu ##mmy baby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , this is your baby sister , caroline . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah eyed his sister with a slight frown , as if he was trying to figure her out . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d spent the last sixteen months being the center of his parents ' world , and now there was someone else to share the attention . [SEP]
[CLS] when caroline sc ##run ##ched up her face and whimpered , noah patted her arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no cw ##y , baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aw , he ' s going to be a good big brother , ' ' angie remarked . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , he ' ll be fine until caroline needs emma . [SEP]
[CLS] then he ' s going to be ready to sell her to the g ##yp ##sies . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a nurse exited emma ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can go in now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as she gazed around the crowd , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , some of you can go in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rising up off the floor , aidan took noah ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , buddy . [SEP]
[CLS] mama wants to see you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] noah did n ' t bother waiting on aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] he barrel ##ed through the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mama ! [SEP]
[CLS] mama ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cried . [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled as she watched him climb up on emma ' s bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s my baby boy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma cried hoarse ##ly , sm ##oth ##ering both his cheeks in kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] he snuggled up to emma ' s side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , meg ##gie . [SEP]
[CLS] you and pe ##sh come in first , ' ' aidan suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] megan did n ' t argue with him . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she took pe ##sh ' s hand and followed aidan inside . [SEP]
[CLS] emma glanced up and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry for ruining your engagement party . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t ruin our night , ' ' pe ##sh reassured her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] we kept right on party ##ing - it did n ' t bother us at all , ' ' megan teased . [SEP]
[CLS] emma laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled and jerked her chin over at aidan , who sat in the rocker with caroline . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` congratulations on a beautiful baby girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' emma replied , as a beaming smile lit up her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you feeling okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] emma nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was a little easier this time and a lot quicker . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and this time i did n ' t have to worry that aidan might not make it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you just kept screaming at me to drive faster because you were not going to deliver caroline on the side of the interstate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma ' s cheeks flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i was a little panicked . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh took megan ' s hand and squeezed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we better go and let the others have a turn , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want us to take noah back with us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] considering he was plastered to his mother ' s side , megan was n ' t really looking forward to trying to take him . [SEP]
[CLS] emma gazed down at her son with love burning in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i think he can stay here with us a little longer . [SEP]
[CLS] i might get connor to take him home . [SEP]
[CLS] i know he ' ll be here until casey delivers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure you wo n ' t need your rest ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' ll pawn him off to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until miss caroline needs me , ' ' emma replied , with a sly smile . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan did n ' t argue with her . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked perfectly content to lose sleep if it meant being surrounded by his wife and children . [SEP]
[CLS] after exchanging a few hugs and kisses , she and pe ##sh headed out into the hallway and let the next group in . [SEP]
[CLS] as they walked down the hall hand in hand , pe ##sh turned to her and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i never thought i would see the day i would be en ##vious of aidan again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he heaved a sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seeing him with his children makes me en ##vious . [SEP]
[CLS] one day i hope that ' s you with my child in your arms . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] whether or not they would have children together had never really been discussed . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost a given that they would , so it did n ' t seem necessary to iron out when and how many . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted nothing more than to give pe ##sh a baby of his own . [SEP]
[CLS] he was truly the father mason had never had . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me a year , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] his brows furrowed in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like one year for us to be together as a married couple before we try to have children . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that only makes me an even older father , ' ' he protested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll be fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re awful ##ly sp ##ry for your old age . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just do n ' t want to be on a walker at his or her high school graduation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smacked his arm playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one year is not going to make that much a difference . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you win . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll wait one year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the elevator doors ding ##ed open , they stepped inside . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing down at her , pe ##sh said , ` ` i could n ' t have picked a more amazing mother for my future children . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i got ta agree that you did good , nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] real good , ' ' she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a lingering kiss that silenced anymore of her comeback ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled away , she smiled at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` keep kissing me like that , and i might decide to wait even longer for a baby . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll make me want you , your lips , and your dick all to myself for as long as possible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here i thought my kisses might get you in the mood for baby - making , ' ' pe ##sh mused . [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` either way , it ' s a win - win situation . [SEP]
[CLS] so bring it on , nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] bring . [SEP]
[CLS] it . [SEP]
[CLS] on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - two although her stomach screamed in protest to drop her fork , megan could n ' t resist popping in the last bite of delicious cr ##ep ##e into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] as she chewed , she closed her eyes at the delicious combination of chocolate and straw ##berries danced along her taste buds . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a voice asked from across the table . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyelids popped open to take in pe ##sh , her new husband of three days . [SEP]
[CLS] he wore an amused smile as he held his cap ##pu ##cci ##no cup in mid ##air . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` orgasm ##ically good , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you ' re enjoying them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to gain ten pounds while we ' re here , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] as she da ##bbed her mouth with her napkin , she sighed with absolute content ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] gazing around the tiny parisian cafe , she fought the urge to pinch herself . [SEP]
[CLS] was she actually in paris on her honeymoon ? [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh had asked her where she wanted to go , there was only one place . [SEP]
[CLS] although it was somewhat cl ##iche ##d for a honeymoon destination , she had always wanted to see the city . [SEP]
[CLS] and because she was marrying a man who loved to spoil her , pe ##sh had booked them for a week ' s stay at the hotel plaza at ##hen ##ee . [SEP]
[CLS] not only had he chosen the hotel for its gorgeous views of the e ##iff ##el tower , but it was also where carrie bradshaw stayed when she was in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] it seems pe ##sh completely understood megan ' s love for sex and the city . [SEP]
[CLS] their first day in the city had been spent in their hotel room . [SEP]
[CLS] a combination of jet ##lag and lust had kept them na * * d and in bed , stopping only for room service and showers . [SEP]
[CLS] today they had pri ##ed themselves away from the room to go sights ##ee ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ready to go back to the hotel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a teasing grin , she asked , ` ` are you tired and want to rest ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] desire poole ##d in pe ##sh ' s dark eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t want to rest . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you to model what you bought this afternoon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her gaze left his to go down to the pink and black bag at her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] part of their sights ##ee ##ing had turned into shopping , in which she bought some very ra ##cy linger ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] although she was enjoying her day out in the city , she was also it ##ching to put on the outfit and get back in bed with pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then let ' s go , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh certainly did n ' t need any more convincing . [SEP]
[CLS] digging in his pocket , he took out his wallet and threw a wa ##d of euros on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] then he popped out of seat like a jack - in - the - box . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to snatch up her purse and bag to keep up with him before he sprinted out the door and into the sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] as she passed the colorful flowers in bloom outside the cafe , they transported her back to her wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a perfect , cloud ##less day when she stood with pe ##sh in the rose garden at her papa ' s house . [SEP]
[CLS] to her , he had never looked more handsome than in his black tu ##x that fit his built frame like a second skin . [SEP]
[CLS] since she was the master of party planning , megan had enlisted emma ' s help in getting the quick ##ie wedding done . [SEP]
[CLS] even with newborn caroline to tend to , emma had gone above and beyond any expectations megan had . [SEP]
[CLS] tears had stung her eyes when she first caught sight of the garden as she , on her father ' s arm , made her way from the house to the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] white chairs draped with blue silk bun ##ting lined the garden in rows while a tent had been erected to the side of the makeshift altar . [SEP]
[CLS] next to the chairs , vo ##tive candles lit the way up the aisle that was adorned in multi ##color ##ed rose petals . [SEP]
[CLS] emma , casey , and two of her best friends from childhood stood at the altar in their corn ##flower blue bride ##sma ##id dresses . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh , along with his brothers and aidan , wore blue vest ##s with their tu ##xes . [SEP]
[CLS] a string quartet struck up the br ##idal march to herald her arrival . [SEP]
[CLS] she would never , ever forget the feeling of walking up the aisle to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] his loving gaze took her in , and she felt like the princess she had always wanted to be on her wedding day . [SEP]
[CLS] her dress was almost like what a disney princess might wear - a long train , a full ball gown , a bo ##dice en ##cr ##ust ##ed with pearls and se ##quin ##s , and then a glittering tia ##ra holding her veil in place . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire world seemed to eva ##por ##ate when pe ##sh took her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] he was her only focus . [SEP]
[CLS] she barely heard the words the priest spoke or the lyrics of the song that emma sang . [SEP]
[CLS] she just stared at her soon - to - be husband - the man who made her believe in romance and true love . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so lost in thoughts of her wedding day that she accidentally mo ##wed into a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , ' ' she apologized . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman scowled at her while cursing at megan in french . [SEP]
[CLS] well , megan imagined it was cursing since she did n ' t speak french . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where is that head of yours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thinking of our wedding day , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] his smile grew broader at her response , and in the middle of a crowded street , he stopped to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] while it was somewhat cha ##ste and full of more love than lust , it did hold a promise of what was to come later on . [SEP]
[CLS] he ended it far sooner than she would like . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s hurry , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled before breaking into a slight run towards the hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] he followed her example . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time they pushed through the revolving doors into the lobby , they were both breathless . [SEP]
[CLS] like two mischievous kids , they raced to the elevators . [SEP]
[CLS] once inside , they wrapped their arms around each other and kissed passionate ##ly until the door ding ##ed open . [SEP]
[CLS] they pulled apart long enough to get down the hall and into their suite . [SEP]
[CLS] when the door closed behind them , pe ##sh pulled her to him , best ##owing a lingering kiss on her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] as he ravaged her mouth , his tongue darted inside to tease along hers . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt his evident desire poking into her stomach , she broke the kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] at his groan , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to get dressed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` next time , ' ' he muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] pushing out of his arms , she grinned up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be back in just a second . [SEP]
[CLS] you get ready . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' ll be ready . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s a promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and then practically skipped into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] once she closed and locked the door , she sat the bag down and dug inside . [SEP]
[CLS] after she decided what to wear , she laid them out on the counter , and then started taking off her clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was naked , she reached for the linger ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] the tight bo ##dice was solid black with pink ribbons that wo ##ve through making intricate designs . [SEP]
[CLS] it pushed her br * * sts up and over the cups , making her appear to have far more cl ##e * * age than she was blessed with . [SEP]
[CLS] the black and pink panties were lace and practically see through . [SEP]
[CLS] on her legs , she slid black silk stockings that had pink bows at the tops of her thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] as she flu ##ffed out her hair , she could n ' t help gazing in the mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked quite the sex ##pot , which she hoped pleased pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] well , she knew it would please pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was raven ##ous for her , something for which she was very thankful . [SEP]
[CLS] not quite the polite gentleman she had expected when she first met him , that was for sure . [SEP]
[CLS] megan opened the bathroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] across the room , pe ##sh stood gazing out the window , stripped down to his boxer shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] when she cleared her throat , he jerked his head to stare at her . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , she walked out of the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes stayed on him . [SEP]
[CLS] a shiver rippled through her as he tracked her every move . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally stood before him , it took less than a second for him to po ##unce on her . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands grabbed her by the waist , jerking her flush against him . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth bore down on hers in a frantic kiss as he ground his c * * k between her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] breathless , she pulled away to gaze up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does this mean you like the linger ##ie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh hell yes , i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i think we ' re going to have to go back and get you some more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more shopping ? [SEP]
[CLS] you wo n ' t hear me say no to that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] bending over , pe ##sh brought his arm under her knees and then lifted her up . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt so light in his arms as he walked her over to the bed and gently deposited her on the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] as he loomed over her , her heartbeat sped up in anticipation the sensual del ##ica ##cies she was about to experience . [SEP]
[CLS] tugging on the straps of the bo ##dice , he bared her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth hovered over her nipple , breathing warm air onto the cool tip . [SEP]
[CLS] it puck ##ered under his attention before his tongue darted out and flicked it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' she murmured , her fingers tightening in his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] making slow circles around her nipple , pe ##sh continued his teasing assault . [SEP]
[CLS] arching her back , she gripped the strands of his hair tighter , willing him to take her nipple in his whole mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he obliged her , sucking the hardened peak into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] while he gave oral attention to one breast , his hand palm ##ed and stroked the other . [SEP]
[CLS] as the heat and moisture built in her core , megan began saw ##ing her legs back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] the friction eased her a little , but she wanted pe ##sh ' s fingers , tongue , and dick there more than anything . [SEP]
[CLS] over the fabric of her bo ##dice , he kissed down her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] just as he reached the jun ##cture between her legs , he bypassed it and began kissing and licking the exposed skin on her upper thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] she groaned in protest . [SEP]
[CLS] he gazed up at her with a teasing smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you want me to kiss you somewhere else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] raising her hips , she replied , ` ` you know where i want you - where i want all of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` patience , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she muttered . [SEP]
[CLS] with one quick movement , she was out from underneath him in a flash . [SEP]
[CLS] surprise filled his face as she flipped him over onto his back and st ##rad ##dled him once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ra ##king her fingernails down his chest , she stopped just at the waistband of his boxers . [SEP]
[CLS] as his breath hitch ##ed , her hands went to his thighs , scraping a trail up the exposed skin to his dick . [SEP]
[CLS] his h * ps buck ##ed up , causing her to smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , did you want me to touch you somewhere else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a growl , he gripped her by the ass and forced her onto her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid down the mattress to where her core was right at his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue flicked out , sliding along the thin scrap of her panties . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped as he flattened his tongue and rubbed it over her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] even through the fabric , it lit her on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] as he added more pressure , she began to rock her h * ps against his face . [SEP]
[CLS] closing her eyes , she concentrated on the feel of tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled away , she whimpered . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips came to kiss along her thighs again . [SEP]
[CLS] just as pe ##sh ' s teeth dug into one of the bows on her stockings , megan ' s ring ##tone for mason b ##lar ##ed out over her frustrated breaths . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh protested the interruption with a grunt , but immediately let the stock ##ing fall from his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s his bed ##time call . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to take it , ' ' megan said , as she sat up in the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s all right , my love . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m the one with patience , not you , ' ' he replied , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes at him as she grabbed the phone off the nightstand and answered it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey baby , ' ' she said , trying to catch her breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi mommy . [SEP]
[CLS] miss you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her heart warmed hearing his tiny voice while an ache filled her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i miss you too , sweet boy . [SEP]
[CLS] are you being good for grammy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##way with noah today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you ? [SEP]
[CLS] did you have fun ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh . [SEP]
[CLS] but cao ##wine cw ##ies . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed at his sum ##mation of the latest fitzgerald family member . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bet she does . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a little baby , and they do like to cry . [SEP]
[CLS] you cried a lot when you were that age . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where daddy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at pe ##sh , megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s right here . [SEP]
[CLS] you want to talk to him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan handed the phone to pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] his face lit up as he said , ` ` hey buddy , how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as mason rattled along to pe ##sh , megan could n ' t help thinking of how happy mason had been on her wedding day . [SEP]
[CLS] he had played his part as ring bearer wonderful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone commented on how handsome he was in small tu ##x and how much he looked like her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so excited to have a daddy and to be part of a real family . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even seem to mind that they were moving away from his grandparents into pe ##sh ' s house . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , pe ##sh had sweet ##ened the moving ang ##st by having a black lab puppy , just like beau , waiting for mason in his new room . [SEP]
[CLS] he had squealed so loud that megan thought her ear drums were going to burst . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , so beau two pee - pee ##d on grammy ' s rug , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , throwing megan an ` ` oh shit ' ' look . [SEP]
[CLS] while they were away , angie was in charge of both mason and the puppy , who mason had apt ##ly named beau two after his first love , beau . [SEP]
[CLS] megan could imagine her mother was fit to be tied with her rug ##s being christ ##ened by puppy piss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , you better go to bed now . [SEP]
[CLS] mommy and i miss you very , very much . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re bringing you lots of presents home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at mason ' s reply , tears shi ##mmer ##ed in pe ##sh ' s eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too , buddy , ' ' he replied , in a choked voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` say goodnight to mommy , ' ' he replied , thrusting the phone at megan . [SEP]
[CLS] a sheep ##ish expression came over pe ##sh ' s face as he ground the moisture from his eyes with his fists . [SEP]
[CLS] megan took the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` night , night , mommy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason called . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` night , night , baby . [SEP]
[CLS] you have sweet dreams , and i ' ll talk to you tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] wu ##v you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after megan hung up , she still cradled the phone to her ear as if by doing that , she was able to have mason a little closer . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s hand came to rest on hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s something , is n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , he is , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know it makes me a complete pan ##sy , but every time he tells me he loves , i ca n ' t help but cry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] putting her phone back on the nightstand , megan eased herself over onto pe ##sh ' s lap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you ever worry that i think you ' re a pan ##sy because of what you feel for mason . [SEP]
[CLS] it makes me love you even more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] brushing her hand across his cheek , she added , ` ` a man who is n ' t afraid of showing his emotions or his vulnerability is very sexy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear you say that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where were we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing down at his crotch , pe ##sh said , ` ` i think we ' re starting over from my perspective . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan ' s hand went to cup his now def ##lated erection . [SEP]
[CLS] she rubbed him over the boxers before dipping her hand inside to grip him . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh hissed in a breath . [SEP]
[CLS] his head fell back against the head ##board as she started stroking his growing length . [SEP]
[CLS] sliding down his body , she brought her hand to his lap and took him into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] her tongue teasing ##ly flicked across the tip . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh ' s hand came to tangle in her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] she did leisure ##ly strokes up and down his length before bringing him into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] as she began bob ##bing up and down , pe ##sh ' s groans echoed through the room . [SEP]
[CLS] as she cut her gaze up to him , he glanced down at her with hooded eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so good , baby . [SEP]
[CLS] so , so good , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] when he started tens ##ing up , she let him fall free of her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to come inside me , ' ' she said , as she climbed up his body . [SEP]
[CLS] rising up on her knees , she brought pe ##sh ' s hands to the elastic band of her underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] he tore them off her h * ps and down her thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow she managed to get them off and toss them to the floor beside the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] leaving on the bust ##ier , she guided his erection to her core . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , she eased down on him , inch by inch . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was balls deep inside her , she sat back on his thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] raising her knees , she placed both her feet flat on the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] from this position , she was giving pe ##sh quite the view as she rose on and off of him . [SEP]
[CLS] as the pressure began building inside her , the more frantic her movements became . [SEP]
[CLS] harder and harder she bounced , the sound of skin slapping along with grunt ##s and panting echoing through the room . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh ' s fingers came to tease her clit , she came undone , crying out and collapsing onto his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued raising his h * ps to pump into her until he came a few moments later . [SEP]
[CLS] brushing the hair out of her face , pe ##sh stared up at megan with a satisfied expression . [SEP]
[CLS] she brought her lips to his for a gentle kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , mr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bobbed her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you and your talented fingers and dick , all of who give me wonderful orgasm ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he barked out a laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve married such a naughty girl , have n ' t i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you have . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would n ' t have you any other way , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled as he slid free of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] easing her onto her side , pe ##sh spoon ##ed up behind her , nu ##zzling his face in her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rest now , ' ' he said , dr ##ows ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you need your rest . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to want more of you in a little while . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his chuckle made her tingle with love and lust . [SEP]
[CLS] with the feel of his arm wrapped around her , megan let her dr ##ooping eyes close and drifted off to a content ##ed sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - three as they sat outside the courtroom waiting to be called in , megan adjusted mason ' s blue and white striped tie for the hundred ##th time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mommy , no , ' ' he pleaded . [SEP]
[CLS] she snatched her hands away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , sweetheart . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll leave you alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tank you , ' ' he replied , going back to his game on his tablet . [SEP]
[CLS] the truth was her nervous hands needed to be doing something . [SEP]
[CLS] sensing her need , pe ##sh reached over and took her hands in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax . [SEP]
[CLS] everything is going to be fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan wanted to believe him , but she could n ' t help feeling anxious . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t be able to calm down until the ink had dried on the paperwork . [SEP]
[CLS] her feet , en ##cased in black heels , tapped anxiously on the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] the cl ##atter ##ing noise echoed around the atrium . [SEP]
[CLS] as she glanced between pe ##sh and mason , megan had to smile . [SEP]
[CLS] the two men in her life looked almost identical today in their navy suits and ties . [SEP]
[CLS] of course mason ' s was considerably smaller than pe ##sh ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] when the door opened and a clerk poked her head out the door , megan ' s heartbeat started thru ##mming faster and faster . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` megan nad ##een ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shot off the bench . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s us . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i ' m megan nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the clerk smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you guys can come in now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] taking a deep breath , megan reached for mason ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is it , baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned and then glanced up at pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you be my daddy now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' m going to be your daddy for real now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they walked through the massive doors of the courtroom . [SEP]
[CLS] the judge , in his ominous black robe , gazed down at them from his bench . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , ' ' he said , politely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` g - good morning , ' ' megan stammered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand that we ' re here today to petition for the adoption of the minor child , mason patrick mckenzie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' megan and pe ##sh replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first , we need to swear you all in , ' ' the judge said . [SEP]
[CLS] megan went through the motions of the procedure , trying desperately to calm her nerves . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh had first bro ##ache ##d the subject of formally adopting mason , she initially had been thrilled and honored . [SEP]
[CLS] but then she had to worry about whether davis would allow pe ##sh to adopt mason or not . [SEP]
[CLS] although he still had nothing to do with his son , davis had n ' t shown a lot of enthusiasm about the prospect . [SEP]
[CLS] the closer they got to the adoption hearing , the more megan worried that he would refuse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dr . nad ##een , i understand that you wish to adopt the minor child of your wife ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded enthusiastically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , your honor , i would . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see that you and your wife have been married less than two months , and that you ' ve only known her a year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his point ##y nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think it wise to legally bind yourself to this child after such a short time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan fought the urge to stalk up to the bench and smack the judge . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she took deep breaths and tried to reign in her temper . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced over at pe ##sh who merely smiled pleasantly at the judge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your honor , i realize that on paper it might seem as though i am rushing into things . [SEP]
[CLS] however , i ' ve never been more certain of anything in my life as i am about my love for megan and in turn , my love for mason . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve waited a long time to be a father , and i do n ' t want to have to waste another second . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the judge eyed the folder open before him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand the biological father has had no contact with the child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s correct , ' ' megan replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he has also waved his parental rights so that dr . nad ##een can adopt his son . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan exhaled a relieved breath that davis had signed the paperwork . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear that , your honor , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you feel that your husband will make a good father for your son ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never would have dated , least of all married him , if i did n ' t believe that pe ##sh would be a good and loving father to mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so the fact that he is a wealthy doctor had nothing to do with it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how dare you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cried . [SEP]
[CLS] when pe ##sh grabbed her arm to silence her , she slung him away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve known us for two minutes and you ' re making assumptions about me , my husband , and my marriage ? [SEP]
[CLS] if this were about money , i could have used his father for child support considering he is a wealthy nfl player . [SEP]
[CLS] but i would have sacrificed everything to ensure that my son had a good father ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mrs . nad ##een , i will ask that you control yourself , or i will have to hold you in contempt , ' ' the judge said stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh wrapped his arm around her waist , drawing her against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` easy , ' ' he murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] although she hated to do it , she said , ` ` i ' m sorry , your honor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when he smiled at her , she gasped in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i am sorry for rattling you , mrs . nad ##een . [SEP]
[CLS] i often say or do uno ##rth ##od ##ox things to see the true nature of the people who come before me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , you said that to get a reaction from me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i did . [SEP]
[CLS] and you un ##wave ##ring ##ly rose to my challenge . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see that you are truly concerned with the well ##bei ##ng of your son . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] still reeling from the judge ' s behavior , megan mumbled , ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] peering down over the bench , the judge sur ##mise ##d mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` son , do you know why you ' re here today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i get ##tin ' ' do ##pt ##ed , ' ' mason replied . [SEP]
[CLS] the judge smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you are . [SEP]
[CLS] do you want pe ##sh to be your daddy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , huh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want anyone else to be your daddy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' mason replied quickly , shaking his head back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then come up here while i sign the paperwork . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason happily ran around the side of the bench to the judge . [SEP]
[CLS] he climbed up onto the judge ' s lap . [SEP]
[CLS] after signing several sets of papers , the judge handed mason his gave ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` once you bang that gave ##l , pe ##sh is officially your daddy , and you are mason nad ##een . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a broad grin , mason brought the gave ##l down . [SEP]
[CLS] tears stung megan ' s eyes , and she gladly let pe ##sh pull her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , thank you , thank you , ' ' she murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , ' ' he replied , squeezing her tight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] their attention was drawn to where mason kept banging the gave ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the judge chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i think that is enough . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t you go to your mommy and daddy now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell the judge thank you , ' ' megan instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tank you , ' ' mason replied , before he hopped off the judge ' s lap and came running to them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' do ##pt ##ed ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' do ##pt ##ed ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh bent down to pick him up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right , buddy . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re my son for now and always . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled and patted mason ' s back as they started out of the courtroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s go to papa ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve got a big party for you there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason ' s face lit up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ice cw ##ea ##m ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes , there ' s lots of ice cream just for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ya ##y ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cried . [SEP]
[CLS] when they drove up at patrick ' s , megan did a double take at the sight of an in ##fl ##atable bo ##un ##cy castle out on the lawn . [SEP]
[CLS] john , percy , and georgie were already making good use of it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma , the party planning monster has struck again , ' ' she mused . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh chuckled as he got out of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] he went to get mason while she started into the house . [SEP]
[CLS] balloons and flowers filled the foyer and living room . [SEP]
[CLS] over the dining room archway , there was a giant congratulations mason sign . [SEP]
[CLS] when she got to the kitchen , she sucked in a breath at the sight of all the catering pan ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma fitzgerald , what have you done ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of megan ' s voice , emma jumped . [SEP]
[CLS] clutching her chest , she whirled around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , so maybe i found a really excellent deal on the bo ##un ##cy castle . [SEP]
[CLS] like ridiculous ##ly cheap . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan crossed her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the food ? [SEP]
[CLS] i thought mom and my aunt ##s were cooking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] holding up one hand , emma replied , ` ` just williamson brothers bb ##q . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing fancy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything else i need to know about ? [SEP]
[CLS] live band or celebrity bursting out of a cake ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan watched emma bust ##le around the kitchen , setting up the plates and cutler ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , is there anything i can do ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i feel pretty shitty considering this is my son ' s adoption party , ' ' megan said , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] pink tinged emma ' s cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan threw her arms around emma and squeezed her tight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re amazing to do all of this for us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re more than welcome . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so happy for you and pe ##sh and for mason . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when megan pulled away , emma said , ` ` oh , there is something you can do . [SEP]
[CLS] go tell aidan we ' re about to start . [SEP]
[CLS] he went to get caroline up from her nap . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be happy to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as megan started down the familiar hallway , she stopped outside of aidan ' s boy ##hood bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] through the crack in the door , she could see him walking around the room , bouncing caroline in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of his singing , she had to st ##if ##le a laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ankle was many things , but a singer was n ' t one of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sweet caroline , du ##m , du ##m , du ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] good times never seemed so good , ' ' he cr ##oon ##ed off - key . [SEP]
[CLS] when megan pushed open the door , aidan jumped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , hey , ' ' he said , a flush entering his cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never really pictured you as a neil diamond fan , ' ' she said , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , sweet caroline seems like the right thing to sing to her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cleared his throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing in here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emma wanted me to come get you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] in his arms , caroline began to whimper , her little fists fl ##ailed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sh ##h , it ' s okay , sweet pea . [SEP]
[CLS] where was i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been inclined , ' ' megan answered him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' he said , over caroline ' s cries . [SEP]
[CLS] when he picked back up with the song , megan said , ` ` that ' s really unfair to torture her like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as aidan scowled at megan , caroline began to quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s expression then turned triumphant . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? [SEP]
[CLS] she likes it when i sing to her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ca n ' t sing , ' ' megan protested . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it does n ' t matter to her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she has a mother with a killer voice , yet she likes to listen to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] flashing his signature cocky grin , aidan replied , ` ` what can i say ? [SEP]
[CLS] all women love me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a roll of her eyes , megan said , ` ` give me a break . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing down at caroline , aidan said in a sing - song voice , ` ` do n ' t you have the sweet ##est , handsome ##st , and most wonderful daddy in the whole wide world ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] caroline co ##oed at his question and kicked her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s a smart girl because she knows how lucky she is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re terrible , ' ' megan said , with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan looked from his daughter over to megan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want to hold my most perfect little princess ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would love to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she held out her arms as aidan passed caroline to her . [SEP]
[CLS] outfit ##ted in a fr ##illy purple dress and purple bow , caroline looked like she could be modeling baby wear . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike noah ' s strawberry blond hair , hers was a deep auburn . [SEP]
[CLS] she had also inherited her mother ' s green eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to agree that you ' re a lucky girl because you look just like your mother , ' ' megan said . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , she is a little mini - emma , is n ' t she ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she is . [SEP]
[CLS] boy , she ' s going to give you hell when she ' s a teenager , ' ' megan teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] trust me , i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as caroline smiled up at her , megan could n ' t help sighing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a bad influence , missy . [SEP]
[CLS] you make me want to have another baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that a bad thing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s just . . . ' ' ` ` just what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i asked pe ##sh to give me a year of marriage before we start trying . [SEP]
[CLS] i know he ' s ready right now , but i just want this time with him . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , just the two of us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s understand ##able . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but holding her . . . ' ' megan shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re just bad for business , miss caroline . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about it . [SEP]
[CLS] whenever i hold her or noah , i think how much i ' m going to miss it when they ' re not babies anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] it na ##gs at me enough that i think i ' ll be okay if we have more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no vase ##ct ##omy on the horizon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no yet . [SEP]
[CLS] still not ruling it out though . [SEP]
[CLS] and as far as you and more babies , you ' ll know when the time is right . [SEP]
[CLS] and if anyone is patient and understanding , it ' s pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s true , ' ' megan murmured . [SEP]
[CLS] mason appeared in the doorway then . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ' mon , mommy . [SEP]
[CLS] want ice cw ##ea ##m ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , let me give your little bad influence back to you , ' ' she said , handing caroline to aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] she then took mason ' s hand and started out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` daddy says i have ice cw ##ea ##m first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan said , as she planned to st ##rangle pe ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh huh . [SEP]
[CLS] ' cause it ' s my ' do ##ption day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she met pe ##sh ' s eye , she raised her brows . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately , his face flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` spoil ##ing him rotten already , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned in a low voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a special day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm , and when this special day turns into an all night ##er because he ' s h ##ype ##d on sugar , you ' re going to deal with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan leaned up to kiss him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re too sweet for your own good . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re always going to have me playing bad cop when it comes to discipline . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you love me anyway , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he murmured against her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so much i was almost ready to rec ##ons ##ider our plan about when we ' re starting a family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes bulge ##d at her response . [SEP]
[CLS] it took him a few moments to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that means a lot that you would do that , but deep down i know how you really feel . [SEP]
[CLS] so , i ' m going to be good and patiently wait ten more months before con ##fi ##sca ##ting your birth control . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a deal , ' ' she replied , before kissing him again . [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue as soon as he finished with his last patient , pe ##sh practically sprinted from the exam room . [SEP]
[CLS] he hu ##stle ##d into the doctors ' lounge , trying hard to keep his head down and not call any attention to himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him back for a consult or to pull a longer shift . [SEP]
[CLS] once he had retrieved his things , he started for the parking lot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dr . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##een ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti called . [SEP]
[CLS] inwardly , he groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned , as he turned around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were n ' t leaving , were you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he exhaled a defeated breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was planning on it . [SEP]
[CLS] does someone need me to cover for them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##ti winked at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thought you were screwed there for a minute , did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a relieved laugh escaped his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have something for megan . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly kris ##ti , you did n ' t need to do anything else for us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] waving her hand dismiss ##ively , she handed a pink gift bag to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wanted to do this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after peeking inside , pe ##sh smiled before he leaned down to hug kris ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure she ' ll love it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you tell her we miss her around here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she patted his back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now go on home to your girls . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded and then hurried out the door . [SEP]
[CLS] today had been his first day back after taking both pat ##ern ##ity leave and some of his many amassed sick days . [SEP]
[CLS] as he slid into the seat of his jaguar , he felt a rush of embarrassment at how he had actually gotten tear ##y on the way to work that morning after leaving megan . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been the longest shift of his entire life . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought he would never be through so he could get home to her . [SEP]
[CLS] even now , the usual ten - minute drive home seemed to take an eternity . [SEP]
[CLS] he anxiously drum ##med his fingers on the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d tried not to pest ##er megan with too many calls and texts , but after the tenth , ` ` how are you guys ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] text , she ' d told him to light ##en up and get his head in the game at work . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s why he did n ' t even bother telling her he was on his way home . [SEP]
[CLS] as he pulled into the driveway , he noticed emma ' s suv . [SEP]
[CLS] he was glad to know that megan had n ' t been alone without him . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pushed through the garage door into the kitchen , emma was at the stove . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , ' ' he called pleasantly . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##hir ##ling around , she gave him a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello to you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are my girls ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve slept most of the day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] noticing how quiet the house was , he asked , ` ` where ' s mason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` patrick came by and got him , along with noah and caroline , a little while ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cocked her head at pe ##sh and grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` although he swore to me that he would n ' t ruin their dinner , i have a feeling they ' re having ice cream right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh smiled at the mention of his son . [SEP]
[CLS] although he was n ' t mason ' s biological father , the love he felt for him was just as strong as if he had been a part of his conception . [SEP]
[CLS] from the moment he ' d been able to adopt him , he had felt an even stronger bond than before , especially whenever he saw ` ` mason nad ##een ' ' written on his pre - school paperwork . [SEP]
[CLS] more than anything , he re ##lish ##ed being a father . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been forced to wait so long , while des ##iring it so hard , that it made it all the more sweet ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] because mason adored baseball , pe ##sh had bought season tickets to the braves , rather than the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] even though pe ##sh had never been athletic ##ally inclined , he signed up to help coach mason ' s little league team as well . [SEP]
[CLS] every time he heard mason say ` ` daddy , ' ' it warmed his heart the same as it did to hear megan say ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh eyed the dishes on the stove . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s awful ##ly kind of you to come stay with megan on my first day back . [SEP]
[CLS] but we certainly did n ' t expect for you to cook . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s my pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , it kills two birds with one stone - i can feed my family and yours . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s coming by after work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be glad to see him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as his gaze swept toward the living room , emma laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to stay here with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i know you want to see your girls . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i have missed them terribly today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after giving emma a quick kiss on the cheek , he made his way into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sight of megan sleeping on the couch next to a fr ##illy pink pack n play , his chest swelled with so much love and pride he felt like it might explode . [SEP]
[CLS] peeking over the side of the pack n play , he eyed his dark - haired daughters . [SEP]
[CLS] after waiting so long to become a father , he had been do ##ub ##ly blessed when they found out they were having twins . [SEP]
[CLS] while aidan liked to claim that his fear of the twin gene in his family had bypassed him , and instead , it had found its way to megan , that was n ' t entirely true . [SEP]
[CLS] his girls were identical twins , which had nothing to do with old wives ' tales . [SEP]
[CLS] the two of them looked so much alike that megan put different colored socks on them to tell them apart . [SEP]
[CLS] although it had freaked megan out a little at the prospect of two babies to care for along with mason , pe ##sh was thrilled . [SEP]
[CLS] every aspect of the pregnancy and birth had been special to him . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , megan had been blessed with great health , although she had been advised to take early maternity leave to stay off her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] after her clinical ##s , she had accepted a job in the er at wells ##tar , where they sometimes were on similar shifts . [SEP]
[CLS] the girls arrived only a few weeks short of their due date and were both healthy five pounder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] six weeks later , they were thriving and were the greatest joy in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] sucking relentless ##ly on her pac ##ifier , maya ' s wide eyes took in her surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] she stretched and fl ##ailed her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] if she was n ' t careful , she was going to hit her sister . [SEP]
[CLS] since sara remained sleeping sound ##ly , pe ##sh bent over and picked maya up . [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her cheek before drawing her close to his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] as he stared into her tiny face , he could n ' t help the surge of love that overtook him . [SEP]
[CLS] for all the years of struggle and heart ##ache he had endured , it was moments like these that made him feel as though he was finally complete . [SEP]
[CLS] his heart was full , and he was so thankful . [SEP]
[CLS] once they learned they were having girls , he and megan had decided to give them both indian and irish names to represent their combined heritage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] maya , which meant princess and honorable in indian , was coupled with katherine , to honor emma , whose middle name was katherine . [SEP]
[CLS] without emma , he and megan never would have met . [SEP]
[CLS] sara , which meant ' soul ' , was given her mother ' s real name , margaret , as her middle name . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sound of megan ' s gentle s ##nor ##es , he smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you wear your mommy out today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked maya . [SEP]
[CLS] she opened her tiny mouth like she wished she could respond to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s wake her up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after he swept a strand of megan ' s long blonde hair out of her face , pe ##sh leaned down to kiss her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] she stirred as her eyes fluttered opened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' she said with a lazy smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , my love , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how was your first day back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , as she stretched her arms over her head . [SEP]
[CLS] he grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely miserable without you and the girls . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we missed you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jerked her chin up at maya . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she cried for thirty minutes straight after you left . [SEP]
[CLS] i think we have a serious daddy ' s girl on our hands . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , gazing down at maya . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help the warm glow that spread through his chest at megan ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] at just six weeks old , his girls were already showing distinct and different personalities . [SEP]
[CLS] maya was in ##qui ##sit ##ive and fought sleep to be awake to see what all was going on . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d ended up holding her more than sara simply because maya often exhausted megan by not going to sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] sara , on the other hand , was already very sweet tempered and a natural s ##nu ##ggle ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] she probably represented his more laid - back , quiet personality where maya was likely to be a little fire ##cr ##acker , just like her mom . [SEP]
[CLS] maya stared up at him , her dark eyes peering intently at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you miss me , my little princess ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a fleeting smile appeared on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , she smiled at you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] megan cried . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but babies do n ' t respond with smiling until later . [SEP]
[CLS] it must be gas or something , ' ' he argued . [SEP]
[CLS] megan nudged his leg with her knee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she most definitely smiled at you , pe ##sh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rose off the couch to rub maya ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you smiled at your daddy , did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without taking her eyes off of pe ##sh , maya flashed another smile and waved her fist . [SEP]
[CLS] the sight caused tears to sting his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he blinked fast , trying to clear them . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t like feeling emotionally weak in front of megan . [SEP]
[CLS] but he knew he was busted the moment megan murmured , ` ` oh baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she slid her arm around his waist , leaning up on her tip ##to ##es to burr ##ow her face in his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know how much my love for you grows because you just got tear ##y over your daughter ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced down at her in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him a brief kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after davis , all i ever wanted was for my children to have a father who loved and adored them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you make that dream come true every day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his lips to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth worked frantically to illustrate all that he was feeling inside - the intense love that he felt would burst from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , ' ' he murmured against her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] just as he started to kiss her again , a loud commotion in the kitchen drew them apart . [SEP]
[CLS] megan rubbed his cheek tenderly before best ##owing a kiss on maya ' s head . [SEP]
[CLS] she then jerked her chin towards the kitchen , and he followed her . [SEP]
[CLS] patrick had just burst through the back ##door with all the kids in tow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re back ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mason called , as he bobbed around the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] three - year - old noah and his two - year - old sister , caroline , made a bee ##line for their mother . [SEP]
[CLS] they began chatter ##ing non - stop to emma while their bodies shook with un ##sp ##ent energy . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh watched with amusement as emma ' s hand came to her hip and she pointed her stirring spoon at patrick . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you gave them ice cream , did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] patrick shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m a grandfather . [SEP]
[CLS] spoil ##ing them is what i ' m supposed to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , and then you bring them home to det ##ox on my watch . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mommy , i hung ##wy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] caroline protested , st ##omp ##ing her foot . [SEP]
[CLS] with her auburn hair swept back in pig ##tails and her emerald eyes narrowing in determination , she looked just like her mother . [SEP]
[CLS] well , her expression was pure aidan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` caroline fitzgerald , you get one ice cream cone in you , and you start acting like you have no manners . [SEP]
[CLS] we do not st ##omp our feet to get what we want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she appeared thoughtful for a moment before saying , ` ` p ##we ##ase mommy , i ve ##wy hung ##wy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the dining room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on guys , ' ' mason said . [SEP]
[CLS] at almost four - and - a - half , he was always the caretaker of his younger cousins . [SEP]
[CLS] noah and caroline followed him into the half bathroom off the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] cr ##ad ##ling maya in his arms , pe ##sh joined emma at the stove . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something sure smells good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s megan ' s favorite chicken cass ##ero ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] then there ' s bro ##cco ##li and cheese cass ##ero ##le , green beans , and some corn ##bread , extra crisp ##y on the edges just like megan loves it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her mouth turned down in a frown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry it ' s not indian food . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would have been very surprised if it had been considering how much you did n ' t appreciate it many years ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] patrick nodded in agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s quite a spread you ' ve fixed for us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emma smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was happy to do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you feeling all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked , motion ##ing to her expanding belly . [SEP]
[CLS] emma patted her bump loving ##ly before responding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' ve felt the best this pregnancy out of all the others . [SEP]
[CLS] you would think with a three and two - year - old , i would be exhausted all the time , but it ' s amazing how good i ' ve felt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] patrick gave a beaming smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t tell you how thrilled i am to be having yet another grandson to carry on the family name . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a wink , he added , ` ` not to mention the fact he ' s been given fine irish names . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan and emma had found out the sex of their third , and final child , the week before . [SEP]
[CLS] they had decided on the name connor liam , which was a double representation of irish names . [SEP]
[CLS] while emma ' s best friend , connor , was thrilled at the namesake , he also wanted them to call the baby connor as well . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , it would be liam fitzgerald joining the rest of the crew in four and a half months . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and is aidan still feeling okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh asked . [SEP]
[CLS] emma opened her mouth to answer him , but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me and my soon to be non - swimmers are just fine , ' ' he replied , with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] a week before he had gone under the laser for a vase ##ct ##omy . [SEP]
[CLS] while caroline had been a surprise , liam had not . [SEP]
[CLS] with emma nearing thirty - four , they thought it best to finish out their family while they were still young . [SEP]
[CLS] and while emma was pregnant and there were no worries about conception , aidan thought it was the best time to get his vase ##ct ##omy and let it take effect . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` daddy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] caroline squealed , as she came bound ##ing around the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] aidan ' s grin grew wider as he took his daughter in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi sweet pea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she kissed both of his cheeks before she started wig ##gling , wanting down . [SEP]
[CLS] noah ran to him next , and he got to hold his son a little longer as noah told him all about his day helping out with the babies . [SEP]
[CLS] a cry from the living room snapped pe ##sh ' s attention away from aidan and emma . [SEP]
[CLS] megan was bending over the pack n play , picking up sara . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aw , what ' s wrong , sweetheart ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she co ##oed , as she took sara into her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] as megan rocked her back and forth , sara continued wai ##ling , which caused maya ' s face to cr ##ump ##le up as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must be hungry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll get their bottles , ' ' pe ##sh called , over the twin ' s loud cries . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as emma worked to gather the kids , along with patrick and aidan , around the dining room table , pe ##sh got busy heating up the formula . [SEP]
[CLS] once he had the two bottles fixed , he grabbed them and then went to the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] megan was already seated with mason trying to entertain sara to stop crying her crying . [SEP]
[CLS] he passed a bottle to megan before sitting down himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d barely gotten the bottle in her mouth before maya started sucking greed ##ily at the formula . [SEP]
[CLS] as aidan reached to start spoon ##ing some chicken cass ##ero ##le onto his plate , patrick shot him a di ##sa ##pp ##roving look . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , aidan dropped the serving spoon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you go ##n na say grace even though it ' s not your house , pop ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why yes , i am . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s good for all these children to learn , ' ' he replied , motion ##ing to noah and caroline who sat between their parents , and then over to mason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it should be up to pe ##sh and megan whether it ' s said or not , ' ' aidan grumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh held up his free hand that was n ' t holding maya . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] truly , i do n ' t mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] aidan mouthed ` ` suck up ' ' at him before grinning . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##sh merely shook his head at aidan ' s antics . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then let ' s return thanks , ' ' patrick said . [SEP]
[CLS] with maya still taking long pulls at her bottle , pe ##sh bowed his head . [SEP]
[CLS] as patrick recited the blessing , pe ##sh could n ' t help feeling so very blessed himself . [SEP]
[CLS] three years ago , the dining room would have been empty . [SEP]
[CLS] most likely , he would have been grabbing something on the way home or finishing some left ##over take ##out . [SEP]
[CLS] but now , he had a beautiful , loving wife by his side - one he fell a little more in love with each and every day . [SEP]
[CLS] across from him , he had a son who was strong and healthy . [SEP]
[CLS] in his arms and his wife ' s , he had two daughters who he could n ' t wait to see what the future held for them . [SEP]
[CLS] he also had the love and support of good friends and family . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the day , true love in its many forms was all you could really hope for and cl ##ing to . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 1 that ' s it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m span ##king her ass as soon as we get back to the house , right before i f * * k her little ass into submission . [SEP]
[CLS] i watched with the other couple hundred thousand spectators as she g ##yra ##ted her ass and fl ##au ##nted what belonged to me for all to see . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , i know it ' s her job as the newest and hottest pop sensation on the scene today , but we talked about this shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i have no problem with her performing , but there ' s such a thing as going too far . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d come out on the stage dressed conservative ##ly enough in the floor length dress with the split up the middle to her crotch . [SEP]
[CLS] even that was a bit ri ##sque for my taste , but i could n ' t expect her to change everything overnight . [SEP]
[CLS] what i did n ' t expect , and what was now driving me insane , is the two piece bikini number she was now wearing after dropping the dress , or more to the point , after one of the male dancers had und ##ressed her on stage . [SEP]
[CLS] no one sitting near me could tell that i was see ##thing with rage . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my face at ease and my sl ##ou ##ch in the chair in the front row of the awards show was that of a man with nothing on his mind but enjoying the show . [SEP]
[CLS] by now everyone knew we were an item , the thirty - five year old business mo ##gul , and the twenty - three year old pop sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d been able to keep our affair hidden for all of two months and that only because of my high security . [SEP]
[CLS] but now the cat was out of the bag and everyone was in our f * * king business . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t too worried about it , i just do n ' t like my personal life splashed across the headlines , but i guess it came with the territory . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d seen her for the first time three months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] it was at a linger ##ie show of all things . [SEP]
[CLS] not my usual mil ##ieu , but my sister had dragged me along since her husband was away on business , and she did n ' t want to go it alone . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d sat there prepared to be bored out of my mind for the next two hours or so . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve seen and had my fair share of models over the years , and they no longer appealed . [SEP]
[CLS] so imagine my surprise when she came on stage . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no idea who she was , but from the crowd ' s reaction she was someone of note ; before she even opened her mouth to sing the place had gone insane . [SEP]
[CLS] it was her voice that caught my attention first , sul ##try and hot , with an old world flavor to it . [SEP]
[CLS] when i finally looked up at the stage , my breath had got caught in my lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] she was f * * king magnificent . [SEP]
[CLS] i wondered how many of the men in the audience were focused on her instead of the scan ##ti ##ly clad models as they made their way down the runway . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i spent the next three minutes or however long the song was , totally capt ##ivated by her . [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled my phone and cancelled my dinner date and essentially ended the six - month relationship i ' d been barely having with another woman . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a man of action , i ' ve learned in the cut ##th ##ro ##at world of high finance that there ' s no other way to be . [SEP]
[CLS] when i see something that i want , i go after it . [SEP]
[CLS] consequences be damned . [SEP]
[CLS] they had her name highlighted behind her on the stage so i used my phone to google her . [SEP]
[CLS] i needed to find out what moves i had to make to acquire her . [SEP]
[CLS] if she were married , i ' d step back . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not my style . [SEP]
[CLS] anything else , she was fair game . [SEP]
[CLS] shia ##ne ; she was twenty - three years old and had been heating up the charts for the last two with hit after hit since her debut . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d only been linked with one guy in the past two years . [SEP]
[CLS] some on again , off again deal with a kid who was not much older than she . [SEP]
[CLS] they were having an off period ; perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] if i had anything to say about that , it would be a permanent thing , or until i ' d had my fill at least . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not one for long relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] i stay as long as they run their course and leave when they ' ve grown stale . [SEP]
[CLS] i have yet to find a woman who could hold my interest for more than a few months at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] and i always let them know up front what the deal is . [SEP]
[CLS] though it seemed women were always saying they were fine with it until the end came . [SEP]
[CLS] like cynthia , that night when i ' d called to tell her it was over . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t the most conventional way to do things . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , i sent over one of tiffany ' s little blue boxes to ease the blow , but there was no time , so i ' d have to do it the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] she started to get upset on the phone and i had to remind her of the words i ' d spoken on our first date . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t too happy , but it will have to su ##ffi ##ce . [SEP]
[CLS] as much of a bastard as i am , the thought of pursuing one woman while em ##bro ##iled with another , just did n ' t suit me . [SEP]
[CLS] after the phone call , i ' d sat there and watched the an ##ore ##xi ##c looking cloth ##e - horses as they pr ##ance ##d up and down the stage . [SEP]
[CLS] there was still a buzz about the hot little star ##let who ' d just left the stage , and i smiled quietly to myself when i heard some ass behind me tell his friends that he was going to make his move . [SEP]
[CLS] the program said she had one more performance near the end of the show , so i sat patiently and waited . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came out the second time , i actually sat up in my seat . [SEP]
[CLS] my back was n ' t the only thing that went ram ##rod straight . [SEP]
[CLS] though i did n ' t appreciate the comments from the other men around me that night , i had to admit that she was f * * king hot , as one of them had claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] she was dressed pretty much like one of the models ; only she ' d covered the pan ##ty and bra set with a see - through silk robe that did n ' t leave much to the imagination . [SEP]
[CLS] she outs ##hone everyone there and it helped that she actually had a body . [SEP]
[CLS] she was all smooth curves , and her legs , i could already imagine being held between them as i f * * ked her . [SEP]
[CLS] whether by providence , or fate , whatever you wan na call it , our eyes met , and in that split second i saw all i needed to know . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think anyone else caught the fa ##lter ##ing miss ##te ##p in her routine , or heard the catch in her voice , but so in tuned was i , that i did n ' t miss a thing . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 2 i waited until her number was over and the last call for the models came through the pa . then i made my excuses to my sister , who thankfully , was involved in a conversation with the woman on her other side so was n ' t paying too much attention , and therefore was n ' t in my business . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be right back sis , there ' s something i need to take care of . [SEP]
[CLS] i made my way backstage the way i do most things ; like i owned the place . [SEP]
[CLS] bypass ##ing scan ##ti ##ly clad women and harassed assistants , i avoided their hungry gazes as i kept my gaze peeled for that waterfall of cas ##ca ##ding curls . [SEP]
[CLS] she was off to the side surrounded by a be ##vy of people who were trying to hu ##stle her through a door to the back . [SEP]
[CLS] i made my way towards them and grabbed her elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked back and up and in her eyes i saw acceptance . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the push ##y woman next to her and whispered something before following me . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t really have a choice as i had no intentions on releasing my hold on her . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as i found an empty room , which turned out to be some sort of storage space , i did something i do n ' t recall having ever done before , but had been dying to for that last hour or so . [SEP]
[CLS] crowd ##ing her back against the door to keep it closed , i held her eyes as i lowered my head to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] licking across her lips , i found the taste of straw ##berries suddenly into ##xi ##cating . [SEP]
[CLS] i pushed one leg between hers and pulled her body in close as i fed her my tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck you ' re sweet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ni ##bbled from her lips to her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re coming home with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t i . . . ' ' i buried my hands in her hair , pulling her head back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever it is that you ' re about to say wo n ' t make a difference . [SEP]
[CLS] feel this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pressed her hand against her own racing heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now feel this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lifting her i pushed my c * * k into the junction of her thighs where i could feel her hot pu * * y through the silk of her clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you feel that ? [SEP]
[CLS] that means that no one and nothing is going to stand in the way of me having you . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t have to f * * k tonight , but you ' re sleeping in my bed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed overwhelmed by my approach and rested her head against my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i took the opportunity to call my sister and make my excuses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sis , i ' m sending a car for you , something came up and i have to leave . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we said our goodbye ##s and i called my driver who was having an evening off since i ' d driven my sister here tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] he had no problem with the last minute call since he knew he ' d be handsome ##ly compensated for the inc ##on ##ven ##ience . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get out of here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know how we escaped the glare of flashing cameras that night , but somehow we did . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d covered her scan ##ti ##ly clad body with my suit jacket and held her under my arm as we made our way to the valet parking where they ' d brought my bug ##att ##i around in less then five minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] i held her hand all the way to my home in the car . [SEP]
[CLS] there were no words spoken between us in the ten minutes or so it had taken for us to get there . [SEP]
[CLS] i could feel the racing of her pulse and see the apprehension in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] when i helped her out of the car in the underground garage , i pressed her up against the door and swallowed her tongue again . [SEP]
[CLS] she was young and fresh and so f * * king sweet she made me ache . [SEP]
[CLS] i loved the way she rubbed herself against my cock , almost as if she could n ' t help herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to enjoy having you under me shia ##ne . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i took her hand and led her into the building , bypass ##ing the bank of elevators to my own personal lift in the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] she kept her head down , maybe because she did n ' t want to be recognized by the door ##man and security , or maybe because she was shy , i was inclined to believe it was the latter . [SEP]
[CLS] once we got to my penthouse , she seemed shy and unsure of herself . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not one to buy into pre ##con ##ce ##ive ##d notions . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s been plenty written about me in the tabloid ##s over the years that bears no resemblance to the truth , and though i had n ' t come across anything inflammatory about her in my little impromptu search , i was sure she dealt with her fair share of bullshit . [SEP]
[CLS] i also had to take into consideration her age . [SEP]
[CLS] she was young yet , for all that she was world travelled and famous , sometimes those things could hide a multitude of things . [SEP]
[CLS] like the fact that her shy ##ness and he ##sit ##ance was not con ##tri ##ved . [SEP]
[CLS] my first order of business was to put her at ease . [SEP]
[CLS] walking over to where she stood in front of the door as if ready to escape at a moment ' s notice , i took my jacket from around her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my eyes on her bent head until i threw the jacket in the general direction of the chair in the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] then lifting her chin with the tip of my finger , i looked into her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have nothing to fear here ; it ' s like i said , we do n ' t have to f * * k each other tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i can maybe hold off until tomorrow , but i want you in my bed , in my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] what i saw tonight , i would be a fool to waste any time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , what ' s your name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i threw my head back and laughed up ##ro ##ario ##usly . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m such a beast . [SEP]
[CLS] i had n ' t even introduced myself . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a wonder she had n ' t run away screaming bloody murder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m trace mckenzie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened a bit at my name and led me to my next question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know my name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everybody knows who you are , do n ' t they ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know about everyone , but maybe a good few do . [SEP]
[CLS] can i get you something to drink ? [SEP]
[CLS] what do you usually do after a performance , which was magnificent by the way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i usually have warmed lemon and honey with a glass of water . [SEP]
[CLS] it helps keep my throat soothe ##d , but i do n ' t expect you to have that stuff here , so it ' s okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip and looked down at her feet even more shy now . [SEP]
[CLS] very end ##earing . [SEP]
[CLS] i walked over to the in house phone and called down to have them go pick me up what she needed from the all - night market a few blocks over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s taken care of . [SEP]
[CLS] it should be here in a few . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t we go out onto the patio and relax until they get here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i took her elbow and led her outside where the stars were putting on a show in the night sky . [SEP]
[CLS] i was amazed at my control , everything in me wanted in her now . [SEP]
[CLS] but somehow , i knew this , whatever it was between us would n ' t be rushed . [SEP]
[CLS] i qui ##rked my brow at my thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not one for patience and i ' d be the first to admit it . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved to sit in the chair next to mine , but i had other ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling her down into my lap , i did n ' t give her time to protest before my lips were covering hers again . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t seem to get enough of her taste . [SEP]
[CLS] she was wearing the same silk robe and underwear she ' d worn on stage and her body ' s heat sea ##red me . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the bell chimed announcing the arrival of her delivery , my hands were buried in her beautiful hair and my c * * k was digging into her hip . [SEP]
[CLS] i sat her in the seat a little dazed and went to answer the door . [SEP]
[CLS] in the kitchen i prepared the con ##co ##ction for her and had a weird sense that i was going to be doing that a lot in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s something else i never pay too much attention to , the future . [SEP]
[CLS] i usually let the chips fall where they may . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here love , i hope it ' s the way you like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took the tumble ##r from me and sipped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` umm , perfect thanks trace . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hu ##nk ##ered down in front of her and she stopped with the glass halfway to her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] i held her eyes as i tried to form the words in my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you have any upcoming engagements planned ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have three weeks until my next show , i do n ' t go on tour for another couple of months and i just wrapped up in the studio a few days ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then the next three weeks are mine . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s go to bed tomorrow is going to be a long day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i took the empty glass from her and led her inside . [SEP]
[CLS] she was back to being nervous which was totally understand ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the bedroom ' s through there with an en suite bath if you ' d like . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll find you something to sleep in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she walked on in the direction i ' d pointed out while i turned for the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] when i made it back to the bedroom she was in the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] it took everything i had in me not to go after her . [SEP]
[CLS] the night sure was turning into one for the books . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never brought a woman home for the sole purpose of just having here there . [SEP]
[CLS] she came out fifteen minutes later and i fought the kick in my heart . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked like a teenager with her hair brushed out around her shoulders and her face bare of makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] i walked over and un ##wr ##app ##ed the towel she had clutched in her fist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck me , it ' s go ##n na be a long f * * king night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was perfection . [SEP]
[CLS] her tits , which for some reason had been hidden in the robe were magnificent , i would say a dd or close , with pale pink ni * * les that almost blended into the rest of her flesh . [SEP]
[CLS] her waist was tiny , i could easily span it with my hands and her hips had a nice flare to them . [SEP]
[CLS] all woman and now all mine . [SEP]
[CLS] it was topped off with a home ##gr ##own beauty that you never see these days . [SEP]
[CLS] pink flesh with a hint of a tan on her cheeks , and the cute ##st sp ##rin ##kling of fr ##eck ##les across her perfectly up ##turn ##ed nose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see you ' re a real blonde . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her whole body lit up with her blush at my mention of the strip of hair over her pu * * y mound . [SEP]
[CLS] i kissed the top of her head as i passed her the tee shirt i ' d chosen for her to sleep in . [SEP]
[CLS] another first , i usually avoided too much familiarity with the women i dealt with . [SEP]
[CLS] having her sleep in my favorite old college shirt was very telling in deed , but we ' ll see how this plays out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be right out sweetie , you can watch tv until i ' m done or if you ' re tired go to sleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i left her standing there and went to my own shower before i went back on my word and threw her to the ground and f * * ked her the way i imagined . [SEP]
[CLS] i barely avoided rubbing one out in the shower ; just let the water beat down on me as cold as i could stand it , cooling me down a little . [SEP]
[CLS] when my felt the slight ping in my heart i held my hands out to wall and hung my head as the water cascade ##d down on me . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew what was happening to me , knew it down to my bones , should i fight it or let it take its natural course ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d never felt threatened before , in all my years of playing the filed , there was never a time when my bachelor ##hood was in danger . [SEP]
[CLS] it was too early yet , or at least that was the cr ##ut ##ch i held onto as i turned the water off and stepped out of the marble shower stall . [SEP]
[CLS] wrapping a towel around my hips and grabbing another i walked into the bedroom to find her asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] my new baby was tired . [SEP]
[CLS] i stood over her , taking in the softness of her beauty in sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder how many people had ever seen this side of her . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a brief stab of jealousy at the thought of the boy she ' d been linked with . [SEP]
[CLS] i ran my fingers gently through her hair , going softly so i did n ' t awake ##n her . [SEP]
[CLS] i shook my head at myself after i leaned over and kissed her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so f * * king beautiful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whispered the words in her ear before heading to the closet for some boxer shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] no sleeping in the buff tonight , i ' d changed the game plan somewhere between seeing her on that stage and handing her that tee shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i was tread ##ing un ##cha ##rter ##ed waters here , so we ' ll play it by ear , but there ' s always been one constant with me throughout my lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] i always play to win . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t help drawing her into my arms when i finally crawled into bed . [SEP]
[CLS] she just cu ##ddled into my chest and settled , just like this kitten i once had as a child . [SEP]
[CLS] what the f * * k ? [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t thought of my f * * ked up childhood or anything to do with it in a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] i looked down at the head on my chest and felt fear for the first time in my life , or at least for the first time in forever . [SEP]
[CLS] what was i to do with this new thing that was growing inside of me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i have no notion of how to deal with love and all its trapping ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m man enough to own my feelings , but logical enough , grounded enough not to believe in love at first sight . [SEP]
[CLS] but this whatever it was that had hit me from out of left field , was a close second . [SEP]
[CLS] i fell asleep with the thought of what tomorrow might bring for us . [SEP]
[CLS] first time in thirteen years , that i did n ' t close my eyes with a spreads ##hee ##t running through my head . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 3 in the morning my eyes popped open to land on hers as she looked up at me from her place on my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` morning beautiful girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i drew her in for a cu ##ddle and to sniff the morning scent of her skin . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt right in my arms , in my bed . [SEP]
[CLS] when i pulled back she was looking at me ask ##ance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is so weird , i hope you do n ' t think i ' m in the habit of going home with strange men . . . ' ' ` ` whatever you did or did not do before we met last night is in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i do n ' t remember giving you much of a choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m go ##n na kiss you now sweet shia ##ne , do n ' t worry about my hard cock , it ca n ' t seem to help doing that around you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i turned her onto her back and covered her body with mine . [SEP]
[CLS] starting at her ear i kissed my way down her jaw ##line to the corner of her mouth before taking soft ni ##bble ##s of her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t force my way in this time , but made her want my tongue so much that she was the one who came in search of it . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the one who took my face in her hands and forced my lips open with her tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] i told myself to go easy even as i pressed my aching c * * k into her heat . [SEP]
[CLS] her shirt had ridden up so that all that stood between us were a few scrap ##s of silk . [SEP]
[CLS] my control lasted for all of ten seconds before i was eating at her lips , my hands roaming all over her body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck , f * * k , f * * k . . . shia ##ne . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i buried my face in her neck and prayed for the strength to leave it there , not to push her panties aside and slip into her heat that i knew was going to own my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] when she nu ##zzled my head and squeezed me between her legs , i knew the ji ##g was up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` baby we got ta get up ; i ' m trying to keep my word here but you ' re not making it easy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sucked the skin of her neck between my teeth and rocked my c * * k back and forth into her , my c * * k ring hitting her clit with each stroke and driving me insane . [SEP]
[CLS] she hissed and shook beneath me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck baby do n ' t do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gritted my teeth and rolled away with my arm thrown over my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck ! [SEP]
[CLS] get off the bed baby . . . please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hesitated for a minute before i felt her leave the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not f * * king happening to me . [SEP]
[CLS] how the f * * k was this happening to me ? [SEP]
[CLS] when i felt my breathing calm enough and my dick was down to a slow th ##ro ##b instead of a raging pulse , i lifted my hand and looked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked so f * * king young and innocent standing there , unsure of the crazy man who ' d dragged her off to his lair in the middle of the night and was now acting like an ass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry baby if you ' d stayed here one second more i would ' ve f * * ked you . [SEP]
[CLS] since i kinda gave my word i do n ' t want to go back on it . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s no way to start thin ##s off . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s saturday morning , you said you do n ' t really have anything pressing on the calendar so i ' ll tell you what we ' re go ##n na do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty sure if we went anywhere in this city you ' d be recognized in five minutes flat am i right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah pretty much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you did n ' t bring any clothes with you obviously , so going out to breakfast was pretty much out anyway , for now at least . [SEP]
[CLS] so . . . i ' m go ##n na go downstairs and make us some breakfast sounds good ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i studied her as she stood there with her hair all mu ##ssed from my fingers , my mark forming on her neck and the shirt hanging off her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the sex ##iest f * * king thing i ' d ever seen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i changed my mind come ' er ##e . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she made a running leap for the bed and landed on top of me , causing my eyes to open in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] the smile that broke out across my face was another shared first as i pulled her head down and clasp ##ing her there , took her lips in another wild kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] she kissed like an innocent and i found it thrilling to teach her my showing her how to chase my tongue with hers . [SEP]
[CLS] my c * * k was leaking prof ##use ##ly at this point as i enjoyed running my tongue around the inside of her mouth , over her teeth , and lips before diving back in . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a long time since i ' d dry hum ##ped anyone , but f * * k if that is n ' t what i found myself doing . [SEP]
[CLS] with one hand clasped behind her head and the other holding her ass in place , i moved her body over mine , while my c * * k started leaking even more into my shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to turn her over onto her back and just take her , but i did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] instead i pressed her cu ##nt harder into my aching c * * k and ground our pe ##lvis ##es together . [SEP]
[CLS] she moaned into my mouth and quiver ##ed as i felt the first burst of cum leave my sp ##ew ##ing cock . [SEP]
[CLS] we laid still until our breathing went back to normal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think a shower is in order do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sat up with her still in my lap and rolled out of bed , headed for the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] shia ##ne i ca n ' t believe i ' m doing this . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing like this has ever happened to me before , but when i ' d looked into his eyes last night while on stage , there was something there that called to me , what that was i still was n ' t sure , but somehow i knew i would be a fool to let it pass . [SEP]
[CLS] i would ' ve gone on as usual if he had n ' t approached me , i ' m not bold enough to have sought him out . [SEP]
[CLS] but now that i was here i was n ' t sure of my moves . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve only ever been with one guy , someone i met when i first started my music career . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d saved myself all through high school , holding out for that special someone . [SEP]
[CLS] and then after i ' d been discovered , i ' d been too busy in the studio and with other engagements to think about a relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been into the casual scene , so when i met donnie , i ' d thought i ' d found my soul mate . [SEP]
[CLS] someone i could spend my life with . [SEP]
[CLS] that was before i ' d overheard him making plans to hook up with someone else . [SEP]
[CLS] that day was the lowest point of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] when i ' d confronted him after coming out of the bathroom unexpectedly and overheard him , he ' d grown angry . [SEP]
[CLS] angry enough to hit me for questioning him ; then he ' d filled me in on the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d only been with me because it was good for his career . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought that being linked to the hottest new number on the music scene would open doors for him , which it did . [SEP]
[CLS] he called me a stupid little farm girl with rose - colored glasses . [SEP]
[CLS] as he put it , everyone was doing it ; it was known part of the business . [SEP]
[CLS] people f * * ked one another to get ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] when i ' d stupid ##ly told him i thought we would get married like we ' d talked about he ' d laughed in my face . [SEP]
[CLS] it was then that my love had started to die . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t die completely until news of our split got out and i learned that this was n ' t the first time he ' d cheated , and that everyone thought i knew . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently they thought i was doing the same . [SEP]
[CLS] i was never so humiliated in my life , all our friends , if you can call them that ; had known . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d slipped out of the spotlight for a while until my management told me i had to appear with the snake for publicity sake because of prior agreements and the album we ' d collaborated on together . [SEP]
[CLS] so for a few months the world thought we were an item again . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hard , especially when he cornered me one day after rehearsal and said we could just pick up where we left off , i was an okay f * * k after all . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t even know this person . [SEP]
[CLS] all i could do was walk away in disgust . [SEP]
[CLS] since then he ' d called me a few times , he knew i was n ' t seeing anyone and since he ' d been my first somehow this little farm girl should just overlook his in ##fide ##lity and turn a blind eye , because according to him i was never going to find better , because everybody in the business cheat ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] now here i am , not even a month later doing something i never thought in a million years i would ever do . [SEP]
[CLS] when i opened my eyes this morning and saw him there , his face relaxed in sleep , so perfectly handsome . [SEP]
[CLS] the first thing that caught my attention was the tattoos on his chest and arms . [SEP]
[CLS] the business suit sure had n ' t prepared me for that , or for what i was sure was a piercing in his cock . [SEP]
[CLS] of course i knew who he was , everyone did , the self - made billionaire who ' d come from nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] his story was told far and wide in all circles . [SEP]
[CLS] a male cinderella story if you will . [SEP]
[CLS] from what i remember his parents had been poor , from some place in the midwest . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d boxed in high school and gained a scholarship to an ivy league university where he ' d continued his boxing career but had focused more on his studies . [SEP]
[CLS] then he ' d invented some game software and used the money from that to start his own securities firm . [SEP]
[CLS] they called him the wonder kid of wall street . [SEP]
[CLS] though kid was n ' t exactly accurate . [SEP]
[CLS] he put me down in the bathroom long enough to start the shower before he turned back to me and lifted the worn tee shirt over my head . [SEP]
[CLS] i was embarrassed as he pulled my panties down my thighs and when i stepped out of them and he picked them up and brought them up to his face , i thought my body would go up in flames . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes held mine as he lowered them and then he was pulling me back into that hard chest of his again and our mouths mated . [SEP]
[CLS] he dropped his shorts while our tongues were playing tag and turned me towards the huge marble stall . [SEP]
[CLS] no words were spoken as he soap ##ed up his hands and washed by body . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands glided over me , slowly , taking his time as he touched my body , as though he were paying homage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love your body baby , so f * * king much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed h ##yp ##not ##ized with by my chest , which until the look in his eyes , had always been a source of embarrassment for me . [SEP]
[CLS] they were just too . . . everything . [SEP]
[CLS] but that way he touched them made me feel beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get up here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he picked me up so that my legs went around his waist and his mouth covered mine once more as my now slippery body slid all over his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the hardness of his c * * k pressing into my ass up to the small of my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a moment ' s pause at the length of him . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way that thing would ever fit inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have to stop baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a few more ni ##bble ##s of my lips before letting me slip down his body . [SEP]
[CLS] we finished our shower after he ' d passed me the soap to return the favor . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart all but flew out of my chest as i ran my hands over his beautiful chest . [SEP]
[CLS] my face heated up as i leaned over and kissed his chest and i felt a sense of power when his body shook . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned off the water and led me out of the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing a towel he dried me before going to a door in the bathroom that led to a closet of sorts . [SEP]
[CLS] he came back with a long silk robe that obviously belonged to him , and one for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] downstairs in the kitchen he kissed me once more before seating me on a stool at the island and turning to the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` an om ##ele ##t okay princess ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , sounds great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] princess , how did he know that i ' ve always wanted someone to call me that ? [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t have , so that was just another sign that there was something going on here that went beyond the obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] he plate ##d the om ##ele ##ts and sat down across from me after pouring us both cups of coffee from his state of the art coffee maker . [SEP]
[CLS] i studied the kitchen for something to so instead of staring at his chest that was exposed by the gap in his robe . [SEP]
[CLS] i could stare at it all , or his beautiful face with those ce ##ru ##lean blue eyes that seemed to dark ##en whenever he looked at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` today is saturday , monday morning we ' re going to my private doctor to have tests done . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i think you ' re unsafe , this is for both of us . [SEP]
[CLS] when i take you there will be nothing between us and i want you to be comfortable with the fact that i ' m clean as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see from the gossip rags that you ' ve only had one serious relationship since you came onto the music scene , tell me about that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laid my fork down and folded my arms around my middle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want to know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it almost sounded like a growl . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my head down ; surely this was a bit personal for two people who ' d only just met ; more personal than cum ##ming all over him and he you you ni ##nn ##y ? [SEP]
[CLS] i blushed at the memory and felt my body shudder . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost jumped out of my skin when his finger lifted my chin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now ' s not the time to think about what i can and will do to you sweetie , we need to clear some things up first ; eat your breakfast . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i told him about meeting donnie , about my childhood in the southwest and the life i ' d left behind to follow my dream of becoming a singer , the years of hard work before the pay ##off . [SEP]
[CLS] the supportive family who was still very much a part of my life and whom i stayed in contact with by weekly phone calls and sky ##pe chat ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] of course i left out the most embarrassing details of my messy break - up with donnie . [SEP]
[CLS] no one outside our circle knew the real reason behind the break , but i knew it was only a matter of time before that was no longer a secret . [SEP]
[CLS] but somehow i could n ' t find it in me to tell this vi ##ril ##e man who looked at me like i was the hottest sex object on the planet , that i had been such an ab ##ject failure ; or that i had been such a gu ##lli ##ble , green fool . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you love him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i looked up at him then , there was something in his voice , something i could n ' t quite place but it sounded menacing somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] i swallowed hard before i answered him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i did , but now i ' m not sure what i was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i was caught up in the excitement of my new life and he was the first interesting guy to ever pay me any attention , or the first one that i noticed anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you two still stay in touch ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , only if we ' re working on one of our songs or something that calls for us to work together in a professional capacity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and how often does that happen ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we just did an album together . [SEP]
[CLS] it was finished just before we broke up . [SEP]
[CLS] we might have to perform the songs together at awards shows and things like that in the future , i ' m not sure of anything right now though . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s something we ' ll have to deal with , something you should know before we go any farther . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a very territorial about my possessions . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t share shia ##ne , not ever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i find myself in new territory here though , because i ' ve never cared about a woman ' s past before , never cared how many partners she had before me . [SEP]
[CLS] with you i find that i hate this boy for having had you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s silly i know , since you know of me , then you know that i ' ve not been a monk myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know why i should feel this way , it just is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t say anything to that , what was there to say ? [SEP]
[CLS] like he said i ' d read of his exploits along with the rest of america . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a known lady ' s man . [SEP]
[CLS] not necessarily a skirt chase ##r , it seems they were usually the ones doing the chasing . [SEP]
[CLS] none of his encounters if i remember correctly had ever lasted more than a few months at the most . [SEP]
[CLS] is that what he was after now ? [SEP]
[CLS] because if it was , as much as i felt that strong pull for him , i do n ' t think i was ready for a fling . [SEP]
[CLS] something of my inner thoughts must ' ve shown on my face because he brought my attention back to him with his next words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop worrying , like i told you , whatever was in the past is just that , the past . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] could i ask him outright what his intentions were , or would he find the question ga ##uche and immature ? [SEP]
[CLS] that as something else donnie had accused me of . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d said that my ideals were old and outdated . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently it was against the new social norm to actually want to have a meaningful relationship that lasted longer than the time it took to scratch an it ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you said there were some things that we needed to clear up before we went any farther , well i think you should know i ' m not into casual fling ##s , i . . . ' ' ` ` i think i got that princess . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t say anything else for the longest while , just studied me over his coffee mug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know where this is going , not exactly , but i do know there is n ' t going to be anything casual about it . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 4 trace i did n ' t take her home until later that evening . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d turned her phone off at about noon after it had run ##g for the tenth time in half an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] i had her send off a quick text to her assistant so that they knew she was alive and that was it . [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed a bit panicked at first and i knew the feeling , since i ' d once been sync ##ed with my phone and any form of communication , until i ' d learned to compartment ##ali ##ze . [SEP]
[CLS] we spent the time getting to know each other , when i was n ' t kissing her . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t risk getting too hot and heavy with her again , because i did n ' t trust myself to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] when i take her i want to feel her pu * * y around my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i have never in my life f * * ked a woman without some kind of protection and definitely not without a condom . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t look too deeply at my reasons for wanting to do it with her . [SEP]
[CLS] all i know is that the memory of her on that stage the night before , the jolt that had gone through me when our eyes connected , was something that i was n ' t willing to brush aside . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve spent my life following my gut and hu ##nche ##s that others had scoffed at , only to come out on top . [SEP]
[CLS] this just might be the biggest f * * king hu ##nch i ever play in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] if the beautiful girl that was sitting on my lap in my living room , dressed only in one of my robes , knew the thoughts that were going through my head i ' m not sure she would n ' t have been looking for the nearest exit . [SEP]
[CLS] everything about her called to something in me , something i had n ' t known was there . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time i took her home to her apartment on the other side of the park i was second guessing myself . [SEP]
[CLS] outside her apartment i looked for a parking spot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to walk me up you know , i ' m perfectly safe here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no deal princess , i ' m contemplating turning around and taking you back home , the only reason i ' m not is because you do n ' t have anything to wear and i ' m sure you have stuff to take care of . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' m coming up with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not ready for our first date to be over just yet . [SEP]
[CLS] she blushed and smiled and reached over to kiss me but then seemed to think better of it . [SEP]
[CLS] so i was the one who held her head and pulled her the rest of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] if there were any cameras around i did n ' t care in that moment . [SEP]
[CLS] though i understood her concerns , she ' d explained about how precious her privacy had become since she ' d found star ##dom , how the simplest thing like running out for a cart ##on of milk had now become a monumental task . [SEP]
[CLS] that was something else i was going to have to take care of . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t sure from what she ' d said , what kind of security detail she had on a daily basis . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean look how easy it had been for me to get to her and literally take her out of their hands . [SEP]
[CLS] on top of her own star status , being linked with me might put her even more in the spotlight , so i was go ##n na have to take care of that first thing . [SEP]
[CLS] i helped her out of the car and through the doors . [SEP]
[CLS] she was wearing a pair of my jeans rolled at the ankles and around the waist , but of course she ' d made it look like a fashion statement . [SEP]
[CLS] we made it up to her apartment with no interruption ##s and i was still holding her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i loved the look of her place , it was open space and air ##y with windows all around with a view of the park and a bit of the city skyline . [SEP]
[CLS] it was nothing like mine , but it was n ' t sha ##bby either . [SEP]
[CLS] i saw little touches of her here , in the bright colors and soft throw pillows that she seemed to have a fond ##ness for . [SEP]
[CLS] she was back to being shy again but at lease it seemed to stem more from what i thought of her place this time . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d spent the day practically locked together in every way but one , so most of her re ##tic ##ence had melted away somewhat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like it . [SEP]
[CLS] grab some stuff you ' re coming back with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you . . . i thought you said you were br ##ining me home to take care of stuff and you ' ll see me on monday ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i looked down at her as she turned that little innocent face up to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did say that baby , but i changed my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not ready for us to be apart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i had the fleeting thought that i may never be ready for that again , but squash ##ed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you need help packing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i thought i saw a bit of a smile touch the corners of her lips before she shook her head no . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i at least check my messages first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she walked over to the machine and hit play as she dropped into a chair . [SEP]
[CLS] i walked over to the bank of windows with my hands stuffed in my pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] the first few messages were just business as usual , but then coming onto the end there was some guy , maybe her manager who seemed very ira ##te that he could n ' t get ah ##old of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you said you did n ' t have anything plan for the next little while ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t that ' s just carl ' s way , he likes to know where i am at all times . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it sounded like a bit more than that to me , but i let it got for now . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a grown man , so that means when she ' s with me this carl person could go f * * k himself , because i did n ' t need anyone keeping tab ##s on me . [SEP]
[CLS] there was nothing else worrying on there and she headed into her bedroom to pack after offering me a drink , which i turned down . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wanted out of there and back home as soon as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow i felt easier with her in my bed , behind my walls . [SEP]
[CLS] she came back out with an overnight bag and dressed in a pair of her own jeans and a pull ##over . [SEP]
[CLS] i took the bag and with her hand in mine headed for the door . [SEP]
[CLS] monday morning i had to go in early to the office , so i eased her out of my arms and went to the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] she was still out by the time i was dressed and ready to go so i leaned over the bed and kissed her awake . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm ##m . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed into my mouth as she awakened with my tongue in hers . [SEP]
[CLS] i ended up sitting on the side of the bed and pulling her into my lap for a longer kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] truth is i hated the thought of leaving her . [SEP]
[CLS] the last two days had been like none i ' d ever shared and we had n ' t even left the house except to go to her place . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d spent all day sunday la ##zing around in bed reading the paper , talking or making out . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d already called my doctor and made the appointments adding pressure for him to rush the results which he assured me can be done . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you in a couple hours princess , the car will come and get you around ten thirty , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i kissed her nose when she nodded against my chest and got up to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t look back at her there in my bed in my old rat ##ty tee shirt , i was sure i would n ' t want to leave her if i did . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was time to send the car for her i changed my plans and instead of meeting her there i went after her myself . [SEP]
[CLS] she was putting on her shoes when i came through the door and when she saw me standing there , f * * k me if her whole face did n ' t light up and she made a running leap and jumped into the arms i had opened for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey beautiful , you missed me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sniffed my neck and nodded before i pulled her head around for my lips to find hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' d better go , john promised me that if we did this early he could possibly get us the results by end of day today and i ' m afraid if we do n ' t i ' m go ##n na f * * king explode . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled her down just enough for her to feel the evidence of my need . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no doubts that she was clean and i was sure that i was , but somehow i wanted this , wanted us to start things off on the right foot . [SEP]
[CLS] i ignored the little voice in my head that told me there was an ul ##ter ##ior motive behind my actions . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way i was thinking along those lines , no way in hell . [SEP]
[CLS] shia ##ne i wondered if he was always this at ##ten ##tive , or if as with all things new , this would change once he got what he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] will he start taking advantage of me as time went on ? [SEP]
[CLS] he was like no other man i ' d ever known , except for maybe one . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d seen my dad treat my mom like a precious gem my whole life . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s where i ' d got my dream of a prince charming . [SEP]
[CLS] not from any story ##book , but from the way i ' d seen my dad look at mom when he thought no one else was looking . [SEP]
[CLS] or the way she was always looking to him when things went south . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d taught me to want that bond , to hold out for that and nothing less . [SEP]
[CLS] trace seemed to have that in him , but i ' d been burnt once and my heart was a little gun shy . [SEP]
[CLS] it had only been a few weeks since it was shattered after all . [SEP]
[CLS] but here i was with sweaty palms and weak knees over this guy that i barely knew . [SEP]
[CLS] the weekend had been the best one i ' d had in a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact i have n ' t felt that relaxed since the last time i ' d taken a trip home . [SEP]
[CLS] neither of us seemed ready for the intrusion of the world just yet . [SEP]
[CLS] we wanted to enjoy getting to know each other without all the speculation and other nonsense that came with star ##dom . [SEP]
[CLS] downstairs there were two men in suits who looked like they ' d never smiled a day in their lives . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is your security , i ' m sure you have some already for business purposes , but these two are from me . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ll shadow everywhere when i ' m not with you . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes widened at that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that really necessary ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not that big of a star yet i do n ' t think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tried laughing it off as he introduced me to the two and pulled me out the doors behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this has nothing to do with your status , it ' s for my peace of mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i started to wonder if this was something he ' d done for all the women in his past and why that should make me jealous . [SEP]
[CLS] he squeezed my hand and looked down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you ' re the first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you know what i was thinking ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you , the weekend was about getting to know each other , i picked up a few things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smirked as he helped me into the back of the town car . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d told him of my fear of needles so he held my hand and talked to me while the doctor and the nurse did their thing , before having his taken care of . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t take that long and soon we were back in the car . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m taking you to the office for a quick tour and then it ' s lunch . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll go somewhere that i ' m sure we ' d be left alone , i ' m not quite ready to share us yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i rested my head on his shoulder and squeezed his hand that was still holding onto mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i think he must ' ve planned this and warned everyone in the building not to give me the star treatment because i saw a lot of interested looks from his employees , but no one said anything more than a friendly hello . [SEP]
[CLS] it was great . [SEP]
[CLS] lunch was in a private room in one of the city ' s more upscale restaurants where there were more a list stars than i ' d ever seen in one place at once except maybe an awards show . [SEP]
[CLS] i was the one star - struck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes it is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i must ' ve said that a hundred times before we were seated . [SEP]
[CLS] i crane ##d my neck to see into the other room and he laughed at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so cute . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re looking at you and you ' re in awe of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty sure they ' re all wondering who i am , it ' s you they ' re looking at . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t sure i was too far off the mark , most of them were star ##lets and they might ' ve given me the once over , but their attention was definitely on him . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t blame them . [SEP]
[CLS] what he did for a suit should be illegal . [SEP]
[CLS] and to think that what was underneath was even more mouth watering ##ly spectacular . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 5 trace i sent her home in the car and went back to work , my mind on the results and how soon i can have them in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost called john when the hours had drifted by and still no phone call . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of day when it was almost time to call it quit ##s , the messenger showed up with the envelope ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no com ##pu ##nction about tearing into hers and reading the results . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as i got the all clear my body reacted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank f * * k ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i left my office almost at a run . [SEP]
[CLS] my assistant called out to me as i was heading for the elevators . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it a matter of life or death susan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh no sir . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then it ' ll keep until tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stepped in and pressed the down button . [SEP]
[CLS] i would ' ve called her and let her know i was on the way but even that was too much right now . [SEP]
[CLS] if i heard that sul ##try voice of hers on the phone i might em ##bar ##ras ##s myself again . [SEP]
[CLS] i was on a hair trigger , the slightest thing would set me off , and the next time i cum , i want to be inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she came running when i cleared the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey you ' re home i made din . . . ' ' i threw the envelope ##s on the little side table near the entry and grabbed her up in my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` later . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth came down on hers as i walked us blindly towards the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t even stop kissing her long enough to take off the little summer ##y top and shorts she wore . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` und ##ress me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her hands shook a little as she went after my tie and then the buttons of my shirt while i dropped my jacket on the floor and kicked off my shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed fascinated with the ink on my torso , and could n ' t help running her tongue over it , so i took care of my belt and the zipper on my pants before she stopped me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i wan na do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i released it and left her to it . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d learned my body in the last tow days , as much as i would let her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d refused to let her take my c * * k in her mouth so she ' d spent what felt like hours measuring me in her hands and teasing the shit out of me while i sucked her ni * * les and finger f * * ked her . [SEP]
[CLS] now she got to her knees and removed my socks . [SEP]
[CLS] i watched her through half slit ##ted eyes as she looked up at me with a mischievous twinkle in her eye , right before her tongue came out and licked the pr * * cum from my cock ##head . [SEP]
[CLS] my body jerked and my hands fell to her hair , holding her in place as she licked and ni ##bbled her way down my shaft , biting into my c * * k ring , before taking half of me into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i threw my head back as she massage ##d my c * * k with her throat muscles and she had great control from all the voice exercises she ' d done over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] i was almost ready to pop when she took my balls in her hand and caressed them with the light ##est touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s enough , i do n ' t want to cum in your mouth , not this first time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] picking her up , i headed for the bed and laid her back with her legs sp ##lay ##ed open . [SEP]
[CLS] i had n ' t allowed myself the pleasure of studying her pu * * y ; i was waiting for this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] kneeling on the floor i ran my nose over her wet heat before pulling back and opening her up with my fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] she was pink and soft and wet . [SEP]
[CLS] i teased her with the tip of my tongue , before licking deep into her pu * * y . [SEP]
[CLS] her back bowed off the bed and she looked down at me in wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] i got the idea from her reaction that this was a first for her . [SEP]
[CLS] holding her ass in my hands i lifted her to my mouth and tongue f * * ked her while she me ##wled and writ ##hed , her fingers digging into my scalp . [SEP]
[CLS] her taste was unlike anything i ' d ever sa ##vor ##ed before , salty sweet and fresh . [SEP]
[CLS] she came on my tongue and filled my mouth with her sweet nectar . [SEP]
[CLS] i had visions of eating her sweet pu * * y for hours , just burying my face in her cu ##nt until they cart ##ed me away . [SEP]
[CLS] my c * * k was n ' t on board for that one though . [SEP]
[CLS] i had to release one of her ass cheeks so i could squeeze him to get some relief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry baby , this is go ##n na be hard and rough , i ca n ' t wait any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] climbing up her body i pulled her up higher on the bed and holding both her hands above her head , our eyes locked , i led my dick into her wet opening . [SEP]
[CLS] she was tight as f * * k and my c * * k almost buckled . [SEP]
[CLS] she flinched a little when i pushed the fat head of my c * * k past her pu * * y lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck babe , you ' re so f * * king tight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i had to raise her legs so i could sink more of my c * * k home and even then i was only able to get eight of the twelve inches inside . [SEP]
[CLS] she hissed and clenched around me , her eyes widening in surprise as i tried to force more of my meat into her tight as f * * k pu * * y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll try to go slow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lifting her ass i opened her pu * * y more , screwing myself into her little by little until i was all in . [SEP]
[CLS] it felt like hours instead of mere minutes when i was finally buried to the hilt inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as my balls hit the crack of her ass i took her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] she fought to release her arms but i held firm . [SEP]
[CLS] bending my head i sucked first one then the other nipple into my mouth , biting her in my lust crazed haze . [SEP]
[CLS] she f * * king flooded my c * * k and screamed . [SEP]
[CLS] i f * * ked in and out of her like a beast , her pu * * y ' s tight grip driving me insane . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs came up and around my waist , drawing me in deeper with every thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] i finally released her arms so i could touch her body and she clutched at me , her nails digging into my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t seem to get deep enough in her , i wanted to imprint myself in her deeply , the thought moving me to lift her legs over my shoulders and bore into her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is mine , no one else ' s ever again ; only mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pushed my tongue into her mouth , not giving her a chance to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] it would n ' t have mattered anyway ; it was a done f * * king deal . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt the familiar tingle up my spine but fought off my orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to leave her body so soon , wanted to stay enclosed in her wet heat for eternity . [SEP]
[CLS] when the bed started knocking into the wall behind us , and her grunt ##s became long drawn out moans , i knew she was close again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cum for me baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i latch ##ed onto her neck with my teeth and sucked hard , leaving my mark there before moving to the flesh right above her left nipple and doing the same . [SEP]
[CLS] my sweet girl squeezed my c * * k between her pu * * y walls and i felt the heat of her pu * * y juice as she bathed my c * * k once more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ##ss ##ss ##ss . . . ' ' her long drawn out hiss only made the fever burn hotter . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to f * * k her from behind , but did n ' t want to leave her body long enough to change positions . [SEP]
[CLS] instead i teased her little rose ##bu ##d with my finger ##tip and felt the answering tightening around my cock ; she liked that . [SEP]
[CLS] i used the lu ##bri ##cation of her juice ##s to coat my fingers and pushed one , then two into her ass up to the first kn ##uck ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost bit off my tongue that i ' d just shoved back in her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination was too much for me and i roared into her mouth as i emptied my seed deep inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t done there though , i ground my pe ##lvis into hers , flex ##ing my still shooting c * * k inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] her response had me pulling my mouth away from hers to look down into her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were glazed over and half closed , her mouth open in a silent scream ; but it had been the elect ##ri ##fying shaking of her body beneath me that had caught my attention . [SEP]
[CLS] she was sight of want ##onne ##ss as i took her in , and i was n ' t surprised to feel my c * * k harden ##ing once more inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you take me again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i asked the question but i knew there was no way i was stopping now . [SEP]
[CLS] i had three days build up to work off . [SEP]
[CLS] the sheets were already drenched beneath us as i bent my knees and pulled her up into my chest so we could reverse positions . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my knees bent behind her back as she sat up in the cradle of my lap , mu c * * k going deeper up into her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me your nipple baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned over like she barely had the strength to do even that and i sucked her nipple in hard as i used my hands on her hips to help her f * * k herself on my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mirror across from the bed , i could see where we were joined , see the glistening length of my c * * k as it slid in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] her ass inc ##ited me to madness and i bit down on her nipple even as i sped up my thrusts , pounding up into her . [SEP]
[CLS] she flooded my pe ##lvis and lower stomach with more of her pu * * y juice and i lost it , biting into her flesh as she rode out the storm with me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ar ##gg ##gh ##hh ##h . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled her down hard one last time as my c * * k spat more sperm inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she fell to the side limp , her hand cupping her pu * * y as her body shook with after shocks . [SEP]
[CLS] i was breathing like i ' d just run a marathon , but i had enough strength in me to reach over and touch her . [SEP]
[CLS] her body was on fire , and the way she rolled around clutching herself led me to believe i ' d hurt her . [SEP]
[CLS] i got off the bed after kissing her shoulder and headed into the bathroom to run her a bath when i got back into the bedroom she was just laying there looking dazed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is your pu * * y sore ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blushed and buried her face in the pillow . [SEP]
[CLS] i grinned and picked her up and she did her kitten curl into my chest and nu ##zzled me . [SEP]
[CLS] i kissed her hair as i walked us into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t trust myself to get into the tub with her , so instead i placed her inside and picked up the wash ##cloth to bath ##e her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t said a word since i ' d finished f * * king her so and i was beginning to think she was pole ##ax ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you okay princess ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned glazed eyes my way and gave me a little half smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what was that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what was what sweetie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ran the wash ##cloth over her tits , taking great care with her beautiful ni * * les that were still semi erect , before working the cloth down her middle to her pu * * y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that just happened in there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her face heated up again and i could n ' t resist stealing a quick kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were n ' t a virgin babe so i know you know what sex is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she started shaking her head before i was through speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was n ' t se trace , that was , wow , shit , wow . . . ' ' she blushed and hid behind her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grinned at her as i used the wash ##cloth to rub against her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] she arched her back , pushing her cu ##nt into my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i could actually feel her heat beneath the cloth as i cupped her pu * * y mound . [SEP]
[CLS] i dropped the cloth in the water and teased her swollen clit with my fingers while sucking her tongue into my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] so much for giving her a break ! [SEP]
[CLS] water went all over the floor as i lifted her from the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] my c * * k was at full staff and leading the a ##y as i cradled her in my arms and took her back to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i walked around to the other side since that one was wet . [SEP]
[CLS] thank f * * k for king sized beds . [SEP]
[CLS] again i did n ' t want to give up her mouth or her tits to f * * k her dogg ##ie style so i took her down to the mattress with my body covering hers . [SEP]
[CLS] reaching my hand between us , i used my c * * k to rub up and down her slit , hitting her clit with each upward stroke and rubbing the sensitive underside of my c * * k against her wet heat until i slipped into her in my last downward stroke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ##h . . . ' ' her soft sigh broke the silence as i started f * * king in and out of her , slowly this time . [SEP]
[CLS] i told myself that i would go slow if it killed me , that i would n ' t hurt her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was tough but i held on . [SEP]
[CLS] with my face buried in her neck , i rode her nice and slow as she lifted up to meet my thrusts over and over again . [SEP]
[CLS] i alternate ##d between deep stroking into her and grinding my c * * k into her belly . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs opened wider and i slipped even deeper into her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a long time before i felt the familiar stirring ##s in my nuts again . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth was red and swollen from me eating at her lips and her neck was a mess from the five or six hi ##ckey ##s i ' d given her . [SEP]
[CLS] looking down at her my heart jumped in my chest with all the things i imagined doing to her . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thought had me speeding up as i started pounding into her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not on birth control . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bit her ear after reminding her of that fact but there was more yet to come . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re o ##vu ##lating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s amazing what they can find in those medical tests these days . [SEP]
[CLS] her breath caught as though she ' d just thought of it , but even more telling was the way her cu ##nt tightened around my shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] i roared out loud as i shot a heavy load inside her , my last thought being that i ' d lost my f * * king mind . [SEP]
[CLS] one look , it had taken one look at her to take me over . [SEP]
[CLS] how was that even possible ? [SEP]
[CLS] for a man like me it was n ' t even worth thinking on . [SEP]
[CLS] i would never have believed in a million years that something like this could ever happen to someone like me . [SEP]
[CLS] cynical , do n ' t give a f * * k and a beast in the board ##room ; love and marriage was nowhere on my horizon ; until three nights ago when i ' d looked into her eyes across a stage . [SEP]
[CLS] i stayed buried inside her as we came down so it was a minute or two before i realized that she was out . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling out of her body , i drew her into my arms as i fell to my side beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] the cool air of the ac dried my nuts as i pulled the sheet up over us and dropped into sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] we awakened a short time later and took a shower to clean up and then had to take another after i violated her up against the shower stall . [SEP]
[CLS] i had n ' t planned to , but seeing her with water dripping down between her amazing tits and pe ##bbled on her ni * * les , it was pretty hard to resist . [SEP]
[CLS] i was careful as i lifted her with her back to the stall and surged up into her , dropping her down on my length . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been years since i ' d f * * ked anyone that long and that often , in fact i do n ' t think i ' d ever gone four times before and i still was n ' t done . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if each time only w ##hett ##ed my appetite for more . [SEP]
[CLS] and the way she responded to me , accepting and ready each time i took her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you want to get any rest tonight and maybe wan na walk anytime soon , you ' d better stop me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whispered in her ear as i ni ##bbled my way down to her neck and back . [SEP]
[CLS] my c * * k was still hard inside her and i ' d just off loaded in her for the fourth time . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs were still clasped around my hips as i kept her pinned against the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] her answer was to pull my lips over to hers and smash her tits into my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] as the water beat down on us , i took her down to the hard floor and started f * * king her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is f * * king insane . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] was it because i ' d slept with her in my arms for three whole nights and not taken her ? [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t think of a reason for this hunger that would n ' t be ass ##ua ##ged . [SEP]
[CLS] the more i had her the more i wanted , but if we kept this shit up she ' d spend the next three weeks bed ridden . [SEP]
[CLS] already i had noticed the red puff ##iness to her lab ##ia and heard the slight sounds of discomfort she made even as she spurred me on to f * * k her . [SEP]
[CLS] i was sure i was killing her against the marble floor , the grunt ##s and groans she made were becoming almost animal ##istic , but she threw her hips up at me taking my c * * k like a pro as i did my best to nail her into her ground beneath us . [SEP]
[CLS] this time when i came the roar was more like a grunt as i shook and thrust into her until i was dry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s it , we ' re getting out of here , please try to keep your greedy hands to yourself shia ##ne , my poor man ' s body can only take so much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she threw herself into my arms and howled with laughter and i felt my heart give a little more . [SEP]
[CLS] we finally made it out of the bathroom and both just threw on robes as we headed down to the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you say you made dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she went to the pots and pan ##s on the stove and i lifted my brow quiz ##zic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i was guilty of stereo typing after all , i had n ' t expected the little pop sensation to know her way around the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d made a dinner of grille ##d lamb chop ##s of all things , with rice pi ##la ##f and cream ##ed green peas . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope i did n ' t spoil it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] yeah right . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , the lamb was n ' t grille ##d yet , it ' s still sitting in the marina ##de it ' ll take five minutes to cook and the rest of the stuff can be re ##hea ##ted no problem . [SEP]
[CLS] you just sit and i ' ll take care of everything , ' ' ` ` yes ma ' am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass , taking one for myself as i sat at the island and watched her fl ##it around my kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed , happy . [SEP]
[CLS] it was strange to look at this almost stranger and realize that already i ' d come to know her so well . [SEP]
[CLS] did she even realize that she ' d started signing ? [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t done that since she ' d been here . [SEP]
[CLS] i would ' ve thought that she spent every waking moment singing , but this was the first time since i ' d brought her home that i ' d heard her so much as hum . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t the song from the other night , this one was slow and dream ##y , with a catch ##y little lil ##t to it that made me want to strain to hear the words since she was singing so low . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sing louder princess i wan na hear you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned wide eyes to me and looked down at her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not really good at that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean i ' ve learned how to control my fear somewhat before i go out on stage , but i ca n ' t really sing in front of anyone just like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how do you do it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ' my manager gives me these pills . . . ' ' i did n ' t like the sounds of that one bit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what kind of pills ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i lowered my glass and looked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nothing bad , just something to calm my anxiety . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is there a prescription ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no nothing like that , i never even asked him where he gets them . . . ' ' ` ` do you have them with you now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at me quiz ##zic ##ally . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll just like to have a look at them that ' s all , make sure they ' re okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh i ' m sure they ' re fine doug would never do anything to hurt me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you have the pills back at your place ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , doug keeps them with him , he gives me one before each performance or sometimes when i have to go on one of those talk shows . [SEP]
[CLS] looks like i was go ##n na have to have a talk with her manager . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so f * * king green , i was sure it would never cross her mind to question anything the man did . [SEP]
[CLS] though i did n ' t know him personally , i ' m a businessman and i know all about the bottom line . [SEP]
[CLS] her voice is like liquid gold , i ' m sure dear old doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them money . [SEP]
[CLS] that was something else i was go ##n na have to look into as well . [SEP]
[CLS] when i ' d made the decision to own her , everything that she is became my responsibility . [SEP]
[CLS] there might be some friction because i ' ve noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak , but i had no intentions on letting that stop me . [SEP]
[CLS] though i ' d save it for another time , nothing was going to mar the night for us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` vo ##ila , dinner is ready . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she seemed nervous as she served me , and then herself . [SEP]
[CLS] i closed my eyes with the first taste of the su ##cc ##ulent lamb . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , where did you learn to cook like this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mom taught me and i love watching the cooking channel , you really like it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i took another bite and it was good as the first . [SEP]
[CLS] nodding my head i leaned over and peck ##ed her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s amazing princess , wow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i kept the conversation light over dinner , asking her more about life on tour and what she enjoyed most about her fame . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as i could tell she was more interested in the singing than anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , trace , you were n ' t serious about that o ##vu ##lating thing were you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d almost forgotten about that , still was n ' t quite sure what had possessed me to think of it much less say it . [SEP]
[CLS] but now that she ' d asked me outright . . . ` ` as a matter of fact i am . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s crazy i know , and if one of my colleagues had come to me with this story i would tell him he ' s crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] i have no explanation for it , the reality is that from the moment i saw you up on that stage something inside me shifted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i find myself rev ##ert ##ing back to childhood , to a time when i had to sc ##rou ##nge for every scrap i wanted or needed . [SEP]
[CLS] when i became successful , i promised myself that i ' d never go hungry again , and not just for food , but for any of those things i ' d longed for as a child , or anything my heart may desire as an adult . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the first thing my heart ' s ever desired . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve known wants before do n ' t get me wrong , but this , this is different . [SEP]
[CLS] this goes beyond my own comprehension . [SEP]
[CLS] like i told you before , this past weekend was about getting to know each other and i ' ve gotten to know you . [SEP]
[CLS] you would n ' t have come home with me had you not felt some of what i was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] i also know that you ' re more about hearth and home than the night life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t tell her that i knew that ' s why she ' d stayed with the ass * * le who ' d ended up cheating on her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d done some research after she was less than forthcoming about the reason for their split . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t a known fact as yet but i had my ways of finding out things . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t tell her that i knew though ; it was her story to tell if and when she was ready . [SEP]
[CLS] i did know that if i ever ran into the little prick , i was go ##n na beat the crap out of him for putting his hands on her though . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t matter that i did n ' t even know her when it happened , it ' s just the way i am , or at least it ' s the way i seem to be where she ' s concerned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but a baby ? [SEP]
[CLS] we hardly even know each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think that whatever is going on here has anything to do with time and convention . [SEP]
[CLS] either way , it ' s nothing to worry about now . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s done is done , and if it is n ' t , i ' m go ##n na make damn sure that it is . [SEP]
[CLS] the only problem is your upcoming tour , but i ' m sure people have performed while pregnant before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know how crazy this all sounds ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shrugged my shoulders at her . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought it was crazy too in the beginning so i could n ' t fault her for having her own doubts . [SEP]
[CLS] it was crazy when you looked at it , but it ' s what i felt and well . . . ` ` i ' m sure there have been people who got married after only one day of meeting or maybe two . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m even more sure that there are people who get pregnant after just one meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] look at this way ; at least we both know where we stand . [SEP]
[CLS] if the last few hours are anything to go by , we want each other more than a little bit and the bottom line is princess . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you , in my life , with me , no matter what . [SEP]
[CLS] so baby or no baby , you ' ve met your future , so i suggest you get used to the idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i had other plans ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like i said , i ' ve gotten to know you , and all that aside , this is what i want baby . [SEP]
[CLS] as time goes on you ' ll find that i never let anything stand in my way , nothing and no one . [SEP]
[CLS] dinner was delicious why do n ' t you go find us something to watch while i clean up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 6 shia ##ne i guess the conversation was over and what a strange one at that . [SEP]
[CLS] i headed out of the kitchen on wo ##bbly legs for the tv room to find something to watch , though i really did n ' t have much interest . [SEP]
[CLS] my mind was aw ##hir ##l with all the new things that were going on in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] in the space of a few short days , it seems my life had been turned upside down . [SEP]
[CLS] i find myself doing things that were totally outside the box for me . [SEP]
[CLS] but this latest was a lot to take in , though the thought of it made me hot . [SEP]
[CLS] trace was right . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve always only ever wanted to be a mother and a wife . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d thought i would have that life with donnie , but was it possible to have it with this man that i ' d only just met ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if he was just saying these things because like he ' d said , he ' d come to know me and knew that ' s just what i wanted to hear ? [SEP]
[CLS] how was it possible that he could want me like that after a chance meeting ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d spent some time today looking for any and everything i could find about him on the net . [SEP]
[CLS] the one thing that stood out except for his success as a businessman , was the fact that he had a different woman every couple of months . [SEP]
[CLS] had he used this same line on them ? [SEP]
[CLS] somehow , he did n ' t strike me as the type . [SEP]
[CLS] still , i had another worry . [SEP]
[CLS] the things he ' d made me feel . [SEP]
[CLS] how will i live without them if this was all just a game to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d made me feel things i never knew were in me . [SEP]
[CLS] my body has never reacted this way before , and even though his size was a little uncomfortable , the pain was more a pleasure - pain than a real hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt myself cream ##ing just thinking about it . [SEP]
[CLS] could a man really make love to a woman that much without some kind of feeling involved ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if it was just lust ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d seen pictures of some of the women he ' d dated in the past and i have to say some of them were drop dead gorgeous , including the last one he ' d been seen with a couple weeks ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the though caused me a moment ' s doubt and i thought if ways to shield my heart this time , but i was afraid i might be too late . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d taken me over completely , something i had no experience with . [SEP]
[CLS] i had n ' t the faint ##est idea how to handle a man like trace mckenzie . [SEP]
[CLS] he was way out of my league . [SEP]
[CLS] i heard him coming and searched through the stack of movies he had for something to watch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me from behind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what makes you think something ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i looked over my shoulder at him trying to put a brave face on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t sure when i first came in but now i ' m certain it ' s all over your face . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled me towards the couch and down on his lap with his arms holding me close . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason i wanted to cry ; he ' s been so kind and at ##ten ##tive in the time that we ' d been together , what if it were all a far ##ce ? [SEP]
[CLS] i had no idea that i ' d started to cry until i felt his fingers wiping my cheeks dry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what ' s bothering you sweetheart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i could only shake my head and cry harder as i buried my face in his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t play games with me trace , i ca n ' t stand it if you ' re just using me for some sick game . . . ' ' i broke off when he lifted my face to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` baby ! [SEP]
[CLS] i forgot you do n ' t know that much about men , only that boy you were messing around with . [SEP]
[CLS] let me show you something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and took my hand in his , leading me out of the room and into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] standing me in front of the floor - length standing mirror , he removed my robe , dropping it to the floor , as i stood before him naked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you see those marks all over your neck and tits ? [SEP]
[CLS] do you know what those are called ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi ##ckey ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s one word for it , they ' re also known as passion marks . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never given one to a woman before . [SEP]
[CLS] not since i learned what they meant as a young man . [SEP]
[CLS] they may mean different things to different people . [SEP]
[CLS] to me , they are a mark of ownership . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s my mark on you . [SEP]
[CLS] i put it there as a statement to you and anyone else who might see them , the ones on your neck anyway , anyone else sees the others , i ' ll heat up your little ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hand dropped to one in particular spot that was right at the tip of my pu * * y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` another thing , i do n ' t think a man that ' s not really interested in a woman can f * * k her five times if he did n ' t really mean it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` five ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i started counting on my fingers and got to four before i was being cart ##ed off to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i looked up into his eyes as he laid me back and spread my legs before dropping his robe . [SEP]
[CLS] his c * * k was hard and red , with a string of pr * * cum hanging from the end heading for the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] trace i knew she had to be sore , but she also seemed to need reassuring and for now this was the best i could do . [SEP]
[CLS] only time will convince her that this was the real deal . [SEP]
[CLS] fuck i was just as confused as she was , but unlike her , i was n ' t about to let doubts get in the way of what i wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] taking her sore ##ness into consideration , i dropped to my knees between her spread thighs and opened her pu * * y lips gently with my fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a little red and puff ##y from too much f * * king , but she was also getting wet . [SEP]
[CLS] i licked her clit with the tip of my tongue , staying away from her pu * * y slit for now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##oh . . . ' ' i love how f * * king responsive she is , the way she lights up as soon as i put my hands on her . [SEP]
[CLS] i licked and sucked her clit until her juice ##s started coming fast and furious . [SEP]
[CLS] then i dipped my tongue into her pu * * y , going slow so i could soothe the ache in her over ##used cu ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] she gripped my hair and mas ##hed her pu * * y into my mouth before she filled my mouth with pu * * y juice . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came down from her climax i helped her up from the bed and folding her in my arms kissed her long and deep , sharing her taste with her . [SEP]
[CLS] we tongue f * * ked each others ' mouths like starving wolves and my c * * k was poking into her nave ##l as she rubbed herself against me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` suck me off baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she slid down to her knees and studied my c * * k before sticking out her tongue and licking the pr * * cum from my cock ##head . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s an enigma , all shy and blushing one minute and my little vi ##x ##en the next . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a moment of jealousy at the thought that she ' d done this with that ass * * le but let it go for now . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a very territorial f * * ke ##r , i knew i had to live with the fact that he ' d had her but i needed to erase him from her memory . [SEP]
[CLS] she licked along my shaft before sucking the fat head of my c * * k into her mouth and sliding her mouth down my length until she ' d taken me in as deeply as she could . [SEP]
[CLS] i fisted her hair and waited until i was in her throat before i started thrusting in and out of her mouth , going slow at first , until i picked up the pace . [SEP]
[CLS] pretty soon i was face f * * king her and she was moaning around me cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i looked down past her eyes that were staring up at me and saw that she had her fingers stuffed in her pu * * y . i almost shot my load then and there . [SEP]
[CLS] she did some kinda muscle spa ##sm around my c * * k and my toes curled . [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled back so that i was no longer in her throat but on her tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t warn her that i was about to cum , why would i ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was going to swallow unless i said otherwise , and the only time i ' ll do that is when i was in the mood to paint her face , her tits or the small of her back . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost gag ##ged on the first volley . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` easy , breathe princess . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she soon got the hang of it and was swallowing fast enough in time to catch the next load . [SEP]
[CLS] when my balls were empty and my knees were almost too weak to stand i helped her to her feet and took her to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` forget the movie baby , you need me to hold you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laid down behind her with her much tin ##ier frame completely covered by my arms and legs , coco ##oning her as i whispered in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything ' s going to be okay princess , i promise . [SEP]
[CLS] if you ' ve learned anything about me so far , you should know i ' m not a man that plays games . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' ve had girlfriends before ; did you feel the same way with them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her voice had gone all soft there at the end and i felt her body tense as if expecting a blow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me ask you this ; do you feel the same with me as you did with him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] now it was my turn to tense up as i awaited her answer . [SEP]
[CLS] when it came , it went a long way of easing the green - eyed beast that had been trying its best to rear its ugly head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' ve never . . . but it ' s not the same . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve had so much more experience and i ' m sure i do n ' t measure up to some of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s where you ' re wrong sweetheart , first of all none of them ever came close and besides its about more than the physical . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes in life you find that one being that you ca n ' t live without , you may have sampled a lot along the way , but when you found the one , it ' s a whole new ball ##game . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me , what did you feel that night when our eyes meet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned around in my arms and looked up into my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was like being struck by lightning , or at least what i imagine that would feel like . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt a jolt to my system and i think i forgot how to breathe for a minute . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost panicked because for a split second i forgot the words to the song . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there you see ? [SEP]
[CLS] have you ever felt that before with anyone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head and bit her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] i could see the soft sheen of tears in her eyes and pulled her close to kiss her forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was pretty much the same with me baby ; so the next time you start doubt ##ing what we have , just remember those few minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] now go to sleep , you ' ve had a long day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i turned her back around intending to go to sleep , but by now my c * * k was raging again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lift your leg baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she lifted her top leg and i scooted down far enough to line up my c * * k with her pu * * y . i slid in and held still pulling her back firmly against my front . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not going to f * * k you again tonight , we ' ll just stay like this until you fall asleep , you need your man to stay inside you to keep the doubts away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i was suddenly very tired , and it was n ' t long before i fell asleep to the sound of her breathing evenly in sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] in the morning , i awakened to her pushing her ass back against me with my c * * k still lodged inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] with my hand on her hip , i controlled the pace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you take me hard or do you need me to go slow baby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ni ##pped her ear as she flooded my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` harder , please harder . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please what harder ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t answer so i reached around and pinched her nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me or i ' ll stop . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i held still and she tried to f * * k herself on my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled back as if i was going to leave her body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ##oo ##o , please , harder . . . fuck me harder . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] fuck , i think that shit back ##fire ##d on my ass , because her sweet voice saying those words triggered something inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning up on my elbow i reached my hand around and fingered her clit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` put your arm behind my neck . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she complied with my order and i bent my head to her nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] she screamed and went off like a rocket from the dual pleasure , or was it triple ? [SEP]
[CLS] i f * * ked into her hard as i played with her clit and sucked her nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] i imagined my son or daughter nursing at her bo ##unt ##iful tits some day soon and the next time her pu * * y clenched around me , i shot off inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was harder than i imagined it would be to leave her the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 7 for the next three weeks , we stayed hidden away in our lover ' s paradise . [SEP]
[CLS] each day , i went off to work and left her home . [SEP]
[CLS] and each night , i came home and after dinner , f * * ked her into the wee hours of the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was time for her to go back to work , i thought i would lose my f * * king mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to share her with anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew it was selfish ; she had a life , a career that she loved . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to move in here with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t seem too certain , still fighting those doubts i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scratch that , i ' ll send a service over to help you pack up , but when i get home this evening your little ass better be here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i left before she could give me an argument . [SEP]
[CLS] i was pissed off the whole day and did n ' t know why . [SEP]
[CLS] in the last three weeks , i could pick up the phone and call her whenever i wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] now she was busy doing her thing . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t like it one f * * king bit . [SEP]
[CLS] when had i become this person ? [SEP]
[CLS] i knew that what i felt for this girl was more than i ' d ever felt before , but still , this over ##powering need to possess her completely , to dominate her life , was new to me . [SEP]
[CLS] her upcoming show was out of town and i would n ' t be able to make it because of the timing . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to be without her for two weeks while she travelled outside the country for a eight night show . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been going to the studio to re ##hear ##se the last couple of days coming onto the end of our time together , but she ' d been there in the evenings . [SEP]
[CLS] she never said what if anything her handler ##s had said about the arrangement , but that could be because i ' d let her know one day when she tried to bro ##ach the subject that i really did n ' t give a f * * k . i heard her as soon as i cleared the door that evening . [SEP]
[CLS] good , that meant i did n ' t have to hunt her down and drag her ass back home . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d half expected her to di ##so ##bey my order to be here when i got home . [SEP]
[CLS] there were boxes in the living room and i breathed a little easier . [SEP]
[CLS] looks like i was getting my way after all . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was in the kitchen when i walked up on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t heard me because she had ear ##phones on . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling them out , she looked up at me with her little shy smile . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew she was fr ##etti ##ng again about where we were going . [SEP]
[CLS] i imagine moving in here with me was a big step for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never lived with a man before , and i had to keep reminding myself that she was young yet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did everything go okay with the move today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i still have some stuff to bring over and some will have to go into storage . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did they give you any trouble with the lease ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh about that . . . i ' m not sure that i wan na give up the place just yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i just looked at her not saying anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i asked you to move in here , did you think i meant for a few weeks or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do n ' t know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take care of the lease shia ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] or i will . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t forget , i ' m a businessman . [SEP]
[CLS] it makes no sense whatsoever for you to keep that place and pay the ex ##or ##bit ##ant rent for an empty apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] i understand that you still have doubts and fears , but i ' m not about to let them get in the way of things . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve spent the last three weeks trying to show you , but apparently that was n ' t enough so you ' re just go ##n na have to decide if you want to take a chance at happiness or not . [SEP]
[CLS] a word to the wise : i wo n ' t pay for someone else ' s short - coming ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] so if that ' s what this is about , you can kill that shit right f * * king now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed like we were about to have our first real argument there for a minute , but then she backed down . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed me to take charge and i had no problem with that . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d gone from under her parents ' care , straight to this manager ' s handling , so basically , she ' s been told what to do her whole life . [SEP]
[CLS] some people rebel against that , but with shia ##ne , it was quite the opposite . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed it . [SEP]
[CLS] she left two days later for europe and i spent the time gathering as much information as i could on her manager and the other people around her . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t like that pill deal she ' d told me about , and from some of the things she ' d said , i was n ' t too sure that her best interest was being taken care of . [SEP]
[CLS] as her man , it was up to me to see that no one was taking advantage of her . [SEP]
[CLS] and though our relationship had been spared the spotlight thus far , it was only a matter of time before word leaked out . [SEP]
[CLS] and how would it look for wall street ' s w ##hi ##z kid to be letting others take advantage of his woman ? [SEP]
[CLS] we talked every night after her show no matter what time it was , that was a st ##ip ##ulation that i ' d made before she left . [SEP]
[CLS] she could get away during the day because i knew she was busy with rehearsals , but at night i needed to know that she was safe . [SEP]
[CLS] we did face ##time until she fell asleep ; each night , i could see that my baby was exhausted but she seemed to be having fun . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a lot of buzz in the headlines about her shows but i did n ' t listen or read any of it . [SEP]
[CLS] that was until two days before she was due back . [SEP]
[CLS] my assistant was reading one of those crap ##py magazines that were filled with half - truths and inn ##uen ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s how i ' d always seen them until i saw my woman walking out of some restaurant in italy with her ex . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to fly off the handle ; the capt ##ion said the picture had been snapped the night before which had to mean it was before we ' d spoken and she had n ' t mentioned it to me . [SEP]
[CLS] my first instinct was to get on a plane and got drag her ass home after dealing with both of them , but common sense and rational ##ity won out . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t go half way around the world to kill her . [SEP]
[CLS] no , i ' ll wait ' til she gets back and st ##rangle her ass in the privacy of our own home . [SEP]
[CLS] that night when she called , she still did n ' t mention it and i played like nothing was wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something in her voice but i was n ' t quite sure what it was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ve got your final show tomorrow night yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , and then i ' ll be home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be waiting . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the next night when she called , i did n ' t answer . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d spent the whole day in a contained rage and had pretty much locked myself away in my office . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d come to terms with the fact that i did n ' t believe for a second that she ' d cheated on me , but whatever reason she had for being with him was not good enough . [SEP]
[CLS] and the fact that she had n ' t mentioned it to me , only in ##fur ##iated me more . [SEP]
[CLS] she was home when i got in the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] when she ran to me and jumped into my arms i held her close but did n ' t kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew something was wrong and her eyes followed me across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is something wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is there something you want to tell me shia ##ne ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at me at sea . [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled out the magazine i ' d had hidden in the drawer of the little side table and threw it at her . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened when she saw it and she looked up at me with fear in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not what it looks like . [SEP]
[CLS] i can explain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i walked away from her and into the bedroom to remove my jacket and tie where she followed me a few seconds later . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace . . . ' ' ` ` were you the one that was afraid of me cheating on you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never seen me this way before , so she had no way of knowing that the precise movements and contained tone was a sure sign that her ass was in trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i did n ' t cheat , he was on tour because we have a few duets together and . . . ' ' ` ` and you did n ' t tell me this because . . . ' ' ` ` i did n ' t want to cause any problems . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked down at the floor and run ##g her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and the restaurant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everyone was there that night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you talk to him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . ' ' i saw the answer in the guilty look in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take off your clothes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she jumped and reached for the buttons on her shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i was naked by now and walked around to my closet . [SEP]
[CLS] i came back out with my leather strap and she took one look at it and tried to make a run for it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t really want to make this any worst than it already is do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that stopped her in her tracks but she was still halfway out of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come here . . . do n ' t make me have to tell you again shia ##ne . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i almost cave ##d when she turned big tear filled eyes my way . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath to fort ##ify herself and then walked slowly towards me with her head down . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t turn her over my knee . [SEP]
[CLS] i was too angry for that . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , i brought the belt down across her ass and thighs as she hopped from foot to foot pleading with me to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please trace nothing happened . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to hear it , you had your chance to tell me this shit before you left here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gave her a good twenty hard blows with the belt until she was a crying sl ##ob ##ber ##ing mess . [SEP]
[CLS] still not satisfied i left her there crying and walked out of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i went for a long drive to cool down but by the time i got back , i was still no better than when i left . [SEP]
[CLS] she was in the middle of our bed with her arm locked around her bent knees rocking back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] we looked at each other but i still was n ' t ready to talk to her . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt betrayed ; it was a new feeling for me . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a long time since anyone had had the guts to cross me . [SEP]
[CLS] i headed into the shower in the hopes that the water would help to soothe my ragged nerves but no luck . [SEP]
[CLS] she was wearing my old tee shirt , which she ' d taken with her when she ' d left . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lose the shirt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hurried to comply though i noticed her eyes fell to my hands to make sure she was n ' t about to get another whipping . [SEP]
[CLS] i climbed onto the bed and turned her around roughly . [SEP]
[CLS] in the three weeks we ' d bee together , as hard as i ' d been f * * king her , i ' d always held something back , but not tonight , tonight i was going to give her the f * * king i ' ve been dying to but did n ' t because her little pu * * y was still having trouble taking my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t take the time to prepare her , this was a punishment after all , i planned to use her body tonight for my own pleasure until i ' d freed myself of this burning rage . [SEP]
[CLS] i had her bent over in the middle of the bed , her legs spread , head down and her pu * * y in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] licking my fingers i ran them roughly over her pu * * y , dipping my middle finger into her wet heat before st ##rad ##dling her from behind . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t knee behind her , that would n ' t achieve my aim . [SEP]
[CLS] i stood with my legs on either side of hers , slightly bent . [SEP]
[CLS] from this angle i could drill down into her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure it would be a little harder for her to take me in this position but i really could give a f * * k at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] i ran my c * * k ring up and down her slit until she started to get wet , then i slammed into her only giving her about half my length . [SEP]
[CLS] she screamed into the mattress and her body shook but i did n ' t stop pounding until i was balls deep in her up ##turn ##ed pu * * y . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing a fist ##ful of her hair , i pulled her head back until i could see down into her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i saw pain , but there was lust there as well as i battered her pu * * y with my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] when i felt her clenching , i pulled out and left her panting . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked over her shoulder at me but she did n ' t have the nerve to say anything to me . [SEP]
[CLS] when i was sure she was n ' t about to cum , i screwed my c * * k back into her , pulling her ass up higher to keep her at the angle i wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept pulling out to tease her with the piercing in the end of my c * * k because i knew how much she loved that , but not giving her enough to get her off . [SEP]
[CLS] the hoarse cries told me that i was hurting her , even as her pu * * y got wet ##ter and wet ##ter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please trace . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not another f * * king word . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tugged on her hair for emphasis and she bit her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t hide the f * * k me noises that seemed to come from her gut , and her pu * * y was on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] i love those noises she made as i f * * ked into her my c * * k ring was hitting her just right and she started pushing back trying to get more of my twelve inches inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] as pissed as i was i held off though , because i knew her tight little pu * * y could n ' t handle too much in this position , not so soon , it was going to take lots of f * * king before that could happen without me tearing her . [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled out and licked into her pu * * y , going deep , she screamed and came in my mouth before i climbed back onto my feet and fed her eight inches of my meat . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s as deep as i could go before bottom ##ing out inside her with her ass high in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as soon as i ' ve broken in your tight little pu * * y , i ' m going to ass f * * k you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she clenched around me and came again . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t anywhere near cum ##ming so i settled in for a nice long f * * k . her body was still shaking and her cries were dying down to low moans . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried getting her hand under her to touch her sore pu * * y but a hard smack on her ass stopped her in her tracks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] finally , i lowered her ass just a little and dropped to my knees behind her and the movement sent me all the way into her . [SEP]
[CLS] it triggered another one of her magnificent climax ##es and she squeezed my c * * k like a vis ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] i bit into the flesh of her back to her neck before pulling her head back and to the side for my tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you trace . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that stopped me mid stroke , the shock of it , but that did n ' t last too long . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you too , but this is n ' t about that . [SEP]
[CLS] you f * * ked up . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m pissed as f * * k at you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i brought her off three more times until i felt my balls draw up to my body in preparation to blast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t deserve my seed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled out and pushed her away from me . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned around in time to watch me jerk my seed into the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] her cry of dismay cut through the air as i climbed off the bed and headed to the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] i was only in there two minutes when i felt her come in and stand in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my head back and eyes closed as i ran the cloth over my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace , i ' m so sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t do it again . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was crying as her hands came up to touch me tentatively . [SEP]
[CLS] i finished my shower without saying a word to her and walked away . [SEP]
[CLS] i stripped the bed after drying myself off and putting on a pair of boxers . [SEP]
[CLS] she was coming out of the shower by the time i was finished re ##making the bed she looked at me as i passed her and left the room . [SEP]
[CLS] in the kitchen , i ignored the dinner she ' d made and made myself a sandwich before shutting myself away in my private office . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hours before i felt human again . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d called the detail i ' d had following her un ##bek ##now ##nst to her and got the same story from them . [SEP]
[CLS] that eased my anger some but there was still the issue of why she did n ' t tell me that her ex was going to be on this trip . [SEP]
[CLS] from what they ' d said , he ' d been hound ##ing her the whole time she was there but she ' d seemed di ##sin ##ter ##ested . [SEP]
[CLS] like i said , i never thought she ' d cheated on me with him ; i still did n ' t want her having anything at all to do with him . [SEP]
[CLS] along with that , the reports on her manager were n ' t looking too good . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just as i ' d suspected , he was using the young girl for his own gains . [SEP]
[CLS] she had been robbed of a good three million dollars in the two years she ' d been signed . [SEP]
[CLS] money from different venues that i ' m sure she was n ' t even aware of . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t hurting for money , not by a long shot , but still it was n ' t for him or anyone else to rip her off . [SEP]
[CLS] before i confronted him though , i was still waiting for the results of the in depth investigation of everyone that had anything to do with her career . [SEP]
[CLS] she was curled into a ball on my side of the bed when i finally upstairs hours later . [SEP]
[CLS] i stood over her for the longest time until i felt my heart settle . [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t have chosen a moment of anger in which to tell her that i loved her , but she ' d chosen the time and place . [SEP]
[CLS] now it was out there , i ' d shown her my heart , as well as giving it to her . [SEP]
[CLS] we could never go back now , from here on out we were one and for me that meant a whole lot of shit . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d only gotten a taste of the man tonight , if she f * * ked up in the future it could be worst . [SEP]
[CLS] turning away , i walked to my side and climbed in with my back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she must ' ve gr ##avi ##tated to me in her sleep , because i woke before the sun the next day to find her curled into my back . [SEP]
[CLS] lifting my arm , i turned and pulled her into my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she was barely awake when i turned her to her back and slipped into her wet heat . [SEP]
[CLS] she clutched at me in her sleep before she came fully awake . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace . . . ' ' her voice was that of a little girl lost . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sh ##h , it ' s okay i ' m here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pushed her hair back so i could look into her eyes as i stroked my c * * k in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wrap your legs around me princess . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she lifted her legs around my waist pulling me in deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] i never took my eyes off of hers ; i wanted to see what was there , what words could never say because there were n ' t enough . [SEP]
[CLS] when i came i captured her lips with mine and accepted her moans into my lungs as she gave me her sweet nectar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tightened around me and cried out at my admission . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 8 things settled down somewhat after that and we lived a life of peaceful bliss for the next month and a half . [SEP]
[CLS] i took her away on my jet for long weekends . [SEP]
[CLS] we played , we laughed we enjoyed each other and the more time went by , the more in love with her i became . [SEP]
[CLS] i no longer questioned the strange ##ness of our meeting , or why it had been so easy for me to make the decisions i had after so many years of living and thinking one way . [SEP]
[CLS] she was my beautiful girl , the owner of my heart . [SEP]
[CLS] her career was doing extremely well , her records were going platinum all over the place and she was in high demand . [SEP]
[CLS] she had another local show coming up this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] this time i was ready when she approached my hesitantly to let me know that her ex was going to be performing at the show . [SEP]
[CLS] i had had time to prepare myself since i ' d already gotten a line - up of what was in store for that night . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been following her career since the day we met and now i have all the information i needed to send her manager and a couple lawyers to jail . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t told her what i ' d found as yet . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t want to upset her this close to her performance and i ' d only just got the last of the result . [SEP]
[CLS] it had taken this long because the lawyers had been very slick with their th ##ie ##very . [SEP]
[CLS] too bad for them i know how to follow the money trail , all i need is the scent . [SEP]
[CLS] i planned to tell her this weekend after the show though and i already had my lawyers on stand ##by to take care of shit . [SEP]
[CLS] shia ##ne trace has been so un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly amazing in the last month or so . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like everyday he goes out of his way to relieve my fears . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it ' s because we were able to keep our romance out of the public eye , but i was having more fun being in love with him than i ' d ever thought possible . [SEP]
[CLS] i decided to take a page out of his book and try to really get to know him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d watch him when he was n ' t looking , and paid attention to the little things , like how he shielded my body with his whenever we were going somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] how he always seemed to have to touch me whenever we were together no matter where we were ; or the way he ' d run his hand through my hair absent ##mind ##edly while we sat together watching a movie . [SEP]
[CLS] i especially loved the way he made love to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ever since that night when he ' d punished me , which now when i think back on it was hot as hell ; he ' s been this super boyfriend though it seems kinda weird thinking of him in that way , he ' s so much more than a boy . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d told my family about him and dad and him had had a few private conversations over the last few weeks that i was n ' t privy to , but my family seemed to love and accept him even with the age difference . [SEP]
[CLS] now i have a show coming up tonight and i ' m more nervous than usual . [SEP]
[CLS] not because of the show itself , no , trace had taken care of that as el ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d found this lady that specialized in cu ##ring people like me . [SEP]
[CLS] she just put me through this series of exercises that helped to calm me down before each appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an ongoing process but so far it seemed to be working . [SEP]
[CLS] i no longer had that sick fear of bombing on stage . [SEP]
[CLS] no tonight ' s fear stemmed from the fact that donnie was there and i knew form our last one sided conversation that he was going to try to get back with me again . [SEP]
[CLS] because trace and i had been able to keep our relationship hidden , he along most of the known world were under the impression that i was still pin ##ing for him . [SEP]
[CLS] then there were the rumors of us sneaking around together . [SEP]
[CLS] one tabloid had gone so far as to print that very suggestion . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought trace would lose his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d gone on a tear even going so far as to call up someone to handle the re ##tra ##ction and fire the person responsible . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess it was n ' t just the speculation that had sent him over the edge , but the fact that there was a photo shop ##ped picture from the year before of me and donnie , only this one was made to look like it was more recent and well , let ' s just say it did n ' t sit well with trace to see his woman as he put it , lip locked with some other dick . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently whatever he ' d done had worked because the following week there had been a re ##tra ##ction and an apology . [SEP]
[CLS] will wonders never cease ? [SEP]
[CLS] of course now we were down to crunch time . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d said that he was fine with the whole show deal but as the time drew nearer i could see that ti ##c in his jaw working overtime . [SEP]
[CLS] all i could do was hope for the best . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shia ##ne baby come in here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] trace her show was in a couple hours and she ' d have to leave soon for prep . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d made peace with the fact that she was going to be sharing the stage with the ass * * le ex for part of tonight ' s show . [SEP]
[CLS] although i ' d told her that i was fine , the truth is that i ' m not the kind of man who could ever be okay with such a thing , but the contracts had been signed long before i came on the scene and it was her career . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to make sure that this was the last time though . [SEP]
[CLS] after this series of engagements were over , there will never be another occasion when she would be allowed even in the same room as the prick . [SEP]
[CLS] she came into room already dressed to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t say anything to her as i pulled her into my arms and fed her my tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] my hand went down to her pu * * y and she opened her legs to give me easier access . [SEP]
[CLS] i rubbed her through her clothes as her breathing sped up and she smashed her tits into my naked chest . [SEP]
[CLS] word ##lessly i started to strip her clothes away as my c * * k grew and pr * * cum started leaking from my tip . [SEP]
[CLS] i had her spread out on the bed with my head between her thighs as i ate her pu * * y , making sure to sink my tongue as deep as i could as i fingered her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] over the past weeks i ' ve been preparing her ass for my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] she moaned and pushed her pu * * y harder against my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] her juice ##s ran down to the crack of her ass lu ##bri ##cating her nicely . [SEP]
[CLS] standing from between her legs where her pink pu * * y was on full display with her juice ##s glistening and calling to me , i helped her onto her hands and knees in the middle of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i teased her pu * * y slit with my c * * k head until pushed her ass up higher and begged me to f * * k her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please trace . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i slapped her ass once hard and she looked over her shoulder at me . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were already glazed over and i knew she was already far - gone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck me , f * * k my pu * * y hard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] yes , that ' s something else i ' d taught her , to be less inhibit ##ed in bed . [SEP]
[CLS] at first her shy ##ness ruled her , but i soon had her saying and doing anything she loved . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d explained to her that since i was the only sexual partner she ' d ever have for the rest of her life , who better to know what pleased her ? [SEP]
[CLS] and how will i know if she did n ' t tell me ? [SEP]
[CLS] that had opened up a whole new world to her , and i ' d learned a lot about my princess . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a bit of the sub ##missive in her , she liked for her man to take charge , not just in the bedroom either . [SEP]
[CLS] it was perfect since i ' m a controlling bastard and make no bones about it . [SEP]
[CLS] i teased her pu * * y some more before sinking my c * * k all the way home . [SEP]
[CLS] she arched her back and came like she always does as soon as i enter her . [SEP]
[CLS] she says it ' s because i hit her ce ##r ##vi ##x each time and it triggers her . [SEP]
[CLS] i f * * ked into her nice and slow , using my hand in her hair and the other on her hip to control her movements . [SEP]
[CLS] looking down between us i enjoyed the sight of my c * * k covered in her pu * * y cream as it went in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your pu * * y ' s still so tight baby , f * * k . ' ' she lowered her head to the mattress which sent her ass even higher into the air and had my c * * k going in deeper and at a different angle . [SEP]
[CLS] getting to my feet , i released her hair so i could hold both her hips and pull her back hard on my c * * k as her pu * * y opened and closed around my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i could see where my c * * k was bulging out around the lips of her pu * * y , the way they pulled out when i came out and folded in when i f * * ked back in . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew she still could n ' t too much of a pounding in this position so it was slow going until she juice ##d all over my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to cum in her pu * * y just yet though i had other plans for tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling out after she ' d come down , i licked her pu * * y deep while using my fingers to rub our mixed juice ##s into her tight ass * * le . [SEP]
[CLS] she flinched and moaned as she pushed back against my fingers trying to get me to go deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] i probably should ' ve used a little sex toy on her ass to prepare her for my twelve inch cock , but i did n ' t want even a fake dick anywhere near her . [SEP]
[CLS] reaching off to the side i got the lu ##be and oil ##ed up my cock . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked over her shoulder to see what i was doing and her eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sh ##h , it ' s okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ran my hands up and down her back around to her tits where i pulled and pinched them the way she likes . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept letting my c * * k tap into her pu * * y lips and her clit , which kept her preoccupied . [SEP]
[CLS] when i was sure she was ready , i leaned over her back , then i had a thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did he f * * k you in the ass ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i had wrapped my hand around her throat un ##k ##now ##ingly , it was only when she shook her head no that i realized what i ' d done . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t think she ' d ever anal before but i wanted to be sure , it was the reason i ' d chosen tonight after all . [SEP]
[CLS] satisfied with her answer , i guided my c * * k as gently as i could to her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] she was tight as was to be expected so i had to take me time and work my c * * k into her ass in one - inch inc ##rem ##ents . [SEP]
[CLS] she tensed and her body tried to ex ##pel me but i soothe ##d her with soft kisses around her ear and down her neck , whispering how beautiful she was and how much i loved her . [SEP]
[CLS] her ass relaxed enough for me to get a few inches in her and then i started the f * * king motion in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not really big on anal sex , but it was enjoyable on some occasions . [SEP]
[CLS] the more she relaxed , the more dick i fed her until i was balls deep in her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] she was really getting into it now pushing her ass back hard against me until i was lying flat on her back pressing her into the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] her ass was the tight ##est f * * king thing i ' d ever felt around my cock , and that was saying something because my baby has a tight cu ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you ' re on stage with him , i want you to remember who you belong to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i slammed into her ass and her mouth opened in a sound ##less scream . [SEP]
[CLS] i f * * ked her to two orgasm ##s but i myself did n ' t want to cum in her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] instead i pulled out and with a stern ' stay as you are ' , went into the bathroom to clean off my rock hard cock . [SEP]
[CLS] coming back to the bed , i rolled her over onto her back and climbed between her legs pushing them farther apart with my hips . [SEP]
[CLS] i looked down at what i was doing as i led my c * * k into her pu * * y again . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t hurry ; i knew i was f * * king with her because she should ' ve been gone half an hour ago . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t care ; this was my way of showing her who was in charge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace , we have to hurry i have to . . . ' ' i caught her neck in my hand and surged into her hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t rush me , we ' re through when i say we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i kissed her then , sending my tongue deep into her as i f * * ked her nice and slow making her forget that she was way late . [SEP]
[CLS] she f * * ked back at me her hips going wild as i kept teasing her with small strokes instead of the pounding she needed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if he touches you , i ' ll kill him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked into my eyes before hers rolled back in her head and she came . [SEP]
[CLS] it was soon too much for me and though i did n ' t pound away at her like i always want to , i f * * ked her to another climax as my balls un ##loaded in her womb . [SEP]
[CLS] i bit into her neck just as the last of my sperm was spilling into her . [SEP]
[CLS] i smirked down at my handy work . [SEP]
[CLS] let the little f * * k think about that . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 9 she sat practically in my lap in the car on the way to the venue . [SEP]
[CLS] her manager was not pleased to say the least and started in screaming until i told him to get f * * ked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who are you ? [SEP]
[CLS] hey are n ' t you . . . ' ' i did n ' t bother to answer the f * * ke ##r as he stared from me to her and back . [SEP]
[CLS] she headed off to do her thing and i walked away from him , i was n ' t ready to deal with him right now . [SEP]
[CLS] i stood around backstage until it was almost time for the show to begin then went out and took my seat in the front row . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d debated on whether or not this was a good idea , watching her perform with him , but in the end she ' d pleaded with me to come . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess it was best if i were here in the flesh to see what the hell the performance was like than reading about it second hand in some rag . [SEP]
[CLS] the buzz was that they were d ##y * * * it ##e on the stage , that they had great chemistry and all that other bullshit . [SEP]
[CLS] i settled in for a long night . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt a huge sense of pride when she came out the first time and the crowd went wild . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a much larger crowd than the one from the night we met and the whole place was on their feet . [SEP]
[CLS] you would never know that less than two hours ago i had her bent over . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t look at all nervous and in fact seemed to be glowing . [SEP]
[CLS] it was halfway through , when i ' d finally felt the tension leave me and had relaxed and start to enjoy the show that he joined her on stage . [SEP]
[CLS] the song was one of those dual tone numbers , slow in parts and fast in others . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt my fist fold the first time he had to get real close to her as they faced each other across the microphone ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] then ensued a sort of cat and mouse dance . [SEP]
[CLS] he kept trying to put his arms around her waist or on her hip . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t sure if that was part of the actual dance routine or just him being an ass , but the first time she threw a panicked look my way i knew it was a bit of both . [SEP]
[CLS] the crowd seemed to read something else into it , as it appeared that she was playing hard to get , eva ##ding his ro ##ving hands and pr ##an ##cing away as she continued singing , only to be followed by him time and again . [SEP]
[CLS] each time our eyes met i kept my face neutral , i did n ' t want to spoil her performance and like i said if this was part of her job then so be it . [SEP]
[CLS] but what i did n ' t like was the way he tried to man ##hand ##le her on the stage when it had nothing to do with their routine . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t ask me how i knew those times so well . [SEP]
[CLS] i was reading her body language sure , but each time it happened she ' d send me a look and it would tip me off . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t mad at her though , not really , but him i ' d like to st ##omp into the f * * king mud . [SEP]
[CLS] i left my seat and headed backstage just before the last number ended . [SEP]
[CLS] i cold hear the roar of the crowd as she bid them goodnight for the second time after giving them the encore they ' d asked for . [SEP]
[CLS] i was in the shadows sort of , behind this huge pot ##ted plant , when she came back followed by the rest of the band , and the ass * * le . ` ` [SEP]
[CLS] hey i ' m talking to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out to grab her arm and she pulled it out of his reach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the show is over donnie we have nothing more to say to each other for the rest of the night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what you think . [SEP]
[CLS] where did you get this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tried touching the mark i ' d left on her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] she slapped her hand over it and backed up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s none of your business . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is my business when my woman is sporting a hi ##ckey from some other dude . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your woman , are you insane ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve been over for months now would you please get out of my way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried going around him and by this point i ' d seen all i needed to . [SEP]
[CLS] i started forward but before i could reach them he ' d reached out and grabbed her and was trying to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] the amazing this was that there were others heading backstage and no one seemed to witness the almost assault that was taking place right in front of them . [SEP]
[CLS] that could be because their voices had been kept low throughout this whole exchange . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as his hand fisted in her blouse i was on him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get the f * * k off her ass * * le . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i flung his hand away and got between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] you could say i was pissed but trying to contain it . [SEP]
[CLS] i was no longer angry about the display on stage , i knew that was all him and though the world might see a very well coordinated dance routine , that ' s all that it was . [SEP]
[CLS] but this was something more , this was personal and this i would not allow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who the f * * k are you , shia ##ne who ' s this ass * * le ? [SEP]
[CLS] is he new security ? [SEP]
[CLS] tell him who i am before i sue his ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` listen you little shit , if you come anywhere near her again i ' ll break every bone in your f * * king body . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her wide eyed when he realized i meant every word . [SEP]
[CLS] then he stupid ##ly reached out for her again , grabbing her hand this time and i saw red . [SEP]
[CLS] i punched him in the face until blood spur ##ted from his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] only the fact that he was so much younger than i , kept me from following through . [SEP]
[CLS] i grabbed her hand and pulled her out behind me mad as hell . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t have a jacket to give her this time but thankfully she was more covered up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you leave anything back there that you needed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i asked her after we were in the back of the car on the way home . [SEP]
[CLS] she called one of her assistants to gather her shit . [SEP]
[CLS] that night i f * * ked her like a beast , there was n ' t any part of her body that i did n ' t lick bite or kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] at one point she ' d cried because it was too much . [SEP]
[CLS] i ate her little pu * * y until the sting was eased and then slid back into her . [SEP]
[CLS] we were both sore by the time i rolled away from her as the sun was rising . [SEP]
[CLS] dragging her into my arms i cu ##ddled her as we slept . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day i was all over the f * * king front page , just what i needed . [SEP]
[CLS] some hack had been there taking pictures of the whole thing and the story broke . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s how we were found out and since that night we could n ' t leave the house for weeks without a camera in our face . [SEP]
[CLS] things cooled down when they realized they were n ' t go ##n na get anything more from us and my security was very good at eva ##ding their ass ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] they had no access to my private underground parking garage and since i had a whole fleet of cars to choose from they never knew which one we were in if i felt like taking my woman out for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] since i did n ' t frequent the kind of establishments that cater ##ed to the papa ##raz ##zi or that hired people who ' d tip them off to us being there , we were left relatively in peace after the hub ##bu ##b had died down chapter 10 now it ' s the night of the last show and she was piss ##ing me off . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d had an argument of sorts that morning , well i would n ' t call it an argument exactly but there was definitely some tension . [SEP]
[CLS] we were la ##zing around having breakfast doing our usual thing , which was something the therapist had told her was helpful for her anxiety . [SEP]
[CLS] i was reaching over to pour her some orange juice when she sides ##wi ##ped me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace are we go ##n na get married ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she caught me off guard with that one , coming out of the blue like that and i guess i did n ' t handle the situation to her liking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we talk about this later after you ' re done with the show ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it was the best i could come up with on such short notice . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason my answer pissed her off . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been showing her met ##tle a lot here lately once she realized i was n ' t the type to fold my fist and punch her in the face just for kicks . [SEP]
[CLS] after she asked me that she got all quiet for the rest of the day and when she was n ' t slamming shit around the house she was ignoring me . [SEP]
[CLS] i decided to leave her to her mad and do some work in my office . [SEP]
[CLS] two hours before she was due to leave i cornered her in the shower and f * * ked her against the stall although she ' d tried to give me shit at first . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mine , you do n ' t tell me no ever no matter how f * * king pissed you are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i had my hand covering her wet crotch when i said that and moved it away to enter her swiftly . [SEP]
[CLS] as much of a fuss as she ' d made by the time i had her pinned to the wall , her legs were wrapped around my waist and her fingers were digging into my scalp as i f * * ked her to within an inch of her life . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d cleaned my c * * k off after i ' d off loaded inside her the second time and we ' d cleaned each other up after so i was under the impression that she was over her mad . [SEP]
[CLS] now she pulled this f * * king stunt . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d had a few conversations about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she was n ' t too comfortable with some of the costumes either but her wardrobe people chose them , i ' d put my foot down . [SEP]
[CLS] her talent did n ' t need any gi ##mm ##ick ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t expect her to dress like a nun on stage but neither did i expect her to show her ass to the world , not when that ass was now the exclusive property of trace mckenzie . [SEP]
[CLS] i waited until the number was almost at an end and she would be headed backstage for a clothes change . [SEP]
[CLS] i caught her as soon as she got off the stage and while her help ##ers were waiting to help her change i dragged her off to the dressing room and locked the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your next outfit had better be something more present ##able shia ##ne , or i swear to f * * k , i will drag your ass off that f * * king stage and take you home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t tell me how to do my job trace , i was doing this before we met and if you do n ' t like it . . . ' ' my hand came up and went around her throat and i pulled her face close to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` watch what the f * * k you say to me little girl , i ' m holding onto my temper by a thread , so unless you want me to heat up your little ass when we get home you ' d better quit while you ' re ahead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i wo n ' t be going home with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was pissed and obviously not thinking too clearly because of it or she would ' ve been more careful . [SEP]
[CLS] i laughed in her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` try it , there is n ' t a hole or rock big enough to hide your ass . [SEP]
[CLS] and if you get any one of these f * * ke ##rs around here to help you hide from me i will destroy the f * * k . ' ' i kissed her hard enough to bruise her lips before leaving her there . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew what she wanted but she was just going to have to wait . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a man and for a man there ' s always the right way and a wrong way to do things . [SEP]
[CLS] i headed back out my seat and that ' s when she really did it . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought i ' d made my point when i saw the long dress with the slit up the front . [SEP]
[CLS] but then one of the male dancers came up behind her and wrapped his arm around her from behind while she sang to him and they did some sort ##a two - step dance . [SEP]
[CLS] then he did something with his hand and the dress was at her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] she kicked it out of the way as the crowd went wild . [SEP]
[CLS] she had the nerve to dead at me was she sang and then and shook her ass at the crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought there was going to be a riot . [SEP]
[CLS] i sat there for the rest of the set until she left the stage for the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] by now my rage was a cool controlled anger sim ##mering inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i said nothing as i went backstage where everyone was cong ##rat ##ulating her on her performance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i walked over and took her elbow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait i have to . . . ' ' one look at my face had her changing ta ##ct . [SEP]
[CLS] she swallowed hard and i could see from her expression that she was finally getting that she ' d gone too far . [SEP]
[CLS] all the way in the car i sat away from her while she kept shooting me fur ##tive looks . [SEP]
[CLS] i kept my face straight ahead and my fists clenched as they hung between my thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] if i did anything else i ' m afraid i might st ##rangle her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as we got through the doors of home i grabbed her arm and headed for the bedroom and straight to where i kept the belt i used to wai ##l her ass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop trace you ca n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to pulling away from me which only enraged me more . [SEP]
[CLS] i grabbed the belt and was about to bring it down over her ass , not even waiting to get her und ##ressed i was so pissed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pregnant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] well f * * k , that sure stopped me in my tracks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t span ##k me , i ' m pregnant . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i dropped the belt and stared down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something strange going on with my heart . [SEP]
[CLS] it was beating yes , but the rhythm was off somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt a buzzing in my ears and i thin i lost sight there for a second . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pregnant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pulled her around to stand in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded and looked down at her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you tell me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just found out , i was going to tell you , then i asked you that question this morning and you blew me off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the memory seemed to renew her anger and she glared at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t about to try to trap you with a baby , i do n ' t want to marry someone who does n ' t really want me for me , i ' ve had one ass * * le in my life already . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grabbed her neck and lifted her off her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you never to throw that f * * ke ##r in my face . [SEP]
[CLS] just because you ' re carrying my child do not think for one minute that i wo n ' t heat your little ass up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the f * * k ever gave you the idea that i did n ' t want to marry you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you said . . . ' ' she raised her voice and started to yell . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` watch your f * * king tone , you ' re skating on thin f * * king ice . [SEP]
[CLS] what the f * * k ever gave you the idea that i ' m the kinda man who needs his woman to propose to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s my place , not f * * king yours no matter what some feminist new age f * * k says . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well it did n ' t look like you were go ##n na ask , now if you do , i ' ll always know it was only because of your precious child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i dragged her into the closet and over to the safe i kept hidden there . [SEP]
[CLS] it took me a few tries to get the combination i was that f * * king pissed . [SEP]
[CLS] opening the safe i retrieved the little velvet box i ' d kept there for months . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bought this two days after we met . [SEP]
[CLS] i was waiting for you to be finished with this before giving it to you . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace i . . . ' ' ` ` save it , i told you once i wo n ' t pay for what that ass * * le did to you . [SEP]
[CLS] not that that ' s clear let ' s talk about that shit you pulled tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you did n ' t want me , i thought . . . ' ' ` ` so you thought to get back at me by doing something that was sure to piss me off . [SEP]
[CLS] just a warning for the future babe , you do not ever want to piss me off . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be len ##ient with you when it comes to certain things , but outright di ##so ##bed ##ience will not be acceptable , not now not ever . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want me to leave your ass you pull a stunt like this again . [SEP]
[CLS] if i say no it means f * * king no do you hear me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she mumbled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re too f * * king spoil ##t for your own good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure if i should let this slide , but i do n ' t want the news of my child ' s conception to be marred by this f * * ke ##ry , and since you ' ve spoiled my proposal you can live with that shit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i took the box from her hand and put the five - cara ##t diamond on her finger . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not how i ' d wanted this to go . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d had everything planned out . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to take her to paris since that was her favorite place and propose to her there in one of their over priced swan ##ky restaurants . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not my style but it ' s hers so i was willing to do it to make the night special . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t make love to her that night . [SEP]
[CLS] not because of any punishment or anything like that , i think i was just overwhelmed a little if you wan na know the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d gone from extremely pissed and ready to heat up her ass , to learning that i was going to be a daddy or a dad . [SEP]
[CLS] instead i helped her get ready for bed and held her as she gave into the fatigue of the long day and night . [SEP]
[CLS] once again i recalled my childhood , the always wanting , never having and never any hope of having . [SEP]
[CLS] and the hunger , humiliation , all the things you can expect from a young boy whose parents neglected him . [SEP]
[CLS] and then when lily came along , my beautiful little sister , i remembered the fear in my gut that i would n ' t be able to protect her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the one and only baby i ' d ever held in my arms , and the love i ' d felt then , could n ' t be compared to what i felt for the un ##born child shia ##ne now kept safe in her womb . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought of her upcoming tour and knew there was no way i would let her go off on her own , not in her condition . [SEP]
[CLS] i came to the conclusion that it was time i delegate ##d more at work . [SEP]
[CLS] i had men and women that i ' d hired , the best in their fields , sometimes straight out of college , but had yet to trust anyone to do what i did . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an easy decision to make now , whereas before the thought gave me cold sweat ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i took the hand with my ring on it and kissed her finger as i hoped and prayed that i would get this right , then being as gentle as i could and not awake ##n her . [SEP]
[CLS] i lowered my body until my lips were in line with her still flat stomach and made a promise to my son or daughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` daddy will always be there little one , no matter what ; i ca n ' t wait to meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i felt the tears gather at the corner of my eyes , and though it had been years since i ' d shed one , i let them fall . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart had never been so full in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] i held her until the dawn and that ' s as long as i could hold out before taking her . [SEP]
[CLS] turning her silky soft body onto her back , i kissed my way down her body , stopping at her br * * sts . [SEP]
[CLS] i took the nipple of first one into my mouth , licking and sucking , pulling strong as i imagined one day my baby would , before going to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time i made my way down to her sweet cu ##nt , she was writhing beneath me . [SEP]
[CLS] i licked her clit until it was pee ##ping out from under its hood , then spreading her pu * * y lips open , i closed my eyes and feast ##ed on her flesh , her taste bursting into my mouth as i dug deep with my tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] sliding up her body , i slid into her going deep with one smooth thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were sleep - warm as she looked up at me . [SEP]
[CLS] with my hands holding both sides of her head , i held it back so i could look into her eyes as i loved her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love knowing my child is inside you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i let one of my handles cover her stomach between us for a brief moment before gathering her in close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me your mouth baby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she lifted her lips to mine and we stayed like that , our lips locked together passionate ##ly as i worked my c * * k in and out of her , her hips rising and falling with my thrusts . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the most amazing experience of my life so far , and there was so much more to come . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll make sure of it . [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue he ' s utterly unpredictable and totally insane my husband . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think i ' ve ever known a more volatile person in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad was an easy going mild manner ##ed man , sure he and mom had their ti ##ffs over the years when we were growing up , but i doubt he ' s ever done or said half the things has done to me . [SEP]
[CLS] like span ##king her ass with a belt . [SEP]
[CLS] since my announcement of my pregnancy , he ' s added one other element , over protective ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t get me wrong , i love it , in fact i think i need it because my hormones have been out of w ##ha ##ck from day one ; but i wondered how others would see him . [SEP]
[CLS] it started with my management team of all things , and a couple of the lawyers that handled my contracts . [SEP]
[CLS] the morning after our engagement , he ' d dropped the bombs ##hell that they had been robb ##ing me blind . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d sat there dumb ##founded , not having the first clue as to what i was supposed to do next . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry princess i ' ve got it covered . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ' but how did they and why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the how is easy , you do n ' t know what you ' re looking at when dealing with those things unless you ' ve done some kind of business class or you have someone reliable explain it to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was right i guess , as a small town girl , seeing all those zero ##s on my account balance was enough for me , i was just happy doing what i loved most and the fact that i was actually being paid , well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the why is that they ' re greedy f * * ks and they saw you coming a mile off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i guess they never bank ##ed on trace mckenzie coming into my life and turning everything upside down . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d wanted to do everything secretly after that , did n ' t want the bro ##uh ##aha that would follow if the public got ah ##old of it . [SEP]
[CLS] trace wanted to burn them at the stake . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end he convinced me that it was best to go public so that they would n ' t be free to do it to others . [SEP]
[CLS] turns out that was the right call , because after the story broke , others had come forward after realizing that they too had been victims of these un ##sc ##rup ##ulous men . [SEP]
[CLS] my tour started when i was five months along . [SEP]
[CLS] trace somehow found the time to leave work for almost two months and accompany me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d had to do some rear ##rang ##ing which meant there were hardly any breaks in between cities , but i wanted to be done before i really started to show . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s when i saw the other side of him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d hired all new management for me when i told him i was n ' t sure what to look for . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d threatened to fire my wardrobe staff until they had some kind of meeting and he got what he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end they ' d come up with more taste ##ful designs , though some of them were sex ##ier than the ones i ' d worn before . [SEP]
[CLS] he was right you did n ' t have to be half naked on stage to get your point across . [SEP]
[CLS] one day we were sitting at the kitchen table , i was still sitting in his lap because we ' d just made love while our breakfast had grown cold . [SEP]
[CLS] as he slipped out of my body i ' d said , ' you know we can do the proposal thing over ' . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d given me one of his looks and that was that . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess that ship had sailed . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t say that i felt deprived though , because in every way he was the perfect fiance and then husband . [SEP]
[CLS] our wedding was a very private affair in my hometown . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d moved heaven and earth to make it so and it was beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] he was completely fascinated with my body these days , especially after i started to show . [SEP]
[CLS] there was n ' t a day that went by that he did n ' t spend at least an hour playing with my tu ##mmy and having these long drawn out conversations with whoever was in there . [SEP]
[CLS] now though , i think he ' d reached his limit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trace it hurts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned over me as he held my hand in his and brushed my hair back with the other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know baby , i know it will be better soon . [SEP]
[CLS] do something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that last was said to the doctor and nurses that were there in the delivery room . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t shouted the words that they carried more force than if he had . [SEP]
[CLS] the way he see ##thed them through clenched teeth and glared at the room ' s occupants . [SEP]
[CLS] if i were n ' t in so much pain i would ' ve found it funny . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s coming along just fine mr . mckenzie . [SEP]
[CLS] just one more push shia ##ne , that ' s a good girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bore down with all my might as trace held my hand and whispered in my ear how proud he was of me and how beautiful i was . [SEP]
[CLS] i think it was his voice more so than anything urging from the doctor that gave me the extra boost i needed to push my son out into the world . [SEP]
[CLS] i laughed and cried as i heard his loud wai ##ls fill the room . [SEP]
[CLS] trace never took his eyes off mine until the oh - oh from the doctor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh - oh ? [SEP]
[CLS] no f * * king oh - oh , what the f * * k is oh - oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was ready to tear the poor woman ' s head off before she explained . [SEP]
[CLS] i was in too much of a daze from the new pain wr ##ack ##ing my body to help . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks like we have another one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and so my daughter was born , totally unexpected but completely loved . [SEP]
[CLS] the end chapter one i bounce from foot to foot as i try my mom ' s cell phone one more time . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m practically bursting at the seam ##s wanting to tell her my good news , and she ' s not answering . [SEP]
[CLS] i hang up the call as it goes to her voice ##mail again . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s been a little more un ##rea ##cha ##ble ever since she started dating this new mystery man . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' ll have to break down and tell me about him soon - we ' ve never been able to keep secrets from one another for long . [SEP]
[CLS] i give up and hold down the number 2 button on my old flip - phone to auto - dial my best friend allison . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she picks up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i got it ! [SEP]
[CLS] i got a lawn room ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shriek as soon as she answers , my excitement over ##flow ##ing into a wild ji ##g around my tiny dorm room . [SEP]
[CLS] allison screams on the other end in response - she knows what a huge deal this is for me . [SEP]
[CLS] there are only fifty - four lawn rooms at the university of virginia , where i ' m just finishing my junior year . [SEP]
[CLS] they were a central part of thomas jefferson ' s design for the school , and spread out under white columns from his famous rot ##unda . [SEP]
[CLS] they might be small and draft ##y , but living in one is a high honor . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a rigorous application process , and they are given to only the most academic ##ally - des ##erving rising seniors . [SEP]
[CLS] i worked my ne ##rdy butt off in preparation for this moment , and i can barely believe it ' s actually happening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , wait , i ' m putting you on speaker . [SEP]
[CLS] miriam ' s here , too , ' ' allison says when she finally takes a breath . [SEP]
[CLS] miriam is the third member of our little group that i met freshman year , and has both supported me and sheltered me through the first three years of college . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i ' m so proud of you ! [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , think of how many hundreds and hundreds of hours you worked for this moment ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gus ##hes . [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t remind me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i wince , thinking of how much of college life i ' ve missed while huddled in the back stacks of the library . [SEP]
[CLS] not that miriam and allison are academic sl ##ou ##ches either , far from it , all three of us could probably draw you a map of the library from memory . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and if it gets too cold in the winter , you can always come crash with us , ' ' allison adds . [SEP]
[CLS] she and miriam have been roommate ##s since sophomore year , and will be again next year . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve always invited me to apply for housing with them , but after freshman year , i decided i was too much of an intro ##vert for roommate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the fireplace is probably the best and worst part of the whole thing , ' ' i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] the lawn rooms have almost no trapping ##s of the modern world , so in the winter all you have to keep yourself warm is your own personal fireplace . [SEP]
[CLS] it sounds romantic now , but come next january , i imagine i might feel differently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you working tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] or can we celebrate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] miriam asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i work in the cafeteria as part of my work - study program to offset the cost of my tuition . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe we could go to dinner together , then see a movie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m not working , ' ' i admit , guilt already bubbling up from my stomach , ` ` but i was thinking i might go out with these girls from my pol ##i - sci class . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a short silence before allison speaks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , cool . . . sounds fun . [SEP]
[CLS] what are you guys going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , they invited me to this party at the crew house , ' ' i say , beginning to tug on the ends of my dark blonde hair - a nervous habit that only really gets out of control during finals . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the crew house ! ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison ex ##claim ##s , and i ca n ' t help but roll my eyes at her the ##at ##ric ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , you know as well as we do that those parties get insane ! [SEP]
[CLS] i heard that last semester nine of their varsity members got alcohol poisoning in one night ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , there are only eight on a team , so i think that might be an ex ##agger ##ation , ' ' i murmur . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` though i suppose maybe an alternate - ' ' ` ` bryn ##n , the point is , those parties are notorious ##ly crazy , ' ' miriam cuts in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want to see for myself , ' ' i say , trying to keep the frustration out of my voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll call you guys tomorrow morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . . . ' ' allison says warily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bye ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say quickly , before miriam can renew her argument , and hang up . [SEP]
[CLS] as wonderful as my two best friends are , i do get tired of how up ##tight they can be sometimes . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i do n ' t understand where it comes from . [SEP]
[CLS] the three of us were n ' t exactly popular during high school , and when we found each other during our freshman year orientation , it was such an amazing relief to be with like - minded girls . [SEP]
[CLS] we were all serious students , driven , with a pen ##chan ##t for fantasy books that might star vi ##gg ##o mort ##ense ##n in the movie adapt ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] but now , i ' m beginning to cha ##fe at the boundaries of our friendship . [SEP]
[CLS] particularly when it comes to going out to parties , and boys . [SEP]
[CLS] on my early morning trips to the library , i see girls doing the walk of shame across campus , their makeup smeared across their faces , hair rum ##pled , and first i feel pity , and then intense jealousy . [SEP]
[CLS] that post - sex glazed over look . . . if i ' m honest with myself , i want that too . [SEP]
[CLS] and i promised myself that if i got my lawn room , i ' d go to a party . [SEP]
[CLS] a real college party . [SEP]
[CLS] the kind miriam and allison roll their eyes at as they wonder how many brain cells its attendees are killing by the second . [SEP]
[CLS] this crew party is the perfect opportunity . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m trying not to get my hopes up , but it remains a possibility that i might actually get to talk to nate thorn ##hill tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] just the thought of his name is enough to send tingle ##s down my spine , though i know the real - life man could probably never live up to the fantasy i ' ve built up in my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i still remember the first time i saw him , walking across campus the second weekend of fall semester of freshman year . [SEP]
[CLS] i would ' ve bet my life then that he was a senior . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to the boys i had just left behind in high school , he was already a full - grown man . [SEP]
[CLS] he wore a navy blue polo like it was a second skin as he strode across the grass , jefferson ' s pal ##lad ##ian architecture spread out behind him like it was built as a set for a movie he was starring in . [SEP]
[CLS] he wore his wavy brown hair on the long side , and pushed back to keep it out of his dark blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] his nose was perfectly straight and ended over a pair of soft , full lips and a chin with an actual dim ##ple in it . [SEP]
[CLS] if it were possible for ryan go ##sling and a kennedy to have a baby , the result would be nate thorn ##hill . [SEP]
[CLS] i later learned that he was a double major like me , and since one of mine is political science and one of his is history , we overlap ##ped in a few of our core courses . [SEP]
[CLS] i expected him to sit in the back with the rest of the jock ##s but he was always in the front row , quick to raise his hand with intelligent answers . [SEP]
[CLS] i always hide right in the center of the halls ; my shy ##ness over ##w ##helm ##s me in those big lecture classes . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never got up the courage to actually talk to him , and besides , he always has a different girl on his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] with his looks , money , and being a star of both the lacrosse and crew teams , he draws women in like a magnet . [SEP]
[CLS] but tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] tonight i have promised myself that if he ' s at the party , i am going to introduce myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot off a quick text to cara , my new friend from class , to confirm that i ' ll join her tonight , and then turn to my closet . [SEP]
[CLS] i really only have one option to wear tonight : a simple , sl ##ink ##y black cam ##iso ##le with a lace in ##lay that i bought at the mall in spite of miriam and allison ' s nay ##say ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t know what i was buying it for then , but it ' s the kind of shirt i ' ve seen other girls wearing to parties . [SEP]
[CLS] i slip on jeans and a pair of heels that are probably a little low to be cool , but they ' ll have to do . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not like i have extra money to be adding to my wardrobe . [SEP]
[CLS] i take out the drug store makeup that i bought and sit at my desk . [SEP]
[CLS] i never usually wear anything but cha ##ps ##tick , but i watched some youtube tutor ##ials and feel confident i can mimic some of the techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] with a compact mirror , i carefully put on a little conceal ##er , blush , brown eye shadow , and black mascara . [SEP]
[CLS] i bought an eye ##liner , but i do n ' t use it . [SEP]
[CLS] i think it ' s a little beyond my skills . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sw ##ipe of some spark ##ly lip gloss , i ' m done . [SEP]
[CLS] i close the closet door and study myself in the full - length mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] with a start , i recognize myself in the reflection . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn my face side to side , searching for all its imperfect ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] with a little makeup on , my resemblance to my mom is more pronounced . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone always says she is beautiful , so maybe it ' s possible that i might be pretty , too . [SEP]
[CLS] the shirt is more low - cut than i remembered , and i touch my breasts self - consciously . [SEP]
[CLS] i get my large c - cups from my mom also , but i ' ve always kept them covered up . [SEP]
[CLS] i see how men get distracted by them , like they ' re some tractor beam pulling them in . [SEP]
[CLS] one more quick glance to check my mascara application , and i nod at myself , satisfied . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been a long time coming , but i think i ' m finally ready to party . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter two the spring night air is warm on my face as i walk across campus to meet cara and her friends . [SEP]
[CLS] i pass other students heading out for the night and feel happy to count myself among them . [SEP]
[CLS] i go over my rules for myself as i near the crew house , which is just across the street from campus . [SEP]
[CLS] no more than three drinks . [SEP]
[CLS] no talking about classes . [SEP]
[CLS] no weird ##ness around nate thorn ##hill . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cara yells from the opposite sidewalk . [SEP]
[CLS] i wave as i head over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you got a lawn room ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s amazing ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i lean over to give her a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s an effortlessly cool , petite brunette - the kind of girl that everyone considers to be their friend . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holy shit ! [SEP]
[CLS] you got a lawn room ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you , like , a genius or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her friend rachel asks , her jaw dropping . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish ! [SEP]
[CLS] then all those papers would have taken me way less time to write , ' ' i reply with a laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cara says you ' ve never been to a crew party ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] marie , the knockout of the group , asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope . . . just never made my way over here i guess , ' ' i reply , down ##play ##ing the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , they have the best parties , ' ' she assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and the hottest guys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lacrosse guys are hotter , ' ' rachel argues . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , if you can always do both . . . ' ' marie murmurs , and they burst into laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , you look great , by the way , ' ' cara says to me as we walk up the front steps of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` love that top . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' i say , trying not to glow . [SEP]
[CLS] a couple guys chilling on the front porch greet the other girls by name , and i blush as i feel their eyes glance over me . [SEP]
[CLS] i tug my hair self - consciously as one of them grins at me . [SEP]
[CLS] two girls hurry past us in the opposite direction . [SEP]
[CLS] one leans over the railing as her friend barely manages to pull her hair back before she re ##tch ##es into the bushes . [SEP]
[CLS] lovely . [SEP]
[CLS] sweat and the scent of beer greet ##s us as we walk inside . [SEP]
[CLS] the lights are dim , barely illuminating the mass of people crowded into the main room , and i feel my heels sticking to the sticky floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cara , the love of my life ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a tall , bra ##wny guy says , sweeping her up into a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize him from the crew team . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i ' ve studied their roster photos or anything . . . ` ` oh , ha , ha , ' ' cara says , rolling her eyes , though something about the gleam in her eyes tells me she likes the guy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i get you ladies a beer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , nodding to the ke ##g behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , please , ' ' cara says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , foster , this is my good friend bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] this is her first crew party so treat her nice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m always nice ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] foster says ind ##ignant ##ly , then bows in front of me and offers his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` m ' lady , ' ' he says , as i place my hand in his and raises it to his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] marie and rachel giggle and then head over to another group as foster hands them their beers . [SEP]
[CLS] cara and i follow foster over to an old , mysteriously stained , couch in the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] we weave around other scan ##ti ##ly clad co - eds , and for the first time in my life , i feel like one of the cool kids . [SEP]
[CLS] i perch nervously on the far left cushion as cara sits next to me , with foster on her other side . [SEP]
[CLS] i slowly sip my beer as he whispers in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve had beer before , even gotten tips ##y a few times with allison and miriam when we first turned twenty - one and tried out some wine bars . [SEP]
[CLS] i just want to make sure i do n ' t over ##do it tonight and end up like that girl we passed on the way inside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' s nate tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my head whip ##s around as i hear cara ask foster the question . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart stops for a second . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to admit i ' ll feel crushed if he ' s not even here . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s somewhere around , probably getting crushed under a pile of chicks , ' ' foster rolls his eyes , and cara laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] i down half my beer . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe how jealous it makes me feel , i ' ve never even met the guy . [SEP]
[CLS] cara and foster keep chatting , and though cara makes an effort to include me , i ' m feeling too nervous to contribute much to the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time i finish my beer , i really have to pee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be right back , ' ' i murmur to cara , and go looking for the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i weave through the sweaty th ##rong to a hallway along the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i see a line of five girls outside of what i assume is the bathroom , and with a sigh , i step behind the last one . [SEP]
[CLS] the door opens and a guy darts in front of the front girl . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she protests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry ! [SEP]
[CLS] emergency ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cries , and shut ##s the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean back a little and glance up the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several people hanging out on the landing , but it ' s definitely quieter up there , and i ' m sure there ' s more than one bathroom in this place . [SEP]
[CLS] holding my legs close together , i turn around and hurry up the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i bypass the first couple rooms with open doors and come to a couple closed ones . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see a room at the end of the hall that looks like a lounge , with a pool table in the middle of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] one of these two rooms must be the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean toward the nearest one and press my ear against it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t hear anything . [SEP]
[CLS] i knock softly and wait for a reply , and when i do n ' t hear one , i slowly turn the knob and open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as it ' s pulled open and out of my grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes fly up and immediately i realize that nate is standing before me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i . . . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer . [SEP]
[CLS] his pupils dil ##ate as he stares at me in amusement . [SEP]
[CLS] i let my gaze fall down his body . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s naked but for a pair of pale blue boxers . [SEP]
[CLS] good lord , his body is ridiculous . [SEP]
[CLS] the line down between his six - pack looks like it was etched in stone . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s suddenly very difficult to breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see anything you like ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks dr ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] i snap my gaze back up . [SEP]
[CLS] a brown curl of hair hangs just over one of his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i clear my throat as i try to think of something to say . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his eyes travelling over my body , my skin burning under his gaze as desire begins to pool in my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , no , i was - ' ' ` ` you wan na join us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , pulling the door open a little more . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over his shoulder and see a naked girl in bed covered in rum ##pled sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the girl says with a giggle , and pulls a sheet up over her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] if i were n ' t already naked , i ' d say you were und ##ress ##ing me with your eyes , ' ' he says smug ##ly to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my cheeks turn scarlet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , sorry , ' ' i murmur , ave ##rting my eyes and rushing down the hall to the stairs as i hear the girl dissolve into laughter behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i run straight out of the front door and down the front steps before stopping on the sidewalk to process what ' s just happened . [SEP]
[CLS] u ##gh , i ' m such an idiot . [SEP]
[CLS] i raise my hand to my mouth and wipe the back of my palm across my lips , sm ##earing off my lip gloss . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t belong at parties like this , and i certainly do n ' t belong with nate thorn ##hill . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been so embarrassed in my life . . . and how arrogant , asking me to join him and that girl as though i actually would ? [SEP]
[CLS] hot tears build up behind my eyes and threaten to spill over . [SEP]
[CLS] i had such high hopes for tonight , such high hopes for him . [SEP]
[CLS] and he ended up being so gross . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull my phone out of my wrist ##let and shoot off a quick text to cara : hey , just got a terrible headache . [SEP]
[CLS] headed back to my dorm . [SEP]
[CLS] see you later ! [SEP]
[CLS] i head back across campus and to the safety of my dorm room . [SEP]
[CLS] my phone buzz ##es and i pull it back out to see her response : feel better ! [SEP]
[CLS] i envy cara . [SEP]
[CLS] everything seems to come so easy to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she can fit in anywhere , make friends with anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i ' m just not that kind of person , much as i ' d like to be . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter three the words are a blur on the page in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i rub my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t sleep well last night , and now i ca n ' t concentrate on my notes . [SEP]
[CLS] we have a few days off at the beginning of the week to study , and then final exams . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let myself slip just because i got a lawn room , but the events of last night are distracting me and studying right now is nearly impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] my phone rings on the desk next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , mom ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say as i pick up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , honey ! [SEP]
[CLS] i just saw you called me a bunch yesterday ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i was out with pierce . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her melodic voice sounds a little breathless , as it always does when she talks about this new boyfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i have some good news . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me , too ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] um , do you want to go first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , i ' m going to be in town tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce and i were hoping to have dinner with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re in town ? ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s great news . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s not the news ! [SEP]
[CLS] do you want to wait to tell me your news until then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure . [SEP]
[CLS] why not ? [SEP]
[CLS] everything ' s ok , though , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything ' s great ! [SEP]
[CLS] we have a reservation for 7 o ' clock at dec ##ante ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] should we pick you up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just a short walk from campus . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wonderful ! [SEP]
[CLS] oh , i ' m so excited to see you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me too ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shut my phone feeling dumb ##founded . [SEP]
[CLS] now i ' m really not going to be able to study . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom ' s never surprised me like this before . [SEP]
[CLS] i frown . [SEP]
[CLS] could she and pierce be engaged , and she wants to tell me in person ? [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i ' d be happy for her , but i ' ve never met this guy before . [SEP]
[CLS] what if he ' s just one more jerk in the long line of low ##life ##s that she seems to attract ? [SEP]
[CLS] my mom is so gorgeous and always loved the attention her looks brought her , but her vanity has always worried me . [SEP]
[CLS] men are so willing to do everything for her , but they never seem to be the right kind of men . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of their character , she ' s always had a constant stream of admire ##rs , and has never had to do anything for herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she does n ' t know who she is or how to be alone . [SEP]
[CLS] when i came along , my dad showed his true colors and abandoned us , and she had no skills to fall back on as a twenty - two year - old single mother . [SEP]
[CLS] i always promised myself that i would n ' t let myself depend on a man like her . [SEP]
[CLS] i had to make sure i could make my own way in the world , which is probably why i ' ve had my nose in a book my whole life . [SEP]
[CLS] after several more hours of fruit ##less study , i decide to get ready a little early so that i can take a walk around campus before i meet my mom and her new boyfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] i put on a cotton summer dress and grab a card ##igan in case the restaurant is chilly . [SEP]
[CLS] i start to feel a little calm ##er when i reach the lawn and see the rot ##unda ' s white dome in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] the architecture always inspire ##s me , and next year i ' ll actually be living here . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand in front of the women ' s side of the lawn - gender ##s are separated - and wonder which room will be mine . [SEP]
[CLS] my mind drift ##s back un ##bid ##den to last night . [SEP]
[CLS] i so hoped to be able to expand my horizons a little . [SEP]
[CLS] as wonderful as i know getting a lawn room is , it ' s not everything . [SEP]
[CLS] the way nate ' s body looked in the low light from the hall . . . the small tu ##ft of hair that showed just above his boxers . . . the way he looked at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i realize i ' m tugging at my braid absent - minded ##ly , and shake my head at myself - i need to get it together . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s time to meet my mom and her new boyfriend , and hear their big news . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance around as i enter dec ##ante ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] its architecture is modern and elegant , a mix of cream fabrics and dark wood . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been here before - way out of my price range . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m about to approach the hostess when i recognize my mom in a prime booth in the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk toward her between a row of tables , hearing the hushed tones of conversation and the cl ##inking of wine glasses around me . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes light up and she stands as she sees me approaching . [SEP]
[CLS] she looks even more gorgeous than usual . [SEP]
[CLS] her blonde hair , a little lighter than mine , hangs in a long bob almost to her shoulders , and her perfect teeth show brightly behind her deep red lipstick . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve missed you , honey , ' ' she says , en ##vel ##oping me in a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look gorgeous . [SEP]
[CLS] is n ' t this dress a little big for you , though ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , pulling at the extra fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i like this kind of fit , ' ' i reply , allowing only the slightest bit of impatience to enter my voice . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a recurring conversation with us . [SEP]
[CLS] she always wants me to dress a little more feminine , a little more ` ` form - flat ##tering ' ' as she puts it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m so excited for you to meet pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just in the restroom - oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] here he is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i follow her gaze to an elegant ##ly dressed man with salt - and - pepper hair and blue eyes who ' s approaching us with a warm smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holly , i ' d think this was your sister if i did n ' t know any better , ' ' he says , and my mom giggles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i ' m pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] your mom has told me such wonderful things about you , ' ' he says as we shake hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` likewise , ' ' i reply politely , though the truth is that she ' s told me almost nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , let ' s sit . [SEP]
[CLS] i ordered us some champagne for the table . [SEP]
[CLS] it should be arriving soon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we all obe ##die ##ntly sit , me on one side of the cu ##sh ##y leather booth , and my mom and pierce on the other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , bryn ##n , you ' re in your junior year ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that ' s - ' ' i break off as my mom reaches for her water glass and i spot a ring on her left hand . [SEP]
[CLS] not an engagement ring , either . [SEP]
[CLS] a wedding ring . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask sharply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' my mom flutter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we were going to wait until my son arrived , but - ' ' ` ` we ' re married ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom announces suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] my jaw drops open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` married ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i squeak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , i thought maybe you ' d be engaged but married ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re upset ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , not upset . . . ' ' i struggle to put my emotions into the right words . [SEP]
[CLS] i always feel the need to protect my mom from what i ' m really feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s always been more fragile than me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just surprised , that ' s all . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , how long have you known each other ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we met six months ago , ' ' my mom says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and then pierce took me on a surprise trip to the turks and cai ##cos last week , and everything was just so perfect . . . ' ' she trails off , looking to him for support . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it really was , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] and it felt so right . [SEP]
[CLS] we wished you guys could have been there , but we just felt that we had to seize the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] it was in this little gaze ##bo on the cliff , with spectacular views of the water , and the captain of a boat that was docked at the resort off ##icia ##ted . . . ' ' ` ` it was engagement , honeymoon , and wedding in one ! [SEP]
[CLS] we just wished you and nate could have been there . [SEP]
[CLS] that would have made it even more perfect . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i struggle to catch up with all the information they ' re throwing at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , who ' s nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , nate ' s my son . [SEP]
[CLS] he goes to school here , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i tried to get a hold of him so we could tell you together , but - wait ! [SEP]
[CLS] there he is ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce slides out of the booth to wave to his son . [SEP]
[CLS] nate . [SEP]
[CLS] not nate . . . ` ` what ' s pierce ' s last name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper urgently to my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thorn ##hill , ' ' she whispers back distracted ##ly , sliding over to stand next to pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] oh my god . [SEP]
[CLS] nate thorn ##hill is here . [SEP]
[CLS] nate thorn ##hill is currently walking up behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] nate thorn ##hill is my new . . . step ##bro ##ther , i realize in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] beads of sweat form at my hair ##line and i ' ve suddenly lost my appetite . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter four as nate walks into my periphery , i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] i can not believe this is happening . [SEP]
[CLS] surely i ' m in the middle of some strange nightmare and will wake up soon . [SEP]
[CLS] i hoped i ' d never have to see him again after last night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , honey , this is nate , pierce ' s son , ' ' my mom says , cutting through the fog of emotion in my brain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` h - hi . [SEP]
[CLS] nate . [SEP]
[CLS] bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m bryn ##n , ' ' i st ##am ##mer as he glances over at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , pleasure to meet you , ' ' he replies formally . [SEP]
[CLS] wait , does he not even remember meeting me last night ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , sc ##oo ##ch over bryn ##n , so nate can sit , ' ' mom says , waving me over with her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , sorry , ' ' i say , sliding over so that he can sit next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare straight ahead as he sits . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my body betray ##ing me already . [SEP]
[CLS] the heat from his leg under the table is giving me heart pal ##pit ##ations . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thought you were n ' t going to be able to make it , ' ' pierce says a little tense ##ly to his son . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , i was in the library studying . [SEP]
[CLS] i had my phone off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you missed the big announcement . [SEP]
[CLS] we were just telling bryn ##n that holly and i have gotten married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye . [SEP]
[CLS] i see his eyes widen in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` married ? [SEP]
[CLS] i thought you said you ' d never get married again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , things change . [SEP]
[CLS] when i met holly , i just knew . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll see when you get to know her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a special woman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i watch my mom glow like a 1000 watt bulb and ca n ' t help but smile . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen her so happy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i ' m . . . i ' m just . . . ' ' i watch him struggle for words just like i did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] but happy . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m looking forward to getting to know you better , holly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] wow , that was . . . kind . [SEP]
[CLS] not what the guy i met last night would say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , me too , nate , ' ' my mom replies , looking over ##joy ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m so excited for you and bryn ##n to get to know each other ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` two only children . . . ' ' pierce says meaningful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll have to learn to share . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom laughs and i join in weakly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you always wanted a sibling , bryn ##n ! [SEP]
[CLS] and now you have one ! [SEP]
[CLS] well , a step - sibling , but still . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a step - sibling that i ' ve had literally dozens of dirty dreams about . [SEP]
[CLS] perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , you two have never met , then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks , glancing between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce and i were so excited when we realized both our kids were juniors here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uv ##a is my alma mater , ' ' pierce adds proudly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , we ' ve never met , ' ' i break in quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] i see nate eye me for a second before he nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , never met , unfortunately , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we thought it best not to tell you guys about us until we knew it would really be forever . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought it would have just been so awkward for you two if we ' d broken up and then you have to keep seeing each other around campus , ' ' my mom explains . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that would have been awkward , ' ' nate says dr ##ily , and i know he ' s thinking that nothing could compare to my own awkward ##ness last night . [SEP]
[CLS] the waitress comes over with the bottle of champagne that pierce ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] dom per ##ignon , i see as i look at the label . [SEP]
[CLS] whoa , he must be loaded . [SEP]
[CLS] my new step ##dad must be loaded . [SEP]
[CLS] she expert ##ly pops the cork and pour ##s us each an elegant flute , placing the bottle into a wine cooler next to the table . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce takes his glass and raises it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to a new family , ' ' he says , looking around the table . [SEP]
[CLS] we all raise our glasses and cl ##ink them together . [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to do so without making eye contact with nate . [SEP]
[CLS] the champagne tick ##les my throat on the way down . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never wanted to drink a bottle of alcohol more in my entire life than at this moment , but i keep myself to a modest sip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , honey , you told me you had some news , too ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks , as she puts down her glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , yes , though i do n ' t think i can follow that announcement , ' ' i hedge with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please ! [SEP]
[CLS] you sounded excited on the phone , ' ' she encourages me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i got a lawn room , ' ' i reveal . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom gasps in excitement , but i see pierce glance quickly at his son . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you said that they had n ' t announced it yet , ' ' he says quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i knew you ' d be disappointed . [SEP]
[CLS] i was wait ##list ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] it was difficult , jug ##gling two varsity sports , a double major - ' ' nate replies . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at my mom and then between the two men . [SEP]
[CLS] nate is looking down at the table ##cloth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was selected for a lawn room , too , ' ' pierce says , interrupting him and turning to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s an important accomplishment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . . . ' ' i say hesitantly . [SEP]
[CLS] nate looks so miserable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` being wait ##list ##ed is impressive , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glances up at me sharply , his eyes flashing . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i heard it , too : pity . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , congratulations , both of you , ' ' my mom breaks in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have no idea what i ' m going to order ! [SEP]
[CLS] everything looks so wonderful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she runs her finger down the menu in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] having grown up in a family of irish immigrants , my mom has always avoided conflict like the plague , though this time i ' m glad for the change of subject . [SEP]
[CLS] i decide to order the steak since money does n ' t seem to be an issue , and we each order a cocktail in addition to the champagne . [SEP]
[CLS] something begins to tug at the back of my brain after the waitress leaves to put in our food orders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce , i ' m sorry if this is an ignorant question , but were you in office ? [SEP]
[CLS] your name sounds so familiar . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' he replies , looking pleased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m a former congressman - ' ' ` ` - for virginia . [SEP]
[CLS] now i remember . [SEP]
[CLS] you helped pass the campaign finance reforms . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good memory . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one of my majors is political science , so i try to keep up with it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and your other major ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` global health . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i run thorn ##hill and co . [SEP]
[CLS] consulting of k street , and we ' re still looking for a summer intern . [SEP]
[CLS] interested ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad , i thought you were going - ' ' nate breaks in before i can respond . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i thought you were going to get a lawn room , ' ' his dad replies , keeping his voice light . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , bryn ##n , what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , um , i was just going to get a summer job back in maryland to help pay for tuition , ' ' i murmur . [SEP]
[CLS] did pierce promise his son the internship ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to start off this relationship with nate on the wrong foot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t need to worry about tuition now , honey , ' ' my mom says softly . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at her in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] oh my god - is pierce going to pay for my college bills ? [SEP]
[CLS] the thought had n ' t even occurred to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i look between them as they stare back at me calmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , oh , i did n ' t think - i mean , i ' d love to , but i just - if nate wants the - ' ' ` ` then it ' s settled , ' ' pierce cuts in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i tend to go into the office quite early , but we have an extra car you can use . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , pierce and i are moving in together . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i basically live there now , but i ' m officially selling the old house , now that we ' re married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . [SEP]
[CLS] of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my brain scramble ##s to process all the new information . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i ' m working it all out , i feel a hand on my knee . [SEP]
[CLS] i look down in surprise to see nate ' s arm disappearing under the table ##cloth . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s looking straight ahead as though nothing ' s happening . [SEP]
[CLS] i struggle to maintain my composure as heat travels from his hand and all the way up to . . . ` ` so , this summer , i ' ll be living with you then ? [SEP]
[CLS] all of you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate turns to smile at me politely . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand moves another inch up the bare skin of my thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] i widen my eyes at him but he does n ' t react . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll all be living at pierce ' s house - ' ' ` ` our house , ' ' pierce correct ##s my mom with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our house , in potomac . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s got tons of space , beautiful views of the river . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' ll be wonderful to have the summer to bond with each other , and really become a family . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s hand moves another inch up my leg . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the rough , call ##ouse ##d skin of his palm . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been so turned on in my life , but i ' m struggling against it . [SEP]
[CLS] what is he thinking ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re at dinner with our parents ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you have some stuff at the old house , but we ' ll have it moved to the new one . [SEP]
[CLS] everything will be all set up when you get home , ' ' my mom says , smiling at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' i reply , trying to focus on her words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t that attached to the old place anyway , ' ' i add with a shrug . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d moved a couple times after my dad left , so no one place has ever felt like home . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s hand moves another inch up my thigh , pushing up the hem of my dress so his fingers rest under it . [SEP]
[CLS] my whole body is tingling . [SEP]
[CLS] holy hell , i can barely breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m shocked pierce and my mom do n ' t seem to notice that anything ' s happening . [SEP]
[CLS] with his other hand , nate takes a calm sip from his champagne flute . [SEP]
[CLS] where ' s the waitress ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' ll have to move his hand when the food comes . [SEP]
[CLS] he moves his hand up another inch . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t take it any longer - another second and i ' m going to start moaning . [SEP]
[CLS] as my mom moves her head to pierce ' s ear to murmur sweet nothing ##s , i slide my fork off the table and press it tong ##s - first into the top of nate ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him make a sharp intake of breath and then his mouth twitch ##es as he tries to hold position through the pain . [SEP]
[CLS] i press down harder . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly he yank ##s his hand away and i just manage to stop my hand in time so the fork does n ' t hit my leg . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns to me and smiles , a wicked g ##lim ##mer in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was fucking with me , i realize . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s his way of taking revenge for me showing him up in front of his dad ? [SEP]
[CLS] what a goddamn creep ! [SEP]
[CLS] i lean toward him with a fake smile plastered on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re that pissed about it , bring it up with your dad , do n ' t take it out on me . [SEP]
[CLS] i did try to turn it down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hiss into his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns to me with an equally fake smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll do whatever the hell i like , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says quietly so our parents ca n ' t hear . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the meal passes without nate making another fake pass at me . [SEP]
[CLS] the gears in my brain begin to move as i think about how i ' m going to be spending the entire summer , and potentially many other seasons , living with this guy . [SEP]
[CLS] my life has been completely up ##ended tonight , and i need some time to process everything . [SEP]
[CLS] after the waitress clears our coffee cups and pierce takes care of the bill with a black am ##ex card , we stand up to say goodbye . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re going to drive back to maryland tonight since it takes under three hours . [SEP]
[CLS] i hug pierce goodbye , then my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know this was a lot to take in , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll talk everything over , i promise , ' ' she whispers reassuring ##ly , then kisses me on the cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile at her and begin to tear up - i ' m pretty overwhelmed . [SEP]
[CLS] nate surprises me by leaning in for a hug as our parents look on with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great to meet you , ' ' he says , then whispers almost silently in my ear , ` ` sorry , we ' ll never get a chance to have that three ##some , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i freeze as he pat ##s my back once and then breaks away . [SEP]
[CLS] he remembered . [SEP]
[CLS] and now he will always know how attracted i am to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a feeling i ' m never going to hear the end of it . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter five ` ` i do n ' t mean to question the relationship , it was just so sudden , ' ' i explain to my mom as she drives me home from the airport . [SEP]
[CLS] i usually never fly to or from college , but pierce insisted . [SEP]
[CLS] my biggest worry was that nate and i might be on the same flight , but luckily his exams ended earlier than mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i want as much time as possible to prepare myself for our interactions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i get it , i really do , ' ' my mom assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can ask me anything about pierce , or me and pierce , and i wo n ' t be upset . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he treats you well ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s always surprising me with little gifts , trips , even . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know what i ' ve done to deserve him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i think you ' re pretty great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i offer dramatically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i did n ' t mean it like that ! [SEP]
[CLS] i just mean , pierce treats me like a princess . [SEP]
[CLS] and the house is basically a castle , ' ' she adds , pointing to her right . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp at the flags ##tone mansion we ' re pulling alongside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shut up . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s his house ! ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s huge ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom replies with a laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it has maid ' s quarters ! [SEP]
[CLS] but you ' ll get used to it , really . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s a maid ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he used to have a housekeeper / maid who would cook for him , but now i do most of that stuff . [SEP]
[CLS] i love having someone else to cook for again . [SEP]
[CLS] the maid just comes once a week now to do a really thorough cleaning , ' ' she explains as we pull through the wrought - iron gates leading the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you still working at the salon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she used to support herself as a mani ##cu ##rist at the tiny salon back in our small town in eastern maryland . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , not anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m volunteer ##ing , though , and thinking of joining some charitable boards , ' ' she says non ##chal ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom , a lady who lunch ##es , i think , shaking my head . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i can see it . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom presses a button on the car ' s dashboard and one of the two garage doors opens . [SEP]
[CLS] we pull inside and i look around at the huge space as the door closes behind us . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' m this in shock about the size of the garage , i ca n ' t imagine how i ' ll feel about the rest of the place . [SEP]
[CLS] after the tour , which took over an hour because the house is so massive , my mom finally leads me to my room . [SEP]
[CLS] my head is swimming at the lavish ##ness of my new home . [SEP]
[CLS] as we walk down the plush ##ly carpet ##ed hallway , i ' m alarmed to realize that i can actually smell nate . [SEP]
[CLS] he must be nearby somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been dread ##ing seeing him again and hoped i ' d have more time to settle in before our first confrontation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s nate ' s room , ' ' my mom says as we pass a partially open door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s out somewhere right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head at myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could turn off the part of my body that ' s attracted to him . [SEP]
[CLS] if anything , though , my sex dreams about him have only become more frequent and more alarm ##ing ever since he laid his hand on my thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here ' s your room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe it ' s right next door to nate ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] there are so many rooms in this place - i would have preferred to have a bit more separation between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , ' ' i say as she pushes the door open , and my mis ##giving ##s about the room are forgotten . [SEP]
[CLS] a canopy with a delicate white fabric settled on it hangs over the four - poster bed in the center of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] a matching nightstand , bureau , and vanity make up the rest of the furniture . [SEP]
[CLS] the wall ##paper is a taste ##ful , blue and white pattern with small birds on it that complement ##s the light , air ##y feel of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i release the handle of my luggage and head over the to the window seat and knee ##l on it . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a spectacular view of the potomac river below - the house was clearly built to play up the amazing location . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance to my left . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that my own bathroom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yu ##p - no more sharing ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom replies gail ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] i step inside and admire the all - white tile and huge tub . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been in a house so nice . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i ' m actually going to call this place home from now on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want anything to eat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks from the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yeah , that would be great , ' ' i call over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , i ' ll whip something up . [SEP]
[CLS] you stay here and get settled . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be in the kitchen when you ' re ready to eat . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i wander back into the bedroom as my mom disappears down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] there is one question i have that i ca n ' t bring myself to ask her . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . i know my mom worries about money , about me graduating from school with so much debt . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not that i think she would have married pierce just for the money , but i worry that it might have clouded her judgment a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] they got married so quickly - can she really know him that well ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i ' m just falling back into my usual pattern of co - dependency and mother ##ing her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a grown woman , i ca n ' t control what she does and i ' m not responsible for her decisions . . . not to mention , i am hugely relieved to not have to carry around student loans for the rest of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] i kick my sandals off and sink back down onto the window seat . [SEP]
[CLS] the potomac is a dark green sl ##iver barely visible through the bush ##y trees that line the back of the estate and continue down to the shoreline . [SEP]
[CLS] i start ##le as a figure breaks the stillness . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize nate ' s head as he walks up from the lower lawn to the pool , a lacrosse stick tucked over his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] she ##esh - is he training already ? [SEP]
[CLS] school just ended ! [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip as i watch him toss the stick on the deck and peel off his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] he uses it to wipe the sweat off his face , then toss ##es it on a chair and kicks off his sneakers . [SEP]
[CLS] his body is just . . . impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i guess it makes sense . [SEP]
[CLS] two varsity sports are probably enough to give anyone a body like a greek god , but he also has the face to match . [SEP]
[CLS] he jumps in the pool and i watch him swim a lap , the cool blue water cas ##ca ##ding over his muscular back and shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to get used to seeing him like this - and stop acting like a total freak every time we ' re in the same room . [SEP]
[CLS] this is my new normal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your food ' s ready ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom calls upstairs , her voice echoing a bit in the multi - level foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] i jump up and head downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn into a formal dining room before finding my way to the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] i stop as i realize the kitchen windows look directly out onto the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] great . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe nate ' s already in the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] the water ' s still freezing , ' ' my mom comments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , he ' s crazy . . . ' ' i reply , before i really hear what she said . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m too distracted by nate ' s backstroke , his arms cutting clean ##ly through the water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you two never once ran into each other on campus in the three years you ' ve been at uv ##a ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , sliding a b ##lt onto the glass table in the breakfast no ##ok . [SEP]
[CLS] we sit down across from each other and i start eating . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , well . . . we had n ' t ever met . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom dig ##s , hearing a slight hesitation in my voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , nate ' s really well known around campus . [SEP]
[CLS] he starts on the lacrosse and crew teams , he ' s smart , good - ' ' i catch myself and pretend to clear my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good - looking ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom . . . ' ' i groan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , he is . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not blind . [SEP]
[CLS] actually , pierce looked just like him when he was his age . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i see nate get out of the pool over my mom ' s shoulder and shake himself off . [SEP]
[CLS] i force myself to look down at my sandwich as he walks across to a lawn chair and lies down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened to nate ' s mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom wince ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce does n ' t really like to talk about it - too painful . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently , she cheated on him and then abandoned him and nate . [SEP]
[CLS] they never see her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , that ' s awful , ' ' i murmur , trying to shove down the twin ##ge of pity i feel for my new step ##bro ##ther . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think it ' s one of the things that brought us together - raising a child by ourselves . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes flick to the door as nate slides it open . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s put his shirt back on but it cl ##ings to his still damp torso , emphasizing his muscular pe ##cs and shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] he drops his sneakers on the mat as he shut ##s the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey nate , ' ' my mom greet ##s him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like a sandwich ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to do that , ' ' he says , a little gruff ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mind at all , ' ' she replies , standing to move back to the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses , then sits in her abandoned chair a bit reluctantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so funny that you and bryn ##n never met at school ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think there might have been one time - ' ' he says , glancing at me , that same devil ##ish look back in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table , and i quickly cross my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in class . [SEP]
[CLS] we have been in a few of the same classes together , ' ' i clarify , narrowing my eyes at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks looking genuinely surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom quietly spreads mayo on a slice of bread at the marble island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' i whisper , embarrassed . [SEP]
[CLS] of course he would n ' t remember all of the times we ' ve sat in the same classroom - only the time when i og ##led him in the doorway of his bedroom and completely embarrassed myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i blush . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to sink into this seat cushion and disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] he frowns at me then turns his palm over and begins to pick at a call ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so honey , pierce says you ' ll start your internship on monday , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' ll give you a few days to settle in , ' ' my mom says as she slides the sandwich in front of nate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good , ' ' i reply , glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m having someone over for dinner tomorrow night , ' ' he announces rather abruptly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] a friend from around here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not a friend , really . [SEP]
[CLS] a girl i dated in high school , ' ' nate cl ##ari ##fies . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep my eyes trained carefully forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know if she has any dietary restrictions ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks , excitedly flying into hostess mode . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could make this chicken dish my mom passed down , or . . . ' ' i tune out as she offers more ideas , and polish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and go upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] so now i have to have dinner with nate ' s ex - girlfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] is this what the rest of the summer is going to be like ? [SEP]
[CLS] nate punish ##ing me for his father ' s favor by exploit ##ing my attraction to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d rather be back in the library , buried in a book . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter six i push the sa ##ute ##ed chicken around my plate as i try not to watch nate dr ##ape his arm around the back of dana ' s chair . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s pretty . [SEP]
[CLS] very pretty . [SEP]
[CLS] and sweet . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish she were n ' t so sweet so i could hate her for a good reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how long did you two date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , it was on and off , so . . . hard to say . [SEP]
[CLS] he actually went to prom with one of my friends , ' ' she replies , joking ##ly nu ##d ##ging nate , who at least has the grace to blush . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . ' ' his dad says , shaking his head ad ##mon ##ishing ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] i went with one of his friends , ' ' dana says with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we both knew it was n ' t meant to be . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a couple of my friends met their husbands in high school , ' ' my mom says , resting her fork on her plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` though i read an article recently that said that twenty - eight percent of women meet their husbands in college . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looks pointedly at me and i jump up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll clear , ' ' i announce . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a feeling i know where this conversation is headed and i want to avoid it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , thank you , bryn ##n , ' ' pierce says , as i stack the plates on top of one another . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problem , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i waited tables in high school . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` same , ' ' nate says , as i reach in front of him to take his plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did not , ' ' i re ##tort , before i can think . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks up at me and raises his eyebrows , his gaze un ##rea ##dable beneath them . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my dad says working is the only way to build character , ' ' nate reports quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' i say , blushing as i push my way through the swinging door into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] i place the china carefully next to the sink and lean onto the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] god , i feel like i ca n ' t say anything right around nate . [SEP]
[CLS] my mind freeze ##s up while my body is set on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , are you dating anyone at school , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce asks . [SEP]
[CLS] damn him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not right now , ' ' i reply , sitting back down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who were you dating ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i know him , ' ' nate says , his dark eyes picking up the candle ##light in the table ' s elaborate center ##piece . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom spent all afternoon on it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably not , ' ' i say eva ##sive ##ly , past ##ing a polite smile on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] he really knows how to get under my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] the truth is , i ' ve never really dated anyone , much as my mom pushes me , and as much as i ' m embarrassed by the fact . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who wants dessert ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to sides ##te ##p any more questioning by bringing out the last course , though now i ' m starting to think about the fact that nate and dana are probably going to want to go off somewhere after this and have sex . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope it ' s not in nate ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] what if i can hear them through the wall ? [SEP]
[CLS] my mom insists on clearing the dessert plates , and nate and dana stand up . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce and nate start talking quietly , and dana comes over to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are so gorgeous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she offers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to ask : what do you use on your skin ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i - what ? [SEP]
[CLS] um , soap ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] oh man , she really makes it difficult to hate her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` soap ? [SEP]
[CLS] just . . . soap ? [SEP]
[CLS] oh my god , i have this whole routine , ' ' she says , laughing at herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i ' ll be seeing you around often ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , but she looks surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you and nate are dating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not really dating , ' ' she con ##fide ##s to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s not the type , and i gave up hope years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] but just look at him - can you blame me for coming back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she says with a grin , then her eyes widen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my go ##sh - sorry ! [SEP]
[CLS] i forgot for a second that he ' s your brother ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` step - brother , ' ' i correct her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m go ##n na head upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] it was really nice to meet you , dana . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you , too , ' ' she replies , stepping away to join pierce and nate ' s conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i need some air . [SEP]
[CLS] i find myself heading down the hallway and to the french doors in the wood - panel ##ed study . [SEP]
[CLS] they open onto the patio and i step outside with relief , closing the door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] the firm breeze from the river calls me forward and i head down toward it . [SEP]
[CLS] i circle around the swimming pool on the first level of the backyard , and then down to a grassy lawn with a lacrosse goal set up on one end . [SEP]
[CLS] the wooden stairs down to the rocky beach are set on the right side , and it takes me a minute to find them in the dark . [SEP]
[CLS] as i head down the steps , i see the potomac spread out in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] the water rushes hung ##rily by , lit only by the sparsely set houses on the cliffs surrounding it . [SEP]
[CLS] as i step onto the shore , i can feel the rocks pressing up through my sandals , and boulders casting long , dark shadows on either side of me . [SEP]
[CLS] this is no white - sand beach . [SEP]
[CLS] the river runs dangerously fast after rains , and there are even white - water rapids along parts of it . [SEP]
[CLS] i look back at the steps behind me and then back out at the river . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel so out of place here . [SEP]
[CLS] even though our old house did n ' t really feel like home either , i wish i were there now , stretched out on the rat ##ty old couch , with my mom in her chair , watching something on our small tv . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i ' ll ever be able to feel like i belong here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll always feel like a guest in pierce ' s house . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk down closer to the water until i can feel the pebbles getting smaller underneath my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want my shoes to get wet . [SEP]
[CLS] i jump as a bird breaks out of a tree above me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just see it as it flies off , its body a moving ink b ##lot against the dark sky . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could follow it . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn and walk back toward the steps , feeling as lonely as i ' ve ever felt . [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom is happy , and i ' m fortunate to live in a place like this . [SEP]
[CLS] stop feeling sorry for yourself , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] as i walk across the lower lawn , i look up and see my mom and pierce ' s bedroom light go off . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess they ' re turning in early tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk up toward the pool and freeze as i hear a moan . [SEP]
[CLS] the lights downstairs are all off except one in the hall , and the pool ' s lights underneath the water . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes dart around and fall on two writhing bodies on a pools ##ide lounge chair . [SEP]
[CLS] nate and dana . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare as nate whip ##s off his own shirt and then dana ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i should move but i do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] the blue pool lights shi ##mmer against his back muscles as he expert ##ly undo ##es dana ' s bra and pulls off her pants and underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] leave , you per ##vert ! [SEP]
[CLS] my brain commands me , but my body stays firmly glued in place , even as it th ##ro ##bs with desire . [SEP]
[CLS] one of nate ' s hands massage ##s dana ' s ample breasts , and the other disappears beneath her . [SEP]
[CLS] dana cries out immediately and i almost gasp myself , as though his hands are moving against me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can practically feel his touch on me , his hot breath against my ear as his expert fingers move inside me . . . nate grunt ##s and pushes against her . [SEP]
[CLS] she struggles to contain herself as he thrusts slowly in and out of her . [SEP]
[CLS] oh my god - what am i doing ! ? [SEP]
[CLS] i step back with a jolt as though i ' m breaking out of a trance and almost trip over the hydra ##nge ##a bush next to me in my hurry to get away . [SEP]
[CLS] i run as quickly and quietly as i can around the side of the house and to the front . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach the front door and pray that nate is going to lock up later . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the door ##k ##nob turn and push the door open in relief . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry up the curving staircase and down the hall into my room , kicking off my sandals before hurling myself onto my bed and burying my head in the pillows . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my cheeks burning with mort ##ification over what i just witnessed and the un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble desire i felt . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve had crush ##es before , but none like my obsession with nate . [SEP]
[CLS] and even after finally meeting him , only to have him tease me and push my buttons , i still feel so physically drawn to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull my face out of the pillow and crawl to the nightstand , pulling my dog - ear ##ed copy of lady chatter ##ley ' s lover out of the top drawer . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i ' m opening it to the folded - over page , there ' s a quiet knock at my door . [SEP]
[CLS] i toss my book on the bed and walk to it , hoping and praying it ' s not nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost jump as i pull open the door and nate ' s face appears , sh ##roud ##ed in the darkness of the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] he leans forward , leaning his forearm on the door ##ja ##mb as i step back nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] his wavy hair looks particularly un ##ru ##ly , and his lips are curved in a slight smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` technically speaking , does a pee ##ping tom have to be outside , looking inside ? [SEP]
[CLS] or does the term still apply if both , or all three , parties are outdoors ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , calmly , tilting his chin up slightly as he considers me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i do n ' t . . . ' ' i st ##am ##mer , feeling heat crawl up the back of my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you . [SEP]
[CLS] were . [SEP]
[CLS] watching us , ' ' he accuse ##s me , narrowing his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to . [SEP]
[CLS] i just . . . i was down at the river . . . how did you . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i heard a t ##wig snap and saw you running away like a drunken os ##tric ##h . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did dana - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , and i did n ' t tell her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank god . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? [SEP]
[CLS] what did you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smirk ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry , again . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so embarrassed , ' ' i rush on . [SEP]
[CLS] it strikes me that this is the longest conversation i ' ve ever had with my new step ##bro ##ther . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s about how i ' m a per ##vert . [SEP]
[CLS] fantastic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why were you watching us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , stepping forward into my room . [SEP]
[CLS] i take another step away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , i . . . i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] it just sort of happened . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` liar , ' ' he comments lightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` asshole . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it slips out before i can stop myself . [SEP]
[CLS] he tilt ##s his head slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pr ##ude , ' ' he levels at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i look down . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i am a pr ##ude , but i do n ' t want to be . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] when i look back up at him , i see him gazing past me , to my book on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing , just a book , ' ' i say , but he ' s bree ##zing past me toward it . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry after him but he reaches the bed before me and picks up the book . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say defiant ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know what lady chatter ##ley ' s lover is about , ' ' he says , looking at me with a smug grin . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe not such a pr ##ude after all , ' ' he adds , running his eyes up and down my body . [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know what i think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , stepping toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] i step away again , feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you want me . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you can barely contain yourself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s mighty arrogant of you , ' ' i comment . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to tug the ends of my hair nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you doing that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just a nervous habit , ' ' i say with a shrug , and drop my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i make you nervous ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' i reply quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just you being in here . . . ' ' ` ` i ' m only arrogant if i ' m wrong . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wrong about what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the urge to pull my hair again but do n ' t want to give him the satisfaction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wrong about you wanting me . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s give it a test - ' ' he narrows his eyebrows , studying me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to kiss you now , and all you have to do is tell me to stop . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention you just fucked dana , and now you expect me to kiss you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i protest , but he steps toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] i try to pull backward but i ' m already pressed against my bed ##post . [SEP]
[CLS] desire un ##fur ##ls deep in my stomach as his eyes lock onto mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if it ' s crazy , just tell me to stop , ' ' he whispers teasing ##ly , and moves closer . [SEP]
[CLS] his mu ##sky scent fills my nose and my mind begins to swim . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel wet ##ness trick ##ling down my thigh as he curls his arms around me , grasping the bed ##post with both hands behind my lower back . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s so close to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel heat radiating off him . [SEP]
[CLS] his legs and chest sink against me and he moves his lips toward mine . [SEP]
[CLS] just a few inches between nate thorn ##hill ' s mouth and mine . [SEP]
[CLS] now an inch . [SEP]
[CLS] now two centimeters . . . i can feel his warm breath against my partially open lips . . . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] he freeze ##s but does n ' t pull away , as though he ca n ' t believe what he ' s just heard . [SEP]
[CLS] though truth ##fully , i ' m marvel ##ing at my own restraint . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his erection against my thigh - i know he wants me , too . [SEP]
[CLS] now i can beat him at his own game . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean forward slightly , allowing my lips to brush against his as i speak , ` ` unless you do n ' t want to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes , which were focused on my lips , flick back up to meet mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i force myself to stay steady even as i ' m consumed by the lust in his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] he stares at me for a moment , then pushes off the bed ##post and steps back . [SEP]
[CLS] he opens his mouth , about to say something , but nothing comes out . [SEP]
[CLS] i remain pressed against the bed ##post as he turns and moves toward the door . [SEP]
[CLS] without looking back , he shut ##s it behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] i stumble forward and take a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like he takes all the air out of the room and i ca n ' t breathe when he ' s around . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i just rejected him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m stunned , but i also feel like giving myself a standing o ##vation . [SEP]
[CLS] i just resisted the advances of nate thorn ##hill , my fantasy of almost three years . [SEP]
[CLS] i should win a will ##power award . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew that if i ' d let him kiss me , i would forever lose any kind of power in our relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d be just be another pathetic girl who fell for his charms . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , the downs ##ide is that i ' m more turned on than i ' ve ever been in my life , and i ' m alone with a book again . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh and crawl back onto my bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my step ##bro ##ther , i have n ' t seen the end of it yet . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seven ` ` i ' m so happy there ' s another girl working here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance says , sw ##ive ##ling around on her desk chair . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s my new cubic ##le mate , and one of only a handful of other intern ##s at thorn ##hill and co . ` ` ah , there . [SEP]
[CLS] my outlook is finally working , ' ' i announce , opening the email system on my desktop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so they ' ll want you to sign an n ##da and stuff , but after , want to go to lunch ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s an n ##da ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to face her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` non - disclosure agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a ton of senators and big business types who come in here , and you ca n ' t tell anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] very important , ' ' she says in hushed tones . [SEP]
[CLS] she seems very pleased that she ' s s ##na ##gged this coveted internship , which is probably why i have n ' t told her that i ' m the boss ' s step ##da ##ught ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never benefited from ne ##pot ##ism before , and it feels strange and uncomfortable to me now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] well i ' d love to get lunch later this week , but i ' m having lunch with my friend allison today . [SEP]
[CLS] we go to uv ##a together , and she ' s got an internship at this urban planning place in georgetown , so i ' m going to meet up with her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cool . [SEP]
[CLS] georgetown has really good shopping . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d love to go with you sometime . [SEP]
[CLS] fashion is like , my side hobby , and you have a st ##yl ##ist ' s dream body . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i - ' ' i begin my canned response to a shopping invitation before i realize that maybe i can afford it . [SEP]
[CLS] and constance looks so perfectly chi ##c in her patterned card ##igan and statement necklace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , that would be wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] i really do n ' t know what to buy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i can help you with that . [SEP]
[CLS] but careful not to wear anything too tight around mr . thorn ##hill , ' ' she adds , rolling her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask with a frown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , who is that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance asks , breaking away from our conversation to stand and peer over our cubic ##le wall . [SEP]
[CLS] i join her to see nate and pierce walking down the hallway together toward the elevator bank . [SEP]
[CLS] they must be having lunch together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s his son , ' ' i reply , immediately sitting down again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he looks like a polo model ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance ex ##claim ##s , sitting back down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , what were you saying about pierce - mr . thorn ##hill - just then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' ve never had an issue , but maybe he ' s just not into asian girls , ' ' she says , throwing her black hair over her shoulder careless ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from what i ' ve heard , though , he has a certain reputation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , no , ' ' i reply , worried ##ly tugging on my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew he was too good to be true . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry . [SEP]
[CLS] from what i ' ve heard , he ' s pretty harmless , he ' s just from a different generation when it comes to women around the office - especially young women , ' ' she adds . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm ##hm , ' ' i reply , my mind already spiral ##ing into crisis mode . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ok , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe he ' s changed , though . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , he ' s married now , ' ' i say , clinging to a spec ##k of hope . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i heard he got married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could be . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think it ' s something that ' s been really recent or anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , feeling slightly mo ##lli ##fied . [SEP]
[CLS] we both spin back to our computers as we hear footsteps approaching our cubic ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up to see pierce and nate appear in the opening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , this is going to sound awful , ' ' pierce begins , and i brace myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but nate and i had plans to go to lunch , and we got down to the lobby before i realized how rude it was not to invite you along . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ew . [SEP]
[CLS] for a second i thought he overheard our conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , that ' s so nice , but i actually have lunch plans with my best friend from school , anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh i see . . . well , enjoy ! [SEP]
[CLS] there are some great restaurants around here . [SEP]
[CLS] we just wanted to let you know you were invited , ' ' pierce says kindly , though from nate ' s frown i ' m guessing that it was more his idea than his son ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` constance , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , turning to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that ' s right , ' ' she squeak ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` alright , well , we better get going or we ' ll be late for our reservation . [SEP]
[CLS] see you at home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce says with a wave , and walks off with nate in tow . [SEP]
[CLS] huh . [SEP]
[CLS] i notice that nate did n ' t say a single word to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess he does n ' t like being the one left wanting for once . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why will mr . thorn ##hill see you at home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance says , slowly turning her desk chair to face me , a weird expression on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , i ' m his step ##da ##ught ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] he just married my mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance gasps and bu ##ries her face in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , oh my god , i ' m so fired . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m fired , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] no ! [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have that kind of authority , i ' m just an intern , like you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the boss ' s daughter , and i was just gossip ##ing about him ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` step - daughter , and i get it . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' d heard rumors like that , i might want to warn other women i work with , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do n ' t even know if they ' re true , i ' m so sorry , ' ' she says mis ##era ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , it ' s ok . and i ' m sorry that i did n ' t tell you earlier that i ' m his step ##da ##ught ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] i just . . . you know , did n ' t want it to seem like it was the only reason i got the internship . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i really do work very hard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you do ! [SEP]
[CLS] of course . [SEP]
[CLS] yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i should get back to work , ' ' constance says , turning to her computer and beginning to type rapidly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` . . . and now i ' m worried she ' s going to keep acting really weird around me , ' ' i con ##fide to allison over a caesar salad at clyde ' s on m street . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think it ' s true ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispers , leaning over the table between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know . . . i mean , maybe he was just a flirt , and it got blown out of proportion , you know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bet that ' s what it is , ' ' allison says , nodding her head sage ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who knows how stories like that really get started ? [SEP]
[CLS] and once they ' re out there , you ca n ' t erase them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope that ' s what it is . . . i do n ' t want to discount some woman ' s , or women ' s , experience just because it would be inc ##on ##ven ##ient for me , though , and painful for my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] she would be so crushed if it were true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would n ' t worry about it . [SEP]
[CLS] and that girl said they were old stories , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you said he treats your mom well , so i bet they ' re just ugly rumors . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , yeah , ' ' i reply , pushing the thought of pierce ' s alleged mis ##be ##ha ##vio ##r to the back of my brain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s the place you ' re staying at george washington ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , knowing she ' s taking advantage of a program at the nearby university to give summer intern ##s a low - cost place to stay in an otherwise expensive city . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] my roommate ' s kinda loud , though . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s your new house ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so big ! [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know why anyone would need that much space . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean before my mom and i got there , it was just for two people . [SEP]
[CLS] well , three , including the maid . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s a maid ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there was . [SEP]
[CLS] she does n ' t live there anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , and there ' s all this flags ##tone on it , so i thought it was old , but my mom said that pierce had the house built around fifteen years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] he must have spent a lot of money to make something so new look worn - in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re lucky , ' ' allison says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s the step ##bro ##ther ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i could live with a dumb jock . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , nate ' s not dumb . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been in a few classes with him , and he ' s really smart . [SEP]
[CLS] he was even wait ##list ##ed for a lawn room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a little defensive of him , ' ' allison observes , sipping her water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i guess so . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know why though . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s been playing these weird mind games with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mind games ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she repeats , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] i push a cr ##out ##on around my plate as i think about how much to tell her . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a feeling it ' s not the kind of situation she ' d condo ##ne , but i also really want to talk to someone about what ' s been going on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you remember that i used to have a crush on him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i remember you saying something about it sophomore year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i still have a crush on him . [SEP]
[CLS] or i think i do . . . i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m definitely attracted to him , and he ' s aware of the fact . [SEP]
[CLS] he can be really rude , and then last night , he almost kissed me , but he . . . ' ' ` ` whoa , what ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , bryn ##n , he ' s your step ##bro ##ther . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know ! [SEP]
[CLS] but only for the last few weeks , and - ' ' ` ` ok . . . but what if you did kiss ? [SEP]
[CLS] what then ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d have to see him every day , because your mom and his dad are married . [SEP]
[CLS] and then even if you were n ' t living together , what about holidays ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d be cutting the thanksgiving turkey and sitting across from the guy you ' d made out with . . . for every thanksgiving . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u ##gh , you ' re right , ' ' i reply , dropping my fork and covering my face with my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] this is why i did n ' t want to tell allison - she ' d throw logic in the face of my hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] but the truth is , she ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like a bucket of cold water has just been poured over my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re right , ' ' i repeat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe i even let it get this far . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i head back to the office after lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting in an awkward silence with constance . [SEP]
[CLS] i try to get her to engage about online shopping , but she only offers me one - word responses . [SEP]
[CLS] later in the day i meet another intern named greg , a cute , strawberry - blonde guy who blush ##es when i look him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] he is more the kind of person i should be looking to date . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wish i felt that same rush that i do whenever i ' m around nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i drive home just after six in the old audi that was just sitting in the thorn ##hill ' s garage . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s definitely the most expensive car i ' ve ever driven , and it ' s fun to really let out the engine on the short stretch of the belt ##way on my way back to potomac . [SEP]
[CLS] i park in the garage and let myself in to the small ant ##ero ##om off the kitchen , where i kick off my shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call out , before spotting her outside on the back lawn , talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] i head upstairs with my to ##te bag still over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] the huge house is silent as i walk up the steps and down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] nate must still be at his internship . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom told me he got one at some think tank downtown . [SEP]
[CLS] i drop my bag as i walk into my bedroom and push the door almost closed behind me with my foot . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t wait to get this skirt off . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s my one pencil skirt , and it ' s a little it ##chy around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] i step into the bathroom and turn on the elegant fa ##uce ##t in the sink . [SEP]
[CLS] i tie my hair behind my head with a loose elastic and splash some cool water on my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] first days are always exhaust ##ing , but i think today was unusually so . [SEP]
[CLS] as i look back up to my reflection , dripping with water , i see something move in the mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at it blankly , not understanding what i ' m seeing . [SEP]
[CLS] the mirror above the sink is reflecting the mirror above my vanity in the bedroom , which is in turn reflecting an image from my partially open bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s nate , i realize . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s standing outside my door , and he does n ' t realize i can see him . [SEP]
[CLS] i look down at the sink , pretending to watch the last of the water as it swirl ##s down the drain . [SEP]
[CLS] a shiver of excitement runs through me at the idea that nate could actually be interested in me - i mean , he ' s there , right now , watching me . [SEP]
[CLS] before i process what i ' m doing , before i can think of all the reasons not to , i slowly move my hands to my lower back and undo the clasp at the top of the zipper , then un ##zi ##p my skirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i let it fall in a pile at my feet , then step out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] i look up carefully and nate is still there in the double reflection . [SEP]
[CLS] allison ' s warning echoes through my mind but i keep going . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel high , high on the feeling that i ' m actually desired . [SEP]
[CLS] i catch hold of the back of my rather shape ##less blouse in my hands and pull it up over my head , then toss it onto the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] as i look back in the mirror , i try to imagine what someone else might see when they look at me , without my constant negative interior mono ##logue telling me nasty things about myself . [SEP]
[CLS] do i have the kind of body that someone like nate could find attractive ? [SEP]
[CLS] now down to my bra and underwear , i begin to feel nervous , but i reach up to un ##cl ##as ##p my bra . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the straps loosen on my shoulders and bring my hands forward to catch it as it falls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ? [SEP]
[CLS] you home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear my mom call from the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] i freeze , holding the bra against my breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up . [SEP]
[CLS] nate is gone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yu ##p , i ' m home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i yell back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i saw your shoes ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m coming up - i want to hear all about your first day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear her footsteps on the staircase and hurriedly ref ##ast ##en my bra . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing like your mom ' s voice to kill your li ##bid ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eight the next couple weeks of my new life seem to pass rather quickly , mostly due to the fact that nate is always out with his friends after work , and our run - ins have been few and far between . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve settled into a routine of sorts , even if i still do n ' t feel like i ' m at home here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d gone to bed early last night , with the intention of sleeping in this morning before visiting museums with allison later in the day . [SEP]
[CLS] however a loud noise from downstairs awake ##ns me - i stare b ##lea ##ry eyed at my alarm clock , it ' s only 6 : 15 ##am . [SEP]
[CLS] who ' d be awake this early on a saturday morning ? [SEP]
[CLS] i get out of bed and tip ##to ##e to my door . [SEP]
[CLS] i open it a little and hear something shuffling around downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i tip ##to ##e out into the hallway and see everyone ' s bedroom doors are closed . [SEP]
[CLS] i know there ' s an alarm system - i had to memo ##rize the pass ##code . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe an un ##gai ##nl ##y mouse is exploring ? [SEP]
[CLS] i creep down the staircase and through the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] the noises sounded like they were coming from the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] the swinging door is open , and i peak my head around it , my heartbeat blasting in my ears . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly , nate steps out in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##claim ##s , and i jump back , startled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , god , i thought you were a bu ##rg ##lar . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you should have called 911 , ' ' he re ##tort ##s br ##us ##quel ##y , turning his back to me and walking to the island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you should be glad i did n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ##esh , does he have to find something wrong with everything i say ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing up so early anyway ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was just working out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow . [SEP]
[CLS] this early ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , moving around him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s fi ##ddling with something in front of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , every morning . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to stay in shape during the off - season . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d be exhausted if - ' ' i break off , as i see blood dripping from his palms onto the granite counter ##top . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , you ' re bleeding ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i just ca n ' t get this fucking tape to . . . ' ' he struggles to wind a bandage around his palm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me , ' ' i say , spying a first aid kit on the counter by the window . [SEP]
[CLS] from the blood smeared on it , i can see nate ' s already gone through it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to , ' ' he protests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come over here . [SEP]
[CLS] the light ' s better , ' ' i ins ##truct him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know what you ' re doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , less than thrilled to accept my help . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more than you , ' ' i reply with a smile , nodding at the mess of tape around his palm . [SEP]
[CLS] i wash my hands in the sink and then open up the kit . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a pair of surgical scissors and cut off the tape that he ' s already applied . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up slightly , and for the first time it hits me that he ' s shirt ##less , wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s covered in sweat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' d this happen ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i over - trained a little . [SEP]
[CLS] got dizzy , tripped on a rock and held out my hands to break my fall , ' ' he replies , eyes down ##cast as he watches me work . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` over - training for what ? [SEP]
[CLS] lacrosse or crew ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask as i pull out a piece of ga ##uze and a bottle of hydrogen per ##oxide . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` both . [SEP]
[CLS] either , ' ' he murmurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is going to sting , ' ' i warn him , as i pat the gas ##hes on his hands with the soaked ga ##uze . [SEP]
[CLS] he hiss ##es slightly as the liquid sting ##s him , but does n ' t move . [SEP]
[CLS] i slide my other hand under his , to stabilize it as i clean ##se the wound of dirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never touched him this long before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` other hand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he switches hands and i go to work cleaning the other one . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe you should take a little time off from training , ' ' i suggest quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or i could just work out my leg muscles , ' ' he says , and i look up to see a wry grin on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' i murmur , smiling too . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , ' ' i go on , a bit more brave ##ly , ` ` i heard that only one varsity athlete got a lawn room , because sports are such a time commitment , much less a two - sport athlete - ' ' ` ` do n ' t do that , ' ' he grunt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want your pity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not pity , it ' s facts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was born with everything , i have no excuse for not achieving my all of goals . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where did you hear that ? [SEP]
[CLS] it sounds like - ' ' i break off , feeling him stiff ##en under my touch . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to say his father but i can tell he does n ' t want me to go there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re just really hard on yourself , that ' s all , ' ' i say instead . [SEP]
[CLS] i gently da ##b some neo ##sp ##orin onto the cuts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know what everyone sees when they look at me , ' ' he replies quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` entitled . . . born with a silver spoon in my mouth . . . i work as hard as i do so that no one can say i succeed because of my family ' s wealth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i frown . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s half of the equation i think , but it seems like he does n ' t see how hard his father pushes him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i got a little bit of that at work the other day , ' ' i say , wondering if it ' s ok to bro ##ach the topic of the internship he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a dry piece of ga ##uze and cover his palm with it before picking up the tape and beginning to wrap it around his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when they found out i was pierce ' s step ##da ##ught ##er , i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] feels weird . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your first experience of ne ##pot ##ism ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , ' ' i say with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , my mom once got me a part - time job as the receptionist at the salon where she used to work , so i guess that ' s not true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where does your dad work ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] probably a repair shop somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a mechanic , or he was . [SEP]
[CLS] last time we heard from him was several years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in florida then , but he never stays in one place very long . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re the first in your family to go to college , ' ' he observes , as i finish tap ##ing one hand and move to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that why you ' re so serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , my eyes moving up to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` serious is n ' t the right word . . . distant , maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` distant ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s worse , ' ' i reply , feeling a little hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t mean to insult you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just trying to figure you out . [SEP]
[CLS] we were really in class together ? [SEP]
[CLS] which one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there were three . [SEP]
[CLS] the first was this american history survey class freshman year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` professor michaels ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i always sat behind you , though . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not surprised you did n ' t see me , ' ' i say , pressing down slightly as i finish wrapping his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up sharply , but his eyes are n ' t focused on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re looking at my body , which i now realize is quite exposed in my thin , white cotton night ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] i completely forgot i was wearing it . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a moment of silence , and i suddenly become very aware of every inch of myself , and every inch of him . [SEP]
[CLS] his smell of sweat , beads of it still dripping forward down his chest , through a sm ##atter ##ing of hair between his nipples . [SEP]
[CLS] allison ' s face appears in my mind , and i ' m reminded of what she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , his eyes pulling up to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` with your hands . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grab a glass from the cabinet and pour him some water from the fa ##uce ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , you felt dizzy because you ' re de ##hy ##dra ##ted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] he reaches for the glass with his left hand , which is closer , and then pauses and takes it awkwardly with his right . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what was that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me see your left arm , ' ' i reply , reaching for him , but he pulls back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no , it ' s nothing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just a little tend ##oni ##tis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh really ? [SEP]
[CLS] did a doctor tell you that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` web ##md ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , raising my eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugs , then wince ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need to take better care of yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t keep pushing yourself so hard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he frowns , and does n ' t respond . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , at least take some ty ##len ##ol for the pain , ' ' i add as i pour two pills into my hand and begin to rep ##ack the first aid kit with the other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s ok . ' ' i tilt my head at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pain is n ' t going to make you heal any faster , ' ' i point out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' he says with a little smile . [SEP]
[CLS] i blush as his fingertips scrape my palm as he takes the pills . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i ' m going back to bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m supposed to check out some of the smithsonian museums later , so . . . ' ' i trail off , feeling awkward now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , see you later , ' ' he says , turning toward the back door . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause for a moment , then head back toward the staircase . [SEP]
[CLS] just like that , the one real conversation that my step ##bro ##ther and i have ever had is over . [SEP]
[CLS] i could practically feel him closing back up at the end there . [SEP]
[CLS] i climb the steps and shut my bedroom door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t think it could get any weird ##er after that pee ##p show i gave him , but somehow this candi ##d glimpse of him makes things even more complicated . [SEP]
[CLS] i close my eyes and try to fall back to sleep , but when my alarm goes off at ten , i ' m still wide awake . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter nine the humidity is really starting to thick ##en by the middle of june , and it ' s a wonder that i have n ' t taken advantage of our pool yet . [SEP]
[CLS] the only swim ##suit i have is an old athletic one - piece , and i pull it on reluctantly in my bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom keeps asking me if i want to go shopping , but i have n ' t taken her up on it yet . [SEP]
[CLS] all her new clothes look wonderful but i think i ' d feel uncomfortable spending so much money on myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i head down the hallway and almost bump into nate as he leaves his bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i reflex ##ively cross my hands over my chest , even though i know he ' s seen me in less . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' i say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the same conversation we ' ve had ever since i saw him in the kitchen that morning . [SEP]
[CLS] we quickly slipped into polite , but formal , interactions with each other afterward . [SEP]
[CLS] if i had to choose between this and the mind games we started out with , i might choose the mind games . [SEP]
[CLS] the doorbell rings and i start to move past him to answer it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok i ' ll get it . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s my friend jackson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walks down the hallway toward the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i follow after him , and turn toward the backyard once we ' re in the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear his friend walk in just as i exit the french doors . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a chest set against the house with the outdoor towels in it , so i grab one and set it on a chair . [SEP]
[CLS] the area around the pool it is paved with light stones before it turns into grass , and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are carefully set around it . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to the pool and step gingerly onto the first step in the shallow end . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s nice - warm , but still refreshing in the hot summer day . [SEP]
[CLS] i step down the rest of the way until the water circles around my stomach , and then dive forward . [SEP]
[CLS] i swim to the other end , where the water gets darker and deeper , then push off and glide onto my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i open my eyes as i push the water past me with my hands and look up toward the house rising against the sun on my left . [SEP]
[CLS] a flash of movement in the second floor window grabs my attention . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a figure moving there , pulling a curtain aside . [SEP]
[CLS] at first i think it ' s nate - it ' s his room , i think - but then i catch a glimpse of blonde hair . [SEP]
[CLS] must be his friend jackson . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn onto my stomach and dive back under the water . [SEP]
[CLS] i want nate to be the one watching me . [SEP]
[CLS] i was never much into sports , but i ' ve always wondered if i ' d be any good at them . [SEP]
[CLS] i push harder for the last couple laps and finally pull my head up at the shallow end , gasping for breath . [SEP]
[CLS] i take the steps back out of the pool and walk around to my towel and dry off my hair , then dr ##ape it onto the chair and lay down on it . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the suit clinging to my torso , and water sitting in my belly button . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson bounds out of the door , his face spread in a gen ##ial grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , you must be bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m jackson , one of nate ' s oldest friends . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' i say as we shake hands . [SEP]
[CLS] i notice nate la ##gging behind , standing just outside the door and looking reluctant to put another foot toward the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , man , let ' s get in . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been dreaming about this pool for days . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should n ' t bother her , she likes to be alone , ' ' nate says reluctantly . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson pulls off his shirt , and i look down at my inter ##lace ##d fingers in my lap . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s got a great body . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe not as good as nate ' s , but whose is ? [SEP]
[CLS] jackson kicks off his flip - flop ##s and jumps in , his splash narrowly missing me . [SEP]
[CLS] nate slowly walks toward the chair fur ##thest from me , and takes off his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch his back muscles tense as he lifts it off his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate and i grew up playing lacrosse together , ' ' jackson says , swimming to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the deck in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hm ? [SEP]
[CLS] oh , ' ' i reply , as nate dive ##s in the deep end . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you guys go to school together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yu ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] uv ##a - i mean , of course you knew that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which sorority are you in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , pushing his wet hair out of his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s expensive , and i ' m already pretty busy with work . [SEP]
[CLS] um , where do you go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate pops up next to jackson . [SEP]
[CLS] they make quite a pair , nate with his dark eyes and jackson with his light blonde locks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wan na get some food now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dude we just got here . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` before , ' ' nate and i both chi ##me in . [SEP]
[CLS] we glance at each other as he continues . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not supposed to eat for thirty minutes before . [SEP]
[CLS] why would n ' t it be ok to eat after you swim ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i dunn ##o , ' ' jackson replies , flashing me a blinding ##ly white smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just thought that was the rule . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i find myself smiling back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he has a boy ##ish charm that ' s infectious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty sure that ' s a myth adults made up so they ' d have time to eat their own lunch without the kids swimming un ##su ##per ##vis ##ed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah that makes more sense . [SEP]
[CLS] you grow up around here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , on the eastern shore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sweet . [SEP]
[CLS] my family has a vacation house there . [SEP]
[CLS] i love going out there . [SEP]
[CLS] sailing in the bay and everything . [SEP]
[CLS] you go sailing a lot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , not really , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] nate kicks off the wall and begins to swim back and forth behind jackson . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess he ' s decided not to take it easy on his injured shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should go some time . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe not with him , ' ' he replies , nodding behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` too competitive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he is , is n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it feels nice to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him . [SEP]
[CLS] and who will gossip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was he always like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh man , always . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re like , ten years old , playing lacrosse on our school team , and coach was constantly having to pull him back during practice ' cause he was always going full out , full contact . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he and i laugh together . [SEP]
[CLS] i notice nate pause in his stroke , but i ca n ' t imagine he can hear us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you still play lacrosse ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` na ##w , i do n ' t really have the discipline to keep up with it . [SEP]
[CLS] i was good in high school , but you have to be great to cut it in college . [SEP]
[CLS] what sport do you play ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , none . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] you look like you ' re so in shape . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , thanks , ' ' i reply , managing to only blush a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] from anyone else it would have seemed like a ham - fisted compliment , but jackson has such a natural , easy ##going way about him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you going to this party in georgetown tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , dun ##king his head briefly underneath the water , then shaking off his hair like a dog . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what party ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i figured nate told you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` told her what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks , appearing next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ' bout chris ' s party , ' ' jackson replies non ##chal ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s jaw muscles twitch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` had n ' t mentioned it , ' ' he replies shortly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you should come , ' ' jackson says , turning back to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s not going to know anyone , and i think it ' s just go ##n na be a small thing , ' ' nate says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dude , chris said to invite anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve got the whole town ##house . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s go ##n na be great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just - ' ' nate begins , as i bite my lip . [SEP]
[CLS] here i thought we were maybe getting along better , despite the awkward ##ness , and now he ' s going out of his way to exclude me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re worried about being a third wheel , just invite dana or someone , ' ' jackson says , though even when he ' s arguing , he does n ' t seem to have a care in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds great , actually , ' ' i say , glancing at nate , feeling a bit gr ##ati ##fied as he glare ##s at me . [SEP]
[CLS] it feels good to spite him a little , since he so clearly does n ' t want me to go . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` awesome . [SEP]
[CLS] tonight then . [SEP]
[CLS] we can go together - i ' ll pick you guys up around ten , ' ' jackson says , before jumping on top of nate and trying to wrestle him under the water . [SEP]
[CLS] i close my eyes as they disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time in a while , i wish i had something cute to wear . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter ten in the end , i have to go with the same black top i wore to that crew party . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s really my only top suitable for a party , i think . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , nate ' s the only one who ' s seen me in it , and i doubt he remembers . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom excitedly waves goodbye as nate and i walk out to jackson ' s green suv . [SEP]
[CLS] she is so thrilled that i might have a social life that it ' s embarrassing . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate slides in back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we picking up dana ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jackson asks as we pull away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s natasha tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' s meeting us there , ' ' nate answers from the back seat . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i ' m relieved , because i do n ' t think i could look dana in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , fuck , natasha , of course , ' ' jackson says , laughing and hitting the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] i frown a little . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess it ' s par for the course for my step ##bro ##ther . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson picks up most of the slack in the conversation , and the radio does the rest . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m too nervous and stuck in my head , thinking of what i should say , while nate mum ##bles one word responses from the back . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m relieved when we find a parking space on the street near the party . [SEP]
[CLS] as we walk toward the riot ##ous town ##house , i ' m surprised the neighbors have n ' t already called the cops . [SEP]
[CLS] people are spilling out the front door and i can hear the music halfway down the block . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a pretty olive - skinned girl standing on the curb who turns her head as nate calls out , ` ` natasha ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiles co ##yl ##y as we walk up . [SEP]
[CLS] nate dip ##s her in a joking ##ly romantic manner and plants a kiss on her lips as she breaks out into giggles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' jackson says , dr ##ap ##ing an arm around my shoulders protective ##ly and escorting me inside . [SEP]
[CLS] he high - five ##s a few guys as we walk in , and he guides me to a ke ##g in the middle of the living room , which is strung with little white christmas lights . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s an imp ##ene ##tra ##ble crowd around it but somehow he manages to s ##na ##g me a beer , and before i know it i ' m taking my first sip of the summer . [SEP]
[CLS] with his hand on the small of my back , we walk into the next room . [SEP]
[CLS] the dining room table is being used for a beer po ##ng game , and jackson and i take a seat on a couch nearby . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re gorgeous , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jackson whispers in my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m startled and almost spit out my beer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . . . ' ' i look down , blushing , ` ` i mean , that ' s sweet of you to say . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d love to see you again after tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe we could get dinner next weekend , ' ' he offers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sure , ' ' i reply , feeling flat ##tered . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , it does feel a little . . . rushed , or something , but i ' ve heard so many stories about guys just wanting to hook up , that it ' s refreshing to be asked out on an old - fashioned date . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a few more sip ##s of my beer as i look around , feeling more comfortable now that i know jackson is really into me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , i ' m going to get another beer , ' ' i tell jackson , as i drain mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he jumps up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry about it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll grab ' em , ' ' he says , walking confidently into the other room . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch the ping po ##ng ball as it ' s thrown back and forth across the table , and jackson is soon back with the beers . [SEP]
[CLS] he launches into a story about this crazy party he went to back at school , but out of the corner of my eye i notice a couple walking up the stairs at the rear of the room , their hands all over each other , and feel a stab of envy in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i am beyond tired of being a virgin . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s certainly not on purpose that i ' m twenty - one and still have n ' t had sex yet . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i just assumed it would happen somehow , without my ever putting any thought into it , and i ' ve never built it up like it ' s going to be some crazy special thing , either . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at jackson out of the corner of my eye as i make quick work of my second beer . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe nate was right - maybe i am too serious and distant . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it would be better if i just got it out of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] and i bet jackson would be good at it . [SEP]
[CLS] really , really good at it . [SEP]
[CLS] plus , he ' s a decent guy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` . . . do n ' t you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jackson asks me , leaning in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , right , ' ' i reply , even though i spaced out and have no idea what he was talking about . [SEP]
[CLS] my hair falls in front of my face as i take another sip of beer , and jackson reaches up and tuck ##s it behind my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] we make eye contact and he leans forward slowly , brushing a soft kiss across my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want to get out of here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he murmurs into my ear , sending a little shiver down my spine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my place is pretty close by , and we ' ll actually be able to hear ourselves think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yeah , that sounds good , ' ' i reply , a little nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson stands and offers me his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i place mine in his and he leads me out toward the front . [SEP]
[CLS] we pass nate on the way , with his arms wrapped around natasha and his hands tucked into her back pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey man , we ' re taking off . [SEP]
[CLS] you think you can find another ride ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jackson asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re both leaving ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yu ##p , we ' re going back to my place , dude , ' ' jackson replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you cool for a ride ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , come here for a second , ' ' nate says , his eyes flicking back and forth between us . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes jackson ' s arm and pulls him toward a screen door in the back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not you , ' ' he says to me , as i begin to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] i br ##istle at his tone . [SEP]
[CLS] they disappear out back and i look after them , my mouth open in shock and annoyance . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe the way nate talks to me sometimes . [SEP]
[CLS] so dismiss ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] i exchange a polite smile with natasha , who is now looking around the party aim ##lessly , clearly bored without nate . [SEP]
[CLS] screw nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll do whatever the hell i please , and i want to know what he ' s saying . [SEP]
[CLS] i brush past natasha , push open the screen door and walk into the small , fence ##d - in backyard . [SEP]
[CLS] there are fewer people out here , but there ' s still a crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just see nate and jackson talking in a back corner . [SEP]
[CLS] i weave my way through the people , keeping my head down so they do n ' t notice me . [SEP]
[CLS] i take out my phone so i look like i ' m doing something other than ea ##ves ##drop ##ping , and sid ##le into the group nearest to them . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just over ##hear what they ' re saying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why , do you want her nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jackson asks angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes widen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck no , she ' s my steps ##ister . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just weird , that ' s all . [SEP]
[CLS] you two . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s not your type . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a stab of pain at the final ##ity of nate ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s gorgeous , ' ' i hear jackson reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think she ' s gorgeous ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate says , beginning to laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? [SEP]
[CLS] dude , come on . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she ' s a fucking buzz kill . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to hear any more . [SEP]
[CLS] i can already feel angry tears building up behind my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so stupid . [SEP]
[CLS] why do i keep giving nate the benefit of the doubt , when he is so clearly such an asshole ? [SEP]
[CLS] i walk quickly back inside , through the living room , and out to the street . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn toward the left , where i can see a bus ##ier street , and hu ##stle toward it . [SEP]
[CLS] i know it ' s going to be a price ##y cab ride back to the house , but i feel like i ' m about to explode into a puddle of tears . [SEP]
[CLS] and i do n ' t want to give nate the satisfaction of seeing me cry . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eleven i breathe in as deeply as possible and hold it , counting to ten before ex ##haling as slowly as i can , trying to rid myself of the hurt feeling that followed me home from the party . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a trick i learned to control my anxiety , and to say that i ' m anxious right now would be an under ##sta ##tem ##ent . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t remember the last time i heard someone talk about me like that , though i suppose it ' s partially my fault for ea ##ves ##drop ##ping . [SEP]
[CLS] i finally start to feel calm enough to go to sleep , and reach to turn off my bedside lamp . [SEP]
[CLS] a rush of footsteps up the stairs makes me pause . [SEP]
[CLS] i sit up a bit as they continue down the hallway toward my bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] a second later , my bedroom door bursts open and nate walks in , his face dark with anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re in bed ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve got ta be fucking kidding me . [SEP]
[CLS] that was really selfish of you to run off without telling anyone , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he spit ##s at me , then turns around and walks out . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m frozen in shock for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell was that ? [SEP]
[CLS] what does he have to be mad at me for ? [SEP]
[CLS] i leap out from under my covers and march out of my bedroom just in time to stop him from shutting his door . [SEP]
[CLS] he swings around as i charge into his room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m selfish ? [SEP]
[CLS] you are just . . . you are just . . . ' ' i stumble in my anger , trying to think of the right word . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , you ' re selfish , bryn ##n ! [SEP]
[CLS] i looked around that party for you for thirty minutes ! [SEP]
[CLS] i thought you might have been kidnapped ! [SEP]
[CLS] i almost called the cops ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait . . . what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , completely thrown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ever heard of a text message ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his voice laden with sarcasm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i ' ve heard of a text message ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] man , i wish i were better at arguing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , wait a second , this is n ' t about me , this is about you ! [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re the asshole ! [SEP]
[CLS] i heard what you were saying about me to jackson , i ' m not a buzz ##kill , and maybe i ' m not gorgeous , but i ' m not some kind of joke , either ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i fight back the tears well ##ing in my eyes , more angry than i ' ve ever been in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] there , that got him . [SEP]
[CLS] he stands dumb ##founded and i seize the opportunity to walk out . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i ' m about to cross the threshold , he reaches around me and closes the door in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i stop short and turn around angrily , almost ready to smack him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s standing so close to me i ' m practically pinned against the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , what ? [SEP]
[CLS] how ' d you hear that ? [SEP]
[CLS] you followed us outside ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i followed you , ' ' i reply , stumbling a bit because i know i was wrong in that regard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was mad because you were obviously trying to stop me from leaving with jackson , and i wanted to know why . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i ca n ' t control what you think about me , and that ' s . . . whatever , that ' s fine , but i do n ' t know why you had to go sharing your opinion with jackson . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , am i really that una ##tt ##ractive to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] to my horror , my lower lip starts to tremble . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to cry right now but i ca n ' t hold back the tears any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . . . shit , that ' s not what . . . ' ' nate says , his eyes widen as a tear slips down my cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] i furiously brush it away and nate backs up , running his hands through his wavy hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not that i do n ' t want jackson to date you , it ' s that i do n ' t want you to date jackson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] that does n ' t make any sense , ' ' i reply , trying to staunch the flow of tears as i tug at my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jackson ' s track record with women is pretty bad . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re just conquest ##s to him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cross my arms and frown at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds pretty h ##yp ##oc ##rit ##ical . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , the first time we met , you asked me to have a three ##some with you and you did n ' t even know my name . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a smile tugs at the corner of his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , that ' s fair . [SEP]
[CLS] for the record , you just looked so shocked , and innocent - i could n ' t resist . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re right , it ' s not like i have a great track record either . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess the difference , in my mind , is that i ' m up ##front about it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never promised a woman a relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] the girls i sleep with , they know that it ' s not going anywhere because i tell them that . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson pulls them in by promising them a future with him , and then as soon as he sleeps with them , he acts like they do n ' t exist . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' re friends with him . . . ' ' i point out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , he ' s a good friend . [SEP]
[CLS] loyal , funny . . . ' ' ` ` but he sounds like a bad person . [SEP]
[CLS] i just . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know why you ' d want to be friends with a person like that . [SEP]
[CLS] sorry , maybe i ' m just . . . ' ' i shake my head , trying to process this new version of events . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he did . . . what you just said about him does match up with some things he was saying to me . [SEP]
[CLS] god , i ca n ' t believe i fell for it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he was n ' t always like that , ' ' nate says quietly , gesturing vaguely to a framed photo sitting on his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at it , then walk over to get a closer look . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , is that you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , picking it up . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a class photo from elementary school , three rows of smiling kids with their teacher standing next to them . [SEP]
[CLS] nate is easy to spot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look so serious , like you ' re on the way to the office or something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate peers over my shoulder at it , his face an exact reflection of his younger self . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was the year my mom left , ' ' he says quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] do you ever see her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] she made her choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that one ' s jackson , ' ' he says , pointing out a grinning tow ##head ##ed boy . [SEP]
[CLS] i snort . [SEP]
[CLS] he had a flirt ##ati ##ous smile even back then . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry you heard me say those things . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson ' s the kind of guy who , if you tell him something ' s off limits , that makes him want it even more . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s never been denied anything . [SEP]
[CLS] so i thought it would be better to convince him that he did n ' t want you in the first place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i fiddle with the edge of the frame and then turn to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s standing closer than i thought he was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . you do n ' t think those things about me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , feeling suddenly vulnerable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , the exact opposite , really , ' ' he replies , equally softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n you are gorgeous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a charged moment between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t rip my gaze away from his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] i realize he ' s moving forward ever so slowly , and my lips automatically part , my body taking over from my brain . [SEP]
[CLS] every inch of my skin tingle ##s , and i suddenly feel brave - a completely different reaction than anything i ' ve ever felt being this close to jackson . [SEP]
[CLS] just before his mouth touches mine , i close my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] as our lips come together , an exquisite feeling rushes through me , unlike anything i ' ve ever felt before . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips graz ##e mine , then return a bit more firmly , guiding me into a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been kissed by a handful of guys over the years , but this kiss is something else . [SEP]
[CLS] nate is something else . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands wrap around my waist and slide to the small of my back as his lips crush against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] all my thoughts eva ##por ##ate , all my worries and ins ##ec ##urities - maybe it ' s that i can tell he knows exactly what he ' s doing , and so i can let myself go , trust myself in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he nu ##dge ##s me slightly with his nose and his lower lip brushes against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost gasp as i feel his tongue move smoothly into my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] electricity flies straight from my mouth to the base of my hips . [SEP]
[CLS] i press my tongue against his as my hands move of their own accord up to his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i lay my palms against his pe ##cs and feel his racing heartbeat under his rapidly rising and falling chest . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s my first hint that there ' s something else hiding under his completely confident exterior . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue moves deeper into my mouth , and his hands pull me close against his body . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my arms around his neck and run my fingers through the hair falling onto the collar of his polo . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his erection pushing against my stomach as he slides one hand over my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] i want nothing more than to rip my clothes off , jump on his bed , and be ravaged by him . . . to feel his mouth all over my body . . . inside me . . . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly he pulls away . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost fall forward in surprise as my eyes blink open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should n ' t have done that , ' ' he mutter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , falling quickly from my cloud . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s wrong . . . you ' re my steps ##ister . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it ' s best if we just keep our distance from each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , you ' re right . . . ' ' i reply , feeling like he ' s just slapped me in the face . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk quickly to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause before i open it , wishing i could put into words what i ' m feeling , but i ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i open the door and close it softly behind me before rushing to my room . [SEP]
[CLS] as i curl up under the covers , i try to wrap my mind around all the twists this night has taken . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe nate and i just kissed . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i ' ve been dreaming about that moment since i first laid eyes on him freshman year . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve found that most things in life do n ' t live up to how i ' ve built them up in my head , but that kiss far surpassed any fantasy . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my body reacting at just the thought of his lips touching mine again . [SEP]
[CLS] but is he right ? [SEP]
[CLS] was it wrong of us to do that ? [SEP]
[CLS] light is creeping around the sides of my shades by the time i manage to fall asleep , and i still have n ' t managed to find an answer . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twelve nate and i pass the next few weeks as though we ' re each surrounded by an invisible force field . [SEP]
[CLS] whenever one of us enters a room , the other is propelled out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re only pushed into close proximity with each other when we have a family dinner , though my mom has been pushing those on us quite frequently in an effort to bond . [SEP]
[CLS] if she only knew . [SEP]
[CLS] today , though , nate ' s and my presence is required at the same event : the thorn ##hill ' s annual fourth of july party . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s in our very own backyard , starting in the afternoon with a crab boil and extending through the evening fireworks . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently we ' ll get a good view of the country club ' s annual fireworks display just down the river . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom has absolutely insisted on buying me a new dress for the occasion , and even came into the fitting room with me to make sure it fit correctly . [SEP]
[CLS] the shift dress is not exactly my style , but i ' ve seen it on plenty of girls at school . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just worried about spilling tar ##tar sauce on the bright white fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull on my new pair of gold wedge ##s , and walk downstairs to see if my mom needs any help . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m taken aback by the flu ##rry of activity downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] as i walk outside , i realize i ' ve under ##est ##imated the scale of this party . [SEP]
[CLS] when i heard ` ` crab boil , ' ' i was pic ##turing a few picnic tables with red and white table ##cloth ##s , but this is clearly a class ##y affair . [SEP]
[CLS] there are elegant round tables set , with flowing linen ##s and extravagant center ##piece ##s on top of them . [SEP]
[CLS] the food is presented in silver tray ##s , and garland ##s fest ##oon the perimeter . [SEP]
[CLS] i spot my mom talking in hushed , urgent tones to one of the cater ##ers , and head over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n , you look beautiful ! [SEP]
[CLS] that dress fits you so well , ' ' she gus ##hes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . . . do you need any help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , no . [SEP]
[CLS] i think we ' re ok . [SEP]
[CLS] the guests should begin arriving in about ten minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , go taste the freedom martini over at the bar and tell me what you think . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m worried it ' s a little too sweet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the freedom martini ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the signature cocktail we created for this event , ' ' the cater ##er next to her chi ##mes in with a chip ##per grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , of course , ' ' i reply , heading for the bar . [SEP]
[CLS] the bartender serves me a pale pink drink and i take a sip . [SEP]
[CLS] not too sweet - it ' s delicious , light and refreshing . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily the day is n ' t too hot , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] the temperature has managed to stay below ninety degrees for the party . [SEP]
[CLS] i decide to go down to the river since i ' d just feel in the way while they ' re setting up . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk down to the lower lawn and down the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] as i reach the shore , i navigate the rocky sand cautiously in my heels . [SEP]
[CLS] a splash on the other side of the large boulder grabs my attention . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk toward it and peer around . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s standing there , skipping rocks with a smooth side ##arm motion . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause , admiring his form , then decide it ' s best to just go back up to the lawn before he notices me . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s made it clear he does n ' t want to talk to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn back and as i walk my heel catches on a rock . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as i slip sideways , and feel two strong hands catching me under my arms to hold me up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , careful , ' ' he says as he straighten ##s me up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' i reply as i turn to him and tuck my hair back behind my ears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you escaping from the commotion , too ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t really enjoy these things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re so . . . ' ' i trail off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] i groan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to say ' charming , ' ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i knew it , ' ' he replies joking ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , whatever charm you might be noticing has been developed over many years of practice . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad has been dragging me to these kinds of events for years . [SEP]
[CLS] i know the routine . [SEP]
[CLS] smile , shake hands , tell the kinds of jokes that do n ' t make anyone think too hard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds . . . horrible . [SEP]
[CLS] but at least there ' s a lot of free food . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he gives me a be ##mus ##ed glance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes i forget i do n ' t have to worry about that stuff anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were , um , not well - off before our parents - ' ' he drops his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d say we were struggling . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was just the way i grew up . [SEP]
[CLS] i never wanted for anything big , though we certainly frequented the goodwill racks often enough . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t want you to think . . . i mean , my mom , she really cares for pierce . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax - i do n ' t think your mom ' s a gold digger . [SEP]
[CLS] there have always been some of those around , and i can practically smell them at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , maybe at first i was worried , but i ' m not now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was your mom - ' ' i begin , feeling brave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t like to talk about her , ' ' he cuts me off , and chuck ##s another rock out onto the water . [SEP]
[CLS] it hits the surface with a pl ##op ##ping sound and sinks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s your shoulder ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hurts , ' ' he replies shortly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you up there , ' ' i say after a moment , since he ' s clearly done with the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' he calls after me as i climb the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jackson and his parents are here . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re family friends . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re on the guest list every year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got it , thanks , ' ' i reply , before mounting the rest of the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] that was consider ##ate of him , and it sounds like he was telling me that he did n ' t invite jackson himself . [SEP]
[CLS] as i walk across the lawn , i can see that the first guests are beginning to arrive . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder if now that i ' m pierce ' s step ##da ##ught ##er , i ' m going be expected to put on the same song - and - dance routine as nate . [SEP]
[CLS] usually if i have to go to a party , like my aunt ' s christmas party , i ' ll hang out for a while , and then disappear somewhere to read a book . [SEP]
[CLS] my fears are realized as my mom waves me over to where she and pierce are standing with two guests . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m introduced to the couple , who turn out to be higher - ups for the state department , and my accomplishments are tr ##otted out while they murmur enthusiastically , though i have to wonder if anyone could possibly be genuinely interested in such self - serving pratt ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] as we talk , my mom breaks away to greet the guests that are now pouring in . [SEP]
[CLS] i listen politely as pierce chat ##s away , impressed with his wit and charm . [SEP]
[CLS] clearly nate gets it from his dad , even if he does insist that it ' s a learned skill . [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to slip away and head over to the buffet table . [SEP]
[CLS] like any good maryland girl , i absolutely love crabs . [SEP]
[CLS] as i pile my plate high , i feel a hand on the small of my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to see jackson grinning at me . [SEP]
[CLS] with his open , friendly face , it ' s hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him , and what i experienced for myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , brushing a kiss against my cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jackson , good to see you , ' ' i reply politely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you disappeared so fast the last time i saw you ! [SEP]
[CLS] i was worried , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about that , ' ' i respond , wondering if nate gave him any explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ever going to go on that date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m saved by the sight of allison walking out onto the deck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could you excuse me for a moment ? [SEP]
[CLS] my best friend just got here and she does n ' t know anyone else , ' ' i explain as i slip away . [SEP]
[CLS] i wave at her as i approach , but she ' s looking around nervously and does n ' t register my presence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` allison ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call out , just ten feet from her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] oh my go ##sh , i did n ' t recognize you , ' ' she says . [SEP]
[CLS] i give her a hug as i walk up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this party is really fancy ! [SEP]
[CLS] and this house ! [SEP]
[CLS] i mean you said it was big , but i did n ' t think it was this big . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' i groan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll give you a tour later if you have a couple hours , ' ' i add wryly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come get something to eat with me - i was just filling up a plate . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so glad you ' re here . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t really know anyone else , and none of the intern ##s have shown up yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the intern ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison asks as we head back over to the buffet , where i pick up my abandoned plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , pierce invited all the intern ##s from the office . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , that was nice of him , ' ' allison comments , picking up her own plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , i think that guy ' s a senator . . . the one in the blue see ##rs ##uck ##er jacket . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from georgia , yeah , ' ' i confirm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think he and pierce served in congress at the same time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i start giggling and allison looks at me with a questioning smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , i just ca n ' t believe i ' m talking about my stepfather serving in congress . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is your real life ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison says , laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when do you think it ' ll sink in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no idea , ' ' i reply as we head toward a couple empty seats at one of the tables . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your mom looks really happy , ' ' allison observes as we sit . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch her for a moment , fl ##itt ##ing between conversations , so beautiful and animated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think she is . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' s just really good at cocktail - type conversation , too . [SEP]
[CLS] like nate , though he says it does n ' t come to him naturally . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n . . . ' ' allison says , raising an eyebrow at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i mean , i ' m just , you know . . . ' ' i reply , trailing off . [SEP]
[CLS] definitely not the time to tell allison that nate and i kissed , though i do n ' t know if that time will ever come . [SEP]
[CLS] i love allison , but thinking in shades of grey is not her strong suit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thought you two could use some drinks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i look up to see greg , the cute intern with the strawberry - blonde hair , standing next to us , three martini glasses carefully balanced between his long fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` greg , hi ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so glad you could make it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i indicate the chair next to us and help him place down the glasses so that they do n ' t spill their contents . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` greg , this is my friend allison . [SEP]
[CLS] we go to college together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice to meet you , ' ' allison says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you too . [SEP]
[CLS] hope these drinks are ok with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i forget what the bartender called them . . . ' ' ` ` freedom martini ##s , ' ' i answer , rolling my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the name sucks , but they ' re really good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so where are you from originally , greg ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` raleigh , though i hope to move to dc after i graduate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tune out slightly as allison and greg talk across me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve just seen nate cross between groups of people , seeming to make conversation effortlessly . [SEP]
[CLS] i look around to see if there ' s a girl trailing him , but i do n ' t see one . [SEP]
[CLS] this might be the first time i ' ve seen him without a date at any kind of gathering . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea that it could be because of me comes to my mind , but i quickly qu ##ash it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let myself think like that . [SEP]
[CLS] nate does n ' t want that kind of relationship with me , probably even if i were n ' t his steps ##ister . [SEP]
[CLS] i bet his date just got a cold last - minute or something . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be right back , ' ' allison says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to get a second helping ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my attention snaps back to greg as she stands and leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] he scratches his cheek and clears his throat . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile as a blush sneak ##s onto his fr ##eck ##le - dotted skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look . . . um , that ' s a nice dress , ' ' he finally says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile , careful not to linger on the subject , ` ` so , you think you ' ll want to work in politics after school ends ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , in government , ' ' he says with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` though i ' m learning that one does n ' t seem to exist without the other . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i need to work on the whole . . . you know . . . ' ' he waves his hand vaguely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` kissing babies thing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly , ' ' he smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , ah , i was wondering . . . ' ' my attention drift ##s from him again as i see my mom and pierce talking urgently by the house . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom covers her face with her hands and pierce turns back to the party , his frown turning into a smile as if by magic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , greg , could you excuse me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think my mom might need me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sure , ' ' he replies kindly as i rush toward the door into the study . [SEP]
[CLS] my mind runs through the possible scenarios as i hurry through the study and up the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] as i climb the second set of stairs up to the master suite on the third floor , i decide it must be my father . [SEP]
[CLS] the last time i saw my mom look that upset , it was because my dad was back in town and press ##uring her for money . [SEP]
[CLS] i knock softly on the closed double door of their bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper quietly as i let myself in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as i hurry in . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s curled up on top of the beds ##pre ##ad , like a broken doll . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s pierce , ' ' she murmurs without moving . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his lawyer just called him . [SEP]
[CLS] a woman has come forward accusing him of sexual harassment . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' ll be on the news tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter thirteen ` ` oh no , ' ' i whisper , sitting next to her on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it . . . is it me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , turning her head as a tear drops down her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe it ' s me . . . maybe it ' s my fault . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like i ' m a curse . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , mom , no , ' ' i whisper , leaning down and pulling her hair out of her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t happening because of you . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , when did this even go on ? [SEP]
[CLS] the , you know , the . . . ' ' i reply , unable to repeat those two ugly words : sexual harassment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` several years ago , ' ' she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` long before he ever met you , ' ' i point out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what ? [SEP]
[CLS] this woman ' s going on tv ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one of those investigation shows is doing a piece about sexual harassment in politics , and she ' s going to be interviewed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we ' ll have to bat ##ten down the hatch ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll probably have to stay in the house for a few days , though luckily tomorrow ' s saturday anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , that ' s not what i meant . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , if pierce sexually harassed a - ' ' ` ` i do n ' t want to think about it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom , you have to , ' ' i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s always been like the child in our relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m tired of the dynamic , but i do n ' t know how to break the pattern without our entire relationship falling apart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if pierce did that , then maybe you have to - ' ' ` ` do n ' t say it . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce and i are staying together . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not a question . [SEP]
[CLS] and even if he did do it , i ' m sure it was a momentary weakness . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just something that happened a long time ago , and he ' s changed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shrug , feeling helpless . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want that to be true , mom , i really do . [SEP]
[CLS] not for his sake , but for yours . [SEP]
[CLS] i did hear a rumor at work , though , ' ' i say he ##sit ##ating ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] what kind of rumor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that . . . pierce has a certain reputation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you tell me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i want to tell her that it ' s because she ' s so fragile , but instead i just reply , ` ` because it was just a rumor that i heard from one person . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no way of knowing if it were true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , until there ' s some evidence or something , i ' m going to believe pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] he said she was a woman at work who was denied a promotion she wanted , and now she ' s starting a jewelry line , and thought she might as well put her bitterness to good use and drum up some publicity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess that could be it , ' ' i say without conviction . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i just want to be alone for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] do you think you could go back to the party , and sort of act like the hostess for me ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know , make sure everyone ' s having a good time and all that ? [SEP]
[CLS] just say i have a headache if anyone asks after me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , alright , ' ' i reply , not knowing what else to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , honey , ' ' my mom says , settling back onto the pillow . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand and head for the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just ca n ' t believe it , ' ' i hear her murmur as i close the bedroom door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i did n ' t believe it either , but there ' s a tell ##tale knot in the pit of my stomach that ' s telling me i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i head back down to the party , taking the stairs slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than plaster ##ing a smile on my face and pretending everything ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] but i know my mom ' s right - it will look odd if both of us disappear during the party . [SEP]
[CLS] i re ##eme ##rge out back and take a deep breath as i cross back over to greg and allison . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about that . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom has a headache , i just wanted to check on her , ' ' i relay du ##ti ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] greg and allison murmur sympathetic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] i finish the rest of my food quickly , and with only one ear on their conversation , before standing up with my drink . [SEP]
[CLS] i excuse myself and begin to ming ##le , trying to ci ##rc ##ulate and play the part of the hostess like my mom asked . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch the fading light impatiently ; willing the sun to set as fast as possible so that this party can finally be over . [SEP]
[CLS] the chip ##per event organizer i met earlier appears quietly at my side as i force a laugh at a party ##go ##er ' s joke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you seen mrs . [SEP]
[CLS] thorn ##hill ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it still throws me to hear my mom referred to like that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s not feeling well . [SEP]
[CLS] can i help you with something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like the lanterns to be lit now , or should we wait ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance around at the dim ##ming light . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now would be fine , thanks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hu ##rries away and i spot nate across the party , frowning at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ave ##rt my gaze quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] if his dad has n ' t told him what ' s going on yet , i do n ' t want the task to fall on me . [SEP]
[CLS] i see him making his way over , and excuse myself from my current conversation to disappear into a large group of people around the pool . [SEP]
[CLS] just another hour or so and the fireworks will be done , and everyone will leave . [SEP]
[CLS] the cater ##ers move throughout the party , lighting candles on the tables and mini chinese lanterns strung in the trees . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white lights , the well - heel ##ed crowd , the murmur of easy conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom does know how to throw a good party . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab another drink as the twilight turns into night and people begin heading down to the lower lawn to get a better view of the fireworks . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sudden boom , the display begins . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a few ex ##cl ##ama ##tions of excitement and some clapping as the crowd gathers to stare down ##river at the explosions of color . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m making my way toward the rear of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i know before i even turn around that it ' s nate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks quietly , as i turn to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom just is n ' t feeling well , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pulling at your hair , ' ' he points out , and i drop my hand , feeling caught . [SEP]
[CLS] the crowd cheers as an especially colorful fire ##work goes off above us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can read you like a book , bryn ##n , ' ' he replies , leaning in . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his breath on my cheek and step back , feeling flu ##stered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just think it ' s something that your dad should tell you , ' ' i say , and turn back to the fireworks , but i feel his hand on my elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you just tell me ? [SEP]
[CLS] you and my dad are both acting strangely , and now your mom disappears . . . i just want to know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here i thought i was covering well , ' ' i say , stall ##ing for time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe to other people , but not to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him for a moment as his features are illuminated by the light of one of my favorite , willow - shaped fireworks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s a woman . . . she ' s going to go on the news tomorrow and say that your dad sexually harassed her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s crazy , ' ' he hiss ##es at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just the messenger - you insisted i tell you - ' ' i st ##am ##mer , taken aback by his tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my dad , he ' s a great man . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a pillar of the community - ' ' ` ` a pillar of the community ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] he is ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just , sometimes the way you talk about him . . . he ' s not perfect , nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know anything about him . [SEP]
[CLS] when my mom abandoned us , he took care of me all by himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s always been there for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , i ' m just - ' ' but nate storms off back to the house . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand in shock for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew that conversation was n ' t going to be fun , but i did n ' t think he ' d turn on me like that , as though i were attacking pierce , or something . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn back toward the crowd just as the finale begins and the sky lights up . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at the people around me , their faces up ##turn ##ed , their expressions joy ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it was silly of me to look forward to everyone leaving . [SEP]
[CLS] because now i realize that tomorrow , it will be back to the four of us alone in the house - and no buffer zone . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes fall on pierce and i realize he ' s staring at me . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles quickly when he realizes that i ' m looking at him , and leads the applause as the last fire ##work dies out . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fourteen i was half - worried that the plan was for all four of us to watch the tv program together , but thankfully there ' s no such expectation . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , i have n ' t been told of it . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the first time in a while my mom has n ' t insisted on a family dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s been hole ##d up in her room most of the day , while pierce fields calls from his attorneys in his study . [SEP]
[CLS] i decide to grab some left ##over pasta from the fridge to eat in my room , and peer into nate ' s room as i pass . [SEP]
[CLS] no sign of him . [SEP]
[CLS] i shut my door behind me and open my computer to check out some of the coverage online . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel na ##use ##ous as i read the woman ' s claims , though slightly relieved that she is n ' t accusing pierce of any kind of violence . [SEP]
[CLS] she talks mostly about lingering touches , shoulder massage ##s , and being stone ##wall ##ed by management when she complained . [SEP]
[CLS] i finish eating and click around the internet for a while , feeling restless . [SEP]
[CLS] when i ca n ' t stand my boredom any longer , i take my plate and walk back down to the kitchen and put it in the dish ##wash ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the phone on the counter rings as i ' m headed past it . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause for a moment , waiting to see if someone else is going to answer it . [SEP]
[CLS] what if it ' s a reporter ? [SEP]
[CLS] do i just say ' no comment , ' like they do on tv ? [SEP]
[CLS] on the third ring , i decide to bite the bullet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , is nate there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a female voice asks breathless ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ah , another admire ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , i do n ' t think he is , ' ' i reply honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i take a message ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a slight pause . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this holly ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , this is her daughter , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] may i ask who ' s calling ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s another long pause , and i begin to feel uneasy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s eileen . . . nate ' s mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i almost drop the phone in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , um , i don ' t - ' ' ` ` wait ! [SEP]
[CLS] please , please do n ' t hang up . [SEP]
[CLS] i just saw the news , and thought that nate might be willing to talk to me now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because he ' ll know the truth about pierce , and then maybe he wo n ' t believe whatever he says about me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i do n ' t think i should be in the middle of this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] whatever it is . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , please . . . ' ' i hear her gasp and the clear sound of crying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have n ' t talked to nate in so long . . . he ' s my son , he ' s my son . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you chose to leave him . . . ' ' ` ` is that what pierce told you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he heard it from pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] i left pierce because he was cheating on me . [SEP]
[CLS] but pierce is used to having everything his own way , and he was furious . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the one with the money , i came into the marriage with nothing , and signed a pre - nu ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i barely even looked at the thing at the time - i thought we ' d be together forever . [SEP]
[CLS] he had an expensive lawyer and managed to get full custody in the divorce . [SEP]
[CLS] i never had a chance . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been trying to get in touch with nate for years to tell him the truth . . . i left pierce , not nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i would never leave my son . [SEP]
[CLS] i never would have divorced pierce , even though he was cheating on me , if i had known i ' d never see my son again . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought after seeing this woman on tv , maybe he ' d believe me . . . ' ' she dissolve ##s into sobs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eileen , eileen , it ' s ok , ' ' i whisper , feeling sick . [SEP]
[CLS] something about what she ' s telling me rings true . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel it in my gut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to help you , but . . . nate , he ' s really touch ##y about his father . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know what i can do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , and i ' m sorry to put this on you . [SEP]
[CLS] i call the house now and then trying to get nate , and i was just hoping that he would pick up tonight and not hang up on me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a sound behind me makes me fly around . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce is standing in the doorway to the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , everything ' s fine , pierce , ' ' i reply so that eileen can hear me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just take down my number , alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] eileen says quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , just tell him what i said . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i write the number down on a small note ##pad on the counter , conscious that pierce is watching me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got it , thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] talk to you later , ' ' i say , and hang up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not a reporter , i hope , ' ' pierce says with a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , just a friend , ' ' i reply as non ##chal ##antly as possible , and rip the paper off the pad and stuff it in my pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , this has been the longest day of my life , ' ' he says with a sigh , running his fingers through his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you and your mom do n ' t get dragged into anything . [SEP]
[CLS] there might be some reporters hanging out by the gate tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] probably best to just avoid them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , no problem . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looks so tired , and i find myself quickly feeling sorry for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he seems so genuine right now that it ' s hard to believe what eileen and this other woman are saying about him . [SEP]
[CLS] the man in front of me paints such a different picture . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` on the other hand , though , i ' m glad that you and your mom are here right now . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it ' s selfish of me . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t think i ' d make it through all this without her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s really brought light back into my life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s . . . yeah , she ' s great , ' ' i reply awkwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you having a good time at the internship ? [SEP]
[CLS] not too much busy work , i hope . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , not at all , pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s wonderful , thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i better get back to work . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d think i ' d have gotten a lot done , considering how long i ' ve been in there , but i ' ve just been staring at the wall . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , well , i ' ll see you tomorrow then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ' night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i walk back upstairs with the phone number burning a hole in my pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s amazing to me that i ' ve gone from being almost sure that pierce is lying , to feeling like i ' ve betrayed his trust in the span of one short conversation with him . [SEP]
[CLS] is he telling the truth , or does he just possess a con ##sum ##mate politician ' s ability to spin the story for himself ? [SEP]
[CLS] i get ready for bed slowly , my mind wandering un ##con ##tro ##lla ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] before this summer , i felt sure of things in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] sure of my ideas and opinions . [SEP]
[CLS] sure that i was right . [SEP]
[CLS] but i feel less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this house . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i finish brushing my teeth , i hear a thud from the hallway , then a groan . [SEP]
[CLS] that sounded like nate . [SEP]
[CLS] with a frown , i open my bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , there ' s nate , lying on the carpet just outside his own room . [SEP]
[CLS] i hesitate , realizing i ' m wearing my little night ##go ##wn , but figure he ' s seen me in it already . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i murmur , hurrying to knee ##l next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] the w ##hiff of alcohol coming off of him gives it away before he says anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so drunk , bryn ##n , ' ' he says , beginning to laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sh ##hh , you ' ll wake up our parents , ' ' i ad ##mon ##ish him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you on the floor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tripped . [SEP]
[CLS] on my own foot , ' ' he replies with a sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , come on , get up , ' ' i order him , sliding a hand under his torso to pull him upward . [SEP]
[CLS] he slowly obey ##s and stands on his feet , where he sway ##s dangerously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , now in here , ' ' i continue , pushing his bedroom door open with my foot as i slide an arm around his back to stabilize him . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his muscles clench under his t - shirt as we walk . [SEP]
[CLS] not the time , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shoes off , ' ' i order him as we reach the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' he grunt ##s , as he kicks them off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m getting you some water . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t move . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry back to my bedroom and grab my water glass from the bedside table , then ref ##ill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room . [SEP]
[CLS] i shut the door behind me to keep the noise from filtering around the house , then stop in surprise as i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is standing at the foot of his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' he sl ##urs , as i hesitantly walk forward and hand him the water . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch him gulp the whole glass down , the grey moonlight from the window illuminating his ripped torso . [SEP]
[CLS] he puts the glass down on his desk and wipe ##s his mouth with the back of his hand as he sway ##s slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never seen you drunk before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t really drink . [SEP]
[CLS] no time . [SEP]
[CLS] work , practice , work , game . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i thought i was the ne ##rd , ' ' i tease him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re funny , ' ' he says , cock ##ing his head slightly , then takes a step toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . ' ' i say as my core clench ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks innocent ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you said this was wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] those were your words , ' ' i remind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think it ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he takes another step toward me , and looks down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i - ' ' his hand reaches around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does it feel wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . . . no , ' ' i breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] i barely have time to in ##hale before his mouth is on mine . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth tastes like whiskey , but i do n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my hands around his neck and he grabs my ass with both hands , our kiss picking up right where our last one broke off . [SEP]
[CLS] i dig my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me roughly against him and groans deep in his throat as our bodies col ##lide . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly he stumble ##s back , steady ##ing himself on my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' he whispers , shaking his head as though to clear it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you just stay with me for a while ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , of course , ' ' i reply immediately , even though i ' m taken aback by his request . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch him turn to his bed and crawl over to his pillow , then curl up on his side and look at me expect ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause , then follow him , crawling across the beds ##pre ##ad and curling around his back . [SEP]
[CLS] i bury my head between his shoulder blades then dr ##ape my arm over his waist , and feel him take my hand in his and pull me closer against him . [SEP]
[CLS] i lie as still as i can , barely breathing . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe he ' s letting me touch him like this . [SEP]
[CLS] well , he is wasted , but still . [SEP]
[CLS] i never thought he ' d be so vulnerable around me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear his breathing deep ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve always looked up to him , ' ' he murmurs , startling me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper back , knowing that he ' s talking about his dad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know what i would do if he - ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i murmur , softly kissing the back of his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] he stills on his pillow , and his breathing slow ##s down again . [SEP]
[CLS] i stay with him for a while , until i know he ' s asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to understand nate ' s feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told me . [SEP]
[CLS] his world is already falling apart around him , and i do n ' t want to make it happen faster . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] i should probably go back to my room . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn over with a sigh and frown . [SEP]
[CLS] my sheets feel different , and the light coming in from the window is much too bright . [SEP]
[CLS] i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a gasp . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m in nate ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok . ' ' i glance up to see nate sitting at his desk with a glass of water , his to ##us ##led hair sticking out at odd angles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they left early this morning for meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] your door is closed , so they thought you were still asleep in there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , good , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] i realize my night ##go ##wn is riding dangerously high on my thigh and pull up the sheet self - consciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` coffee , ' ' nate says , pointing to the bedside table next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over and see he ' s placed a steaming cup there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cream and one sugar , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , thanks , ' ' i reply , reaching for it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about last night . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t remember anything after i got home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile even though i ' m disappointed that he does n ' t remember the kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were drunk , and just asked me to stay here for a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to fall asleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at the clock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit , it ' s almost eleven ? [SEP]
[CLS] i never sleep that late . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t get up ' til nine - that ' s late for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mind quickly returns to my concerns from last night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i - i know you do n ' t like to talk about this , but your mom - ' ' ` ` what about her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , already sounding defensive . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to tread carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that it ' s painful to talk about , i just wanted to know : why did she leave ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate crosses his arms over his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eileen left because she could n ' t handle being a mother . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] how so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was out of control when i was a kid , and she could n ' t handle it . [SEP]
[CLS] could n ' t handle me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what your dad told you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what happened , ' ' nate replies , frowning at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i still remember the night she left . [SEP]
[CLS] they went out for dinner , and i stayed home with a baby ##sit ##ter . [SEP]
[CLS] one of many , because i kept driving them away , and i mis ##be ##ha ##ved again . [SEP]
[CLS] i threw a tan ##trum , broke a glass . . . i ' m pretty sure the baby ##sit ##ter quit as soon as my parents got home . [SEP]
[CLS] anyway , they got in this big fight - i could hear it even in my bedroom - and the next day she left . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' ve never seen her again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in court a couple times . [SEP]
[CLS] but after that , she was n ' t really interested in seeing me . [SEP]
[CLS] she tries to call here sometimes , maybe she feels guilty . [SEP]
[CLS] she always tries to blame my dad for what went down , ' ' he adds bitterly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you think that if . . . if you had been better , she would n ' t have left ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does n ' t matter now . [SEP]
[CLS] why are you asking about this stuff ? [SEP]
[CLS] did i talk about it when i was drunk or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i put my coffee down on the nightstand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she called here last night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eileen ? [SEP]
[CLS] you talked to her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , yeah , she was really upset . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck , bryn ##n , ' ' he swear ##s , standing up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would you do that ? [SEP]
[CLS] this has nothing to do with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was just trying to help . . . ' ' ` ` i do n ' t need your help , ' ' he spit ##s at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you just listen for a second ? ! [SEP]
[CLS] she called because she thought you might be willing to listen to her after what the woman said on the tv show - ' ' ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she said your dad was cheating on her , that ' s why she left . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing to do with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get out , ' ' he says , raising his voice and pointing to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , my dad left , too , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] i know what it ' s like . [SEP]
[CLS] but she sounded so lost , she ' s desperate to talk to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d kill for my dad to sound like that about me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , so that ' s what this is about , your daddy issues . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not what i meant , ' ' i plead , his words stinging to my core . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , i ' m sorry that your dad is n ' t around , but your whole situation has nothing to do with mine ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shout , feeling hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] i push off the sheets and stand up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promised her i ' d tell you , so i did . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll never try to help you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s all i ask ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he calls after me as i st ##omp out of his room . [SEP]
[CLS] i slam my bedroom door behind me , my fists ball ##ed in anger . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk straight to my bed and grab my pillow and swing it down as hard as i can onto the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] i . [SEP]
[CLS] ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] believe . [SEP]
[CLS] i . [SEP]
[CLS] ever . [SEP]
[CLS] had . [SEP]
[CLS] feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] for . [SEP]
[CLS] that . [SEP]
[CLS] asshole . [SEP]
[CLS] i think as i bring the pillow down again and again until i ' m out of breath . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s officially time for me to move on . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fifteen ` ` you look nice , ' ' my mom says as i enter the kitchen , giving me a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom . . . ' ' i reply , rolling my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you do ! [SEP]
[CLS] where are you two going tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` la mira ##belle . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` french - how romantic ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just a first date , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t get too excited . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i turn as nate and pierce enter from the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just have a good feeling about this one , that ' s all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she continues , pouring me a glass of water , ` ` and he ' s picking you up , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , do you have a date tonight , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce asks , wig ##gling his eyebrows at my mother . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' i groan , not wanting to make a big deal out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` greg ! [SEP]
[CLS] the intern from your office , ' ' my mom tells him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , well . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , i remember seeing you two huddled together in the copy room last week , and thinking to myself , ' those two would make a fine couple . ' ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blush as my mom smiles enthusiastically . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s amazing how quickly things have gotten back to normal after that woman went on tv . [SEP]
[CLS] for about a week , a handful of photographers waited around outside the gate , but they eventually left when the buzz died down . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce told us he has investigators working to disc ##red ##it the woman ' s claims , and that everything will be back to normal . [SEP]
[CLS] as for nate and me . . . ` ` so it ' ll just be the three of us for dinner then , ' ' my mom chi ##rp ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` two , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going out tonight , as well , ' ' nate replies casually . [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to resist the urge to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , you should ' ve let holly know about your plans . [SEP]
[CLS] how many times have i had this conversation with you ? [SEP]
[CLS] responsibility , responsibility , responsibility , ' ' pierce says as he crosses to the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at my mom , but she ' s looking down at her chop ##ping board . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , holly , ' ' nate says du ##ti ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s alright , really , ' ' my mom says quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself . [SEP]
[CLS] angry as i am at nate , i still do n ' t like to hear his dad speak to him in such a conde ##sc ##ending way . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk down the hallway to the foyer , and hear my mom and pierce following me . [SEP]
[CLS] i wince . [SEP]
[CLS] i was hoping i ' d get out the door without them all meeting - wish ##ful thinking , clearly . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile at greg as i open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s wearing a navy blaze ##r and k ##hak ##is , and looks a little nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , greg , ' ' i greet him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` greg ! [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s so nice to meet you , ' ' my mom says from behind me , forcing me to open the door all the way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good to see you , ' ' pierce says , shaking his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mr . thorn ##hill , ' ' greg replies formally . [SEP]
[CLS] i see nate appear in the entrance to the living room , leaning casually on the door ##ja ##mb but saying nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles at me as i catch his eye . [SEP]
[CLS] i frown at him and look away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have her home by ten , ' ' pierce ins ##truct ##s greg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , sir , ' ' greg replies . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce slap ##s him on the back just as i ' m about to protest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry , greg , i ' m just giving you a hard time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you had me for a second there , ' ' greg says , ex ##haling in relief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we should get going , ' ' i cut in so that pierce does n ' t have the chance to make any more hilarious jokes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you later ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call , pulling the door closed behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i just catch nate ' s smirk ##ing expression before i shut the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] greg asks as we walk to his car . [SEP]
[CLS] i force a smile and nod my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , sorry ! [SEP]
[CLS] my mind wandered for a second . [SEP]
[CLS] so , have you ever been to this restaurant before ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] greg chose a very nice french restaurant for our date , it ' s a cozy , softly lit place set in the hills of potomac . [SEP]
[CLS] the wait staff is clearly passionate about their food , and delighted to have a young couple on a date that they can fa ##wn over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , how is it working for your step ##dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] greg asks with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , it ' s not that bad . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly ever think twice about it , really . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s all the way at the top of the company , and i ' m all the way at the bottom , so we rarely interact on a day - to - day basis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` speaking of being at the bottom , roderick called me steven yesterday , ' ' greg says , referencing pierce ' s business partner . [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] is there even a steven working there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s the worst part . [SEP]
[CLS] who knows who he was thinking of . . . ' ' he shakes his head remorse ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how come pierce ' s son is n ' t working at thorn ##hill and co . ? [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t want to work with his dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , the opposite , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce is pretty hard on nate . . . i feel kind of guilty about the whole thing because i think nate wanted the internship , and then pierce offered it to me to punish him . [SEP]
[CLS] i tried not to accept , but pierce insisted , and we ' d just met , you know ? [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to be rude . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention , my mom and pierce have n ' t known each other for very long , so i was a little taken aback by how quickly they ' d gotten married . . . ' ' i bite my lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , wow . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m ram ##bling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok , i get it . [SEP]
[CLS] my parents are divorced , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , mine are n ' t actually divorced . [SEP]
[CLS] they were n ' t married in the first place , ' ' i clarify . [SEP]
[CLS] but greg is n ' t listening - he ' s squinting at the entrance to the restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` speaking of . . . is n ' t that nate now ? [SEP]
[CLS] did you tell him we were coming here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , what ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ca n ' t be him , ' ' i reply , turning around to look . [SEP]
[CLS] but sure enough , there he is , with a brunette stu ##nne ##r on his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] that asshole ! [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no way this is a coincidence - he must have overheard me telling my mom that greg was taking me here . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate says with a smile , leading his date over as the hostess trails them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know you guys were coming here too ! [SEP]
[CLS] greg , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good to meet you , ' ' greg says , shaking his outstretched hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and this is sophie , ' ' nate adds , indicating his date . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' she says , glancing up for a moment from the cell ##phone in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you all want to sit together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the hostess asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we could pull another table over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i could kill her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks greg , his grin at full - watt ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yeah , sure , why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] greg com ##pl ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] i quickly stand and make my way over to greg as a waiter helps the hostess pull another small table over . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not going to sit next to nate and risk a repeat of that thigh - touching incident . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll let you two sit next to each other , ' ' i explain with a sac ##cha ##rine smile as i take a seat next to greg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we just ordered so you ' re not too far behind , ' ' greg says as the hostess hands nate and sophie menu ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could we get a bottle of dom for the table ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks the waiter , who nods happily and sc ##ur ##ries off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you do n ' t have to - ' ' greg begins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i insist . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re interrupting your date here , ' ' nate replies magna ##ni ##mous ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love champagne , ' ' sophie pipes up , finally putting her phone away . [SEP]
[CLS] i narrow my eyes at nate and he studio ##usly avoids my gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what were you two love ##birds talking about before we got here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks greg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing , really , ' ' greg replies glancing at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , with your light hair , you two could almost be related . [SEP]
[CLS] cousins , maybe , ' ' nate observes , leaning back in his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] i swiftly kick his shin under the table . [SEP]
[CLS] i see his jaw tighten but he does n ' t even make a sound . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , totally ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sophie agrees . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i made out with my cousin once , but i did n ' t know he was my cousin at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] but then it happened again . . . ' ' i glare at nate as sophie launches into her story , and he smiles back at me . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s going to be a long night . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter sixteen i spin around in nate ' s desk chair as he shut ##s his bedroom door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been waiting here , fu ##ming , ever since greg dropped me off twenty minutes ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jesus ! [SEP]
[CLS] what are you , a bond villain ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , genuinely startled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what were you thinking ? ! [SEP]
[CLS] i know you did that on purpose to ruin my date , you fuck ##er ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , you really going to tell me you were having a great time before i got there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , so you were just helping me out , is that it ? [SEP]
[CLS] greg was completely weird ##ed out by the whole thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sophie had a nice time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sophie , please ! [SEP]
[CLS] where ' d you find her ? [SEP]
[CLS] a high school dance ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like her , ' ' he says with a smug grin as he sits on his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , really ? [SEP]
[CLS] so why are n ' t you with her right now ? [SEP]
[CLS] could n ' t seal the deal ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his smile fa ##lter ##s a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i did n ' t feel like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i guess there ' s a first time for everything . [SEP]
[CLS] just stay out of my life , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , and stalk toward the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll stay out of yours if you stay out of mine , ' ' he counters . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to face him , ` ` is that what this is about ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re mad because i told you your mom called , so you try to ruin my date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hold out my hands in surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it was n ' t that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have time to play games with a crazy man - child . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , alright ? [SEP]
[CLS] i just did n ' t like seeing you with that guy . . . something about his face is just , so punch - able , ' ' he says , standing up and walking over to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is the second time you ' ve come between me and a guy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hold up a hand to stop him from protesting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and yeah , i know , jackson was n ' t a good choice , but that ' s not the case with greg , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a nice guy . [SEP]
[CLS] so tell me , why do you care ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i challenge him as he looks down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a long pause as his pupils dil ##ate , i can practically feel him struggling with the truth , but i refuse to move until he admits it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know why , ' ' he says , looking me in the eye , his voice low and husky . [SEP]
[CLS] before i know what ' s happening , his arms are around me , pulling me against him . [SEP]
[CLS] his urgency takes my breath away - his fingers reach desperately under my shirt , grabbing at my bra strap and expert ##ly undo ##ing the clasp ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth dev ##ours mine as he reaches back around my waist and picks me up effortlessly , bringing me over to his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] as nate puts me down , i realize my bra is hanging free in the back , and he breaks away from our kiss to rip off my top . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses to look down at my breasts curving out of my limp bra before diving into my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , bryn ##n , i have to have you , ' ' he groans . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as he sinks his teeth into my skin and then flick ##s his tongue across my taut neck muscles on his way up to my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] my knees buckle as his tongue presses into my ear , and i grab onto his neck for support . [SEP]
[CLS] my mind ca n ' t keep up with what ' s happening , all my thoughts are a blur , but my body is urging me on , desperately . [SEP]
[CLS] as he sucks on my earl ##obe , i slide my hands down and under his shirt , finally feeling the body i ' ve coveted for so long . [SEP]
[CLS] his abs are even harder than i thought they would be , and they flex under my soft fingertips . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep sliding my hands upward , feeling his nipples harden under my palms , and i feel the growing bulge of his cock pressing against my thigh . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn nate thorn ##hill on . [SEP]
[CLS] holy fuck . [SEP]
[CLS] the thought drives me crazy and i feel myself instantly become moist with wanting , my body overcome with illicit , sin ##ful lust . [SEP]
[CLS] no man has ever made me feel this way before . [SEP]
[CLS] he steps back for a moment and pulls off his shirt , tossing it careless ##ly on the ground , revealing his incredible body for all its glory . [SEP]
[CLS] thousands of hours spent at the gym on and on the field have pains ##taking ##ly sculpted his muscles into a fucking masterpiece for woman ##kind . [SEP]
[CLS] he slowly reaches forward and takes my bra straps under his expert fingers , pulling them off my arms and tossing my bra onto the pile of clothes on the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] i shiver in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily as he looks down my exposed body , ex ##haling softly out of his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] he sinks to his knees in front of me and leans forward , kissing me gently on my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] i place my hands on his shoulders as he moves up , running his tongue underneath the cr ##ease of my breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out as he takes my right breast into his mouth , sucking hard on my nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] he brings one hand up to massage my left breast , and i dip my head back , feeling pleasure swell in my body like i never have before . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his fingers hook over the top of my skirt and slowly pull it down as his mouth moves to my left breast , softly biting it before flicking his tongue back and forth across my are ##ola . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear my skirt fall to the floor and his hands glide up my legs from my knees , his thumbs hook ##ing around my inner thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] he dip ##s his head and kisses me softly just above the top of my white cotton underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been dreaming about how sweet you taste , ' ' he murmurs , almost ina ##udi ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls my panties down just a bit and runs his tongue over the now exposed skin . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to shake , a mixture of un ##bri ##dled desire and nerves , as he slides my underwear down to my ankles . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his warm breath on my skin , just a moment before his mouth is on me , kissing and licking my most intimate of places . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily at the sensation . . . it ' s completely new to me , and it feels better than i ever could have imagined . [SEP]
[CLS] he flick ##s his tongue across my aching clit , sending jolt ##s of rap ##ture through every inch of me . [SEP]
[CLS] with one hand i tighten my grip on his strong shoulders , digging my fingers into his hair with the other , and letting my head dip back in utter bliss as he lick ##s my pussy with slow , strong strokes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , nate . . . ' ' i hear myself moan from far away as i ' m carried off by wave after wave of pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] before i know what ' s happening , my body spa ##sms , and i feel nate grab my ass to keep me upright and pressed against his skill ##ful mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] as i begin to come down , i feel his lick ##s becoming gentle ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he reaches up and puts his finger to my lips , and i instinctively take it into my mouth , licking and sucking his finger , thinking about how incredible it would feel to do this to another part of him . . . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls his finger out of my mouth and slips it carefully inside my tight pussy . [SEP]
[CLS] he circles it around slowly , and i can hear him grunt in satisfaction at my wet ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes begin to open slowly and i glance down at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he catches my eye and stands up , dipping his head down and catching me in a kiss , his finger still inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes widen as i taste myself on his lips and he pushes his tongue inside me with abandon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to make you feel so fucking good , ' ' he promises with a wicked smile , undo ##ing his belt buckle and un ##zi ##pping his pants in one fluid motion before pushing them and his boxers to the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] i gap ##e at his massive cock as it ' s un ##sh ##ea ##thed from his underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] its size snaps me back to the reality of what ' s about to happen , and i feel overcome with fear and ad ##ren ##ali ##n . . . but i ca n ' t take my eyes off it . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to feel him inside of me so much , but i think there ' s one thing i need to tell him first . [SEP]
[CLS] he bites his lip and moves against me again . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his cock , throbbing and ready , against my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] he wraps his arms around me , and ease ##s me back onto the bed and lays on top of me , kissing my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . i . . . i have to tell you . . . ' ' i murmur , his mouth a complete distraction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , whatever it is , it does n ' t matter now , ' ' he replies , biting my earl ##obe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it might , though . [SEP]
[CLS] i just thought i should tell you , or warn you maybe , in case i ' m not very good - ' ' ` ` i doubt that - ' ' ` ` i ' m a virgin . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his body stiff ##en as the words cross my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls back and looks me in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] no . [SEP]
[CLS] no way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to do this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how . . . how are you a virgin ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] oh , dear . [SEP]
[CLS] this is not the kind of conversation i want to have right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , i just am . [SEP]
[CLS] it just has n ' t happened yet , but i ' m ready now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' ve . . . you must have done some things . . . ' ' he begins worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , sure , you know , kissing . . . ' ' ` ` and ? [SEP]
[CLS] wait , was that the first time anyone ' s ever gone down on you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i can only shrug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t think it would be that big of a deal . [SEP]
[CLS] i just was telling you , in case i ' m not that good , or if i bleed or something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rolls off of me and sits up . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , it is a big deal , it ' s a very big deal to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand . . . ' ' i reply , sitting up and pulling the sheet over to cover me , suddenly feeling very self - conscious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just , your first time . . . it ' s going to mean a lot to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , confused . [SEP]
[CLS] he spreads his hands open on his legs but does n ' t say anything . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a sensation like a rock sinking to the bottom of my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . . . you ' re saying it will mean a lot to me , but it wo n ' t mean a lot to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare straight forward as he turns to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , you ' re smart , gorgeous , funny , ambitious . . . you ' re wonderful . . . but like i told you before , i do n ' t lie to women and say that i ' m interested in something more when i ' m not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i forgot about your policy , ' ' i reply flatly , feeling like the biggest idiot in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the biggest naked idiot in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could you . . . could you close your eyes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i ' ve seen - ' ' ` ` just close them , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at him to make sure he ' s complied , and then stand up and begin to gather my clothes from the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] i slip everything back on as quickly as i can , and then look back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes are closed , and he ' s sitting nude and perfectly still on the edge of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks as perfect as i ' ve ever seen him look , which is really saying something . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart breaks a little , as i move to the door and shut it behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry down the hall and into my own bedroom , which now feels cold and empty . [SEP]
[CLS] i crawl into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m no different to nate thorn ##hill than any of the other girls he ' s been with , and i should have known that . [SEP]
[CLS] stupid , stupid , stupid . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear a soft knock at the door and pull the covers up a little higher , but do n ' t answer . [SEP]
[CLS] if it ' s my mom , i do n ' t want to see her , and if it ' s nate , i really do n ' t want to see him . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s another knock , a little louder , and then the door is slowly pushed open . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just see nate ' s shadow in the moonlight . [SEP]
[CLS] he closes the door behind him and moves into the room . [SEP]
[CLS] to my surprise , he walks around the foot of my bed and to the other side , then hop ##s on , lying down over the covers next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he whispers , laying his hands over his stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] you were just being honest . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i think i do . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' ll stop interfering with you and other guys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i clear my throat to keep the pain down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t really have female friends . . . ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dana ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dana and i are , well , fuck buddies , mostly . [SEP]
[CLS] and that ' s what she wants , too , so it ' s ok . ' ' ` ` mmm . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' d . . . i ' d like us to be friends . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re already step - siblings , ' ' i point out . [SEP]
[CLS] i can hear him smile next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` true . [SEP]
[CLS] but that was n ' t by choice . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t deny that i ' m attracted to you , of course , but i ' m just not the relationship kind of guy . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention the kind of issues that dating my own steps ##ister would bring up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so can we be friends ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i consider for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' m nate ' s only female friend , then i really am different to him . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe not in the way i ' d most like , but still , it ' s something . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . friends , then . [SEP]
[CLS] wait , actually , ' ' i turn onto my side and face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` before we ' re officially friends , i have to ask you some non - friend questions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . . . ' ' he replies warily , turning on his side , too . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was i . . . am i . . . ok at all that stuff ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know . . . ' ' he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what we just did , you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] yes . [SEP]
[CLS] you are more than ok at it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when did you lose your virginity ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i was fourteen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was my friend ' s older sister . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many women have you slept with ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , i do n ' t even know . . . ' ' ` ` wait , really ? [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t even know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , dozens ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t count . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ##esh . [SEP]
[CLS] ok , one more : why are n ' t you the relationship kind of guy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , ' ' he says softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i tried a couple times , but that kind of closeness , it just makes me uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s all i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , sensing he ' s telling me everything he can , and roll back over onto my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i like the feeling of lying here with him next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel much more comfortable than i would have thought possible . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my eyes beginning to flutter closed as sleep pulls me under . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n . . . i . . . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i can just hear nate say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to make some man very happy one day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seventeen ` ` i ' m just glad the whole thing has blown over , ' ' greg says as we pull off the belt ##way . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod as i look out at the trees w ##hi ##zzi ##ng by in the dark . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman who accused pierce of sexual harassment res ##cin ##ded her claims after it turned out she had accused two other former bosses of the same thing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it just feels like there ' s been a shadow over the office for the last month . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , ' ' i reply non ##com ##mit ##tal ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] greg clears his throat as we near my house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , i ' m glad we got the chance to go out again , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me too , ' ' i reply with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] this is our third date , and he still has n ' t tried anything . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m wondering if tonight will be the night . [SEP]
[CLS] a nervous silence falls over the car as we pull through the gates and onto the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] he stops in front of the house and then turns to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t i walk you to your door , ' ' he suggests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a few butterflies begin to fly around in my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] we undo our seat belts and hop out , meeting around the front of the car and walking up to the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there were something calming i could say to him , because he looks way more nervous than i do . [SEP]
[CLS] we reach the door and turn to each other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , goodnight , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses , looking into my eyes , and then begins to move forward . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean in , and close my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips touch mine and i frown slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , there ' s nothing wrong with his lips or anything , but i thought i ' d feel . . . more . [SEP]
[CLS] he keeps his mouth cha ##ste ##ly pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and smiles at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight , bryn ##n , ' ' he says again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight , ' ' i reply , and turn to go inside . [SEP]
[CLS] i shut the door behind me , and lean back against it , disappointed . [SEP]
[CLS] greg and i get along well , and he ' s such a nice guy - i ' d hoped i would eventually develop romantic feelings for him . . . but that kiss . . . was not so good . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh and continue through the foyer and into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' nate greet ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i stop as a buzz runs through me at just the sight of him . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s the feeling i ca n ' t manufacture when i ' m with greg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey . [SEP]
[CLS] you go for a run ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , taking in his sweaty appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , just on the tread ##mill . [SEP]
[CLS] too dark for a trail run . [SEP]
[CLS] did you . . . did you have a nice time tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he gulp ##s a long sip from a ga ##tor ##ade bottle and then puts it down on the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yeah , it was good , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you ' re interested . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , but i choose tonight , ' ' i reply with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve both committed to this whole being friends thing , though at times i feel like i ' m going through the motions . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i ' ll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want more from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no romantic comedies , ' ' he says , as he walks to the door of the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just going to hop in the shower really fast . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the phone on the counter rings and he steps toward it , but it only rings once . [SEP]
[CLS] we both look toward pierce ' s study as raised voices em ##ana ##te from that direction . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , we hear st ##omp ##ing coming our way and frown at each other in concern . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce storms in and walks to the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` reporter ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your mother , ' ' pierce replies , equally quietly , though there ' s a hint of venom in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes flick over to nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope i have n ' t made the situation worse by taking her call that one time . [SEP]
[CLS] he meets my gaze and shakes his head quickly as though to warn me not to say anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know how she got this new number - it ' s un ##list ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] that bitch just wo n ' t give up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth drops open at pierce ' s language . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never even heard him swear before , and it ' s so at odds with his gen ##tee ##l appearance that it sounds even more shocking coming out of his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re going to go watch a movie , ' ' i murmur , wanting to get away from him when he ' s in this kind of mood . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the waves of anger coming off of him . [SEP]
[CLS] but pierce swings around to face nate , the ga ##tor ##ade bottle in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many fucking times have i told you to clean up after yourself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growls , and i shrink back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t done drinking - ' ' nate begins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t interrupt me ! [SEP]
[CLS] you think the rest of the world is just here to serve you ? [SEP]
[CLS] that everyone else exists to make your cu ##sh ##y life a little easier ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve never had to work for anything in your life . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s pathetic , ' ' pierce spit ##s at his son . [SEP]
[CLS] i remain frozen on the other side of the counter , feeling like a coward , and not knowing what i should say . [SEP]
[CLS] i see color rise in nate ' s cheeks , but all he says is , ` ` yes , sir . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , pierce slams the bottle back on the counter and walks back toward his office without even looking at me . [SEP]
[CLS] nate remains motionless for a moment , then walks over to the bottle , drinks the rest of it , and toss ##es it into the recycling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , you did n ' t deserve - ' ' i start , feeling horrified by the scene i just witnessed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you still want to watch that movie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks , tilting his head toward me but not making eye contact . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' i whisper back , unsure of what else to do or say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , meet you in there in ten minutes , ' ' nate says simply and walks out . [SEP]
[CLS] i wait until i can hear him walking up the stairs before i move . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never heard a father talk to his son like that before , and our old neighborhood was n ' t exactly full of model families . [SEP]
[CLS] and the way nate ' s shoulders slumped as pierce was speaking to him , it was like he agreed with what his father was saying about him . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk up the stairs to my room and change into my sweat ##s , before heading back downstairs to make some popcorn - food always makes me feel better . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as it ' s finished popping , i head into the den to wait for nate . [SEP]
[CLS] should i tell my mom about what pierce just did ? [SEP]
[CLS] would she even listen ? [SEP]
[CLS] she seems to have drunk the pierce ko ##ol - aid pretty heavily by this point . [SEP]
[CLS] and now that pierce has been the victim of false allegations , it will be even harder for her to believe anything bad about him . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up , frowning , as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can tell by that expression on your face that you want to talk , ' ' he begins . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile slightly , he knows me well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but the stuff with my parents - it ' s off - limits , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] but i need to tell him that those things pierce said are n ' t true . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just - ' ' ` ` no , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] i really want us to be able to keep hanging out . [SEP]
[CLS] but if you keep bringing it up . . . ' ' i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t say anything . [SEP]
[CLS] in exchange , though . . . ' ' i walk to the wide book ##case ##s full of dvd options . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no romantic comedies ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` big fish , ' ' i say , pulling out the case . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that a romantic comedy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , narrowing his eyes suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , not really . [SEP]
[CLS] there is romance in it , but it ' s more about a family , ' ' i explain , careful not to mention the predominant father - son themes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , friendships have to have some compromise , ' ' i add with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , fine , ' ' he says , rolling his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes a handful of popcorn and leans against one end of the couch as i pop the dvd in . [SEP]
[CLS] as i make myself comfortable on the other end , he pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and arrange ##s it over my feet , because he knows that they get cold . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a pang in my chest at the small gesture , but try to push it away . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s not being romantic , just thoughtful . [SEP]
[CLS] i look up at the large tv screen as the picture comes up . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel more comfortable around nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now , so i have to settle for being friends with him . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise i could lose him altogether . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eighteen ` ` you and nate head down there so we do n ' t lose the reservation ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom ins ##truct ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] she planned a family outing to go raft ##ing on the potomac , but pierce is stuck at the office in meetings , even though it ' s a saturday . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll swing by and get him and meet you there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , he said he ' d only be a little longer , ' ' she assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i reply with a shrug , and walk into the ant ##ero ##om off the kitchen where nate is slipping on his sneakers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mom says they ' re going to meet us there , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck it , let ' s make tracks , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smirk ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] and off we go in his wr ##ang ##ler , nate blasting some god - awful metal music . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how do you listen to this shit ? [SEP]
[CLS] it sounds like two cat ' s screwing in a trash ##can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is slayer , they ' re classic trash metal , you have to have respect . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says rev ##ere ##ntly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i always listen to reign in blood before all of my games . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lovely . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i screw my face up in mock horror . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns it up louder , nodding his head enthusiastically as the guitar riff ##s col ##lide into what i assume is his favorite part of the song . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s strange to see him let loose like this , and even though i think his taste in music is ho ##rri ##fying , i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , the boat ##house is just a little ways down the potomac in the direction of the city , and i ' m only subjected to slayer for a few more minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] the temperature on this august day is in the mid - nine ##ties , but my mom was insistent upon doing a family activity outdoors . [SEP]
[CLS] as we take a left on the dirt road with an old sign pointing the way , i spot an empty parking lot , and figure most people are wise ##ly staying inside with their air - conditioning today . [SEP]
[CLS] after we park , nate heads over to the wood - sl ##att ##ed structure to secure the boat , and i take the suns ##creen out of my bag . [SEP]
[CLS] as nate walks back over , he smiles as he sees me struggling to sm ##ear it in between the straps of my sports bra . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want some help ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` . . . sure , ' ' i reply , though i ' m anything but . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of nate ' s hands on me , when i know nothing else is going to happen , sounds like torture . [SEP]
[CLS] i might actually prefer getting a first - degree sun ##burn , but he ' s already taken the bottle from me and squeezing some of it out into his palm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , just pull the back of your shirt up , ' ' he ins ##truct ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i do as he says , pulling it up to my hair ##line . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his grease ##d - up hands slipping under the straps of my bra , and am glad he ca n ' t see the blush that immediately spreads across my face . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath , trying to keep my raging hormones at bay , as his fingers slide around the side of my rib ##ca ##ge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you do me , ' ' he says , as i release my shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what she said , ' ' i mutter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ha ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate bark ##s , a short , joy ##ful shout of laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know you were funny bryn ##n , ' ' he says , grinning wide at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s a lot you do n ' t know about me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , daring to meet his gaze for a brief moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i clear my throat and take the bottle of suns ##creen from him , willing myself to keep my thoughts clean . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses , then turns around and pulls off his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i groan inwardly at the sight of his wide , muscular back . [SEP]
[CLS] where are our parents ? [SEP]
[CLS] i need some kind of buffer between us . [SEP]
[CLS] but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon , so i du ##ti ##fully squeeze some lot ##ion onto my fingers and then begin to spread it across his back . [SEP]
[CLS] i carefully press it all the way up to his neck , across his shoulder blades - feeling the sin ##ew ##y ropes of muscle there , down his back , and finally down to the top of his athletic shorts , my fingers vent ##uring just inside his waistband . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him suck in a small bit of air , and see the slight throbbing of his member in his shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s trying hard to hold back , i can tell . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , all done ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say overly cheer ##ily , as i hand him the bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] nate toss ##es his shirt into the back of his jeep and begins to spread suns ##creen across his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep my eyes trained on the hazy river . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they say how long they were going to be ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , my mom just said - ' ' i break off as i hear my phone start to ring in my purse on the front seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bet that ' s her now . [SEP]
[CLS] hey , mom , ' ' i greet her as i accept the call . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , honey . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , immediately hearing stress in her voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it ' s nothing , but pierce wo n ' t be able to get out of the office long enough to go kay ##aking today . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just going to drive down to the office now , so at least he and i can have lunch together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , should we - ' ' ` ` no , you two go kay ##aking and have fun , alright ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll see you tonight for dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , alright , if you ' re sure , ' ' i reply , win ##cing as i catch nate watching me , his muscular torso gleaming in the sun . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your dad got caught up in work stuff , and my mom ' s going to go meet him at the office for lunch , so they ' re not coming . [SEP]
[CLS] they said we should still go if we want , ' ' i explain as i hang up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since we ' re here , ' ' nate says with a shrug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ever been kay ##aking here before ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never been kay ##aking at all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , you ' ll love it , ' ' he replies , locking up his car . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` says the captain of the uv ##a crew team . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] in short order , we ' re pushing off the dock in a tandem kay ##ak . [SEP]
[CLS] with nate ' s powerful o ##ar strokes , we quickly clear the shallow , muddy water and head toward the open water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll get the hang of it , ' ' nate encourages me , and i turn around to smile sheep ##ishly at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' m just holding you back , here , ' ' i laugh , trying to get the feeling of how to dip the o ##ar in the water at the right time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i have a lot more experience than you in a boat , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we used to train for crew on the potomac in high school , but we were a lot closer in to the city . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d pass georgetown , the kennedy center . . . you ' d be amazed at the wildlife you can see out here , though , ' ' he tells me as he steer ##s us up ##river and into the current . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel so far away from everything , ' ' i observe as the sounds of traffic are quickly covered up by the trees rising on either side of us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this land used to belong to a native american tribe called the - ' ' ` ` pi ##sca ##ta ##way , ' ' i finish reflex ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` damn , i keep forgetting my steps ##ister is a ne ##rd , ' ' he says , and i can hear from his voice that he ' s grinning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t even try to impress you with my passion for local history , then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , come on , impress me , ' ' i tease him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t hold a candle , ' ' he fei ##gn ##s defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you get better grades than me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , put me on two varsity teams and i think those grades might dip a little . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know how you do it . [SEP]
[CLS] my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time at the library - i barely have enough time for them . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention , i ' m not athletic ##ally gifted at all , ' ' i add , nodding to my in ##ef ##fect ##ual rowing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ve got me there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i met allison on the 4th , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but miriam ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s back home in memphis for the summer . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s my other good friend ; she and allison room together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you live with them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , and i pause to listen to his o ##ars dropping quietly into the water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm , i thought about it , but i like living alone . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom can be . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pro ##ds me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m trying to think of a more flat ##tering word for needy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can say needy if you want . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t tell . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , she ' s really fucking needy , ' ' i reply , feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly ever talk about the more negative aspects of my relationship with my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly , a lot less so since she ' s met pierce , though . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes i just feel like i ' m - ' ' ` ` her mom , ' ' he finishes for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to face him , raising my eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it obvious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mean to sound res ##ent ##ful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re allowed to feel however you want about her , ' ' he responds with a kind smile , and i turn back around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at first i thought you were fragile , ' ' he says after a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like if i dropped you , you ' d break . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that ' s why . . . that ' s why i wanted to test you a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean when you felt me up at dinner with our parents sitting across from us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe i did that , and i do n ' t think i ' ve ever apologized . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you did n ' t , jerk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , you do n ' t think i ' m fragile now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you ' re one of the tough ##est people i ' ve ever met . [SEP]
[CLS] look ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance back toward him and follow where ' s he ' s pointing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a great blue heron , ' ' he explains as i spot the huge bird with its wings spread , perched on a rock in the middle of the river . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s how they dry their feathers after they dive for fish . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stops rowing for a while as we watch it . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly it pulls its wings in , gathers itself like a coil , and launches into the air . [SEP]
[CLS] we watch it fly into the distant tree ##tops before we begin pad ##dling up the river again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you interested in history ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like understanding why people behave the way they do , ' ' he explains quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his own history , trying to respect the boundaries he ' s put up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s greg ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn around and narrow my eyes at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s a friendly question , ' ' he says with a devil ##ish grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i do n ' t want to talk about it , ' ' i reply , a little more huff ##ily than i intend to . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . . . so that either means really good or really bad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not really bad , ' ' i protest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - oh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just , there ' s no . . . you know . . . ' ' ` ` spark ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to tell him soon - i do n ' t want him to get hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i think i ' m breaking his heart or anything - ' ' ` ` i saw the way he looks at you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` meaning ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s falling fast . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d tell him before he falls any further . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re ex ##agger ##ating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words . [SEP]
[CLS] the stillness of the river , broken only by a soft wind blowing through the trees , helps to ease my anxiety over the conversation i need to have with greg . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of ` ` problems ' ' seems to fade out here , though perhaps it ' s the un ##rel ##enting heat , which feels like it ' s beginning to melt my body into the seat of the kay ##ak . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab the sweating bottle of water from between my feet and take a long sw ##ig . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` water ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask nate , turning to offer it to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes it , brushing my fingers with his as he wraps his long fingers around it . [SEP]
[CLS] my insides clench . . . speaking of a spark . [SEP]
[CLS] i spot a house very much like ours up on a hillside in the distance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' d you live before the house now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` town ##house in georgetown . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was less of a be ##hem ##oth . [SEP]
[CLS] had more character . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the mansion is n ' t your taste ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was always big for two people , and it still seems big , even for four . [SEP]
[CLS] but what i really do n ' t like is that it ' s got all these fake historical touches about it , and none of them are genuine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ana ##the ##ma to a history major . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] i always pictured myself in a smaller house , maybe a converted barn or something . . . one that was actually built in the time period it looks like it was built in . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe somewhere quieter than dc . . . it ' s pretty eli ##tist here . . . i want my kids to grow up more modest ##ly than i did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want kids ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i do . . . i ' m just surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] you know that having kids might nec ##ess ##itate being in a relationship with a woman for longer than you ' re used to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i honestly had n ' t thought of that . [SEP]
[CLS] i always just pictured myself with kids . [SEP]
[CLS] is that horrible ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , quickly reaching down and fling ##ing water back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cries , and grabs the sides of the kay ##ak , beginning to rock it back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll tip this thing over , ' ' he warns me with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i protest , grabbing on . [SEP]
[CLS] he re ##lent ##s , and keeps rowing after a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think your mom picked the hottest day of the year , ' ' he observes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want to head back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , hoping he ' ll say no . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess we should . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , feeling disappointed , and dip my o ##ar in the water to help him turn the kay ##ak . [SEP]
[CLS] now that we ' re going with the current , it takes us much less time to make the return trip back to the boat house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s your shoulder ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s better , actually , ' ' he says happily , ` ` thanks for asking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a tightening in my throat as we pull into the shallow ##er water . [SEP]
[CLS] nate steps onto the dock first , then offers me his hand to help me get out of the un ##stead ##y boat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` much sha ##dier under the trees , ' ' he observes , nodding to a hiking trail that cuts through the trees behind the boat house . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at him questioning ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` short hike before we go back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod and smile , trying not to look too pleased . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter nineteen ` ` you ' ve got good st ##amina for someone who does n ' t do sports , ' ' nate observes as our ` ` short hike ' ' goes into its second hour . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been swimming in the pool pretty frequently , maybe that ' s it , ' ' i reply , though really i think it ' s that the conversation has n ' t stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re high over the potomac now , on a dirt trail that winds around large boulders . [SEP]
[CLS] he was right - it is cooler under the trees , but it ' s still just as humid . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , pointing to a three - leave ##d plant at the base of a tree . [SEP]
[CLS] after telling nate that i manage to get poison ivy every other year , he ' s made it his mission to teach me how to identify the rash - causing the plant . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not red enough . [SEP]
[CLS] by this time of the summer , it ' ll be more red and oil ##y - looking . [SEP]
[CLS] and the edges of the leaves are too jagged , ' ' he says as he bends over to look at it . [SEP]
[CLS] a pair of female hike ##rs approach us on the trail , headed the opposite direction . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch them drink in nate ' s shirt ##less , sweaty appearance and giggle to each other . [SEP]
[CLS] as they pass , they smile flirt ##ati ##ously at him , but he just politely smiles back before turning to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re good at so many things , but identifying plant species . . . ' ' he into ##nes in a mock - serious voice as he shakes his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , if that ' s my weakness , i ' ll take it , ' ' i reply with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , poison ivy , that ' s your k ##ry ##pton ##ite , ' ' he tease ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s yours ? [SEP]
[CLS] intimacy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` intimacy ? [SEP]
[CLS] how dare you ! [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s commitment . [SEP]
[CLS] very different . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , du ##h , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] my apologies , ' ' i reply , glad we can joke about this kind of thing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , there ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , pointing to an ivy crawling up a tree trunk on the river side of the trail . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t see it , ' ' nate replies , cr ##ani ##ng his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i repeat , walking off the trail and into the under ##brush . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , be careful ! [SEP]
[CLS] and i do n ' t think that ' s poison ivy , anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , really ! [SEP]
[CLS] see , it ' s red - ' ' i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way . [SEP]
[CLS] what i thought was solid earth was just an over ##hang of vegetation . [SEP]
[CLS] my stomach flies into my throat as i begin to fall , the horizon instantly becoming a blur . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp and turn , frantically grabbing onto the dirt and branches nearby . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate yells , and dive ##s into the brush after me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him grab my hand as i struggle to find a foot ##hold on the steep hill beneath me . [SEP]
[CLS] my feet frantically search for support and i begin to panic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok , it ' s ok , i ' ve got you , ' ' nate says . [SEP]
[CLS] the ste ##adi ##ness in his voice causes me to look up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s looking back down at me , his eyes sure and calm . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath and reach my other hand up . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabs it and begins to pull me up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` under your right foot , there ' s a rock , ' ' he says , peering over the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t look down , just feel for it . [SEP]
[CLS] just an inch to your left . [SEP]
[CLS] keep looking at me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the expression in his eyes arrests me , and i still for a moment , then slowly begin to move my foot to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] there . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my sneak ##er knock against it , and move my foot up and onto it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , now just push off and i ' ll pull you up . [SEP]
[CLS] one , two , three ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shove my foot down and he knee ##ls and pulls me up and back onto him . [SEP]
[CLS] i land square ##ly on top of him , shaking with fear and adrenaline . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his arms reach around me and squeeze , almost pressing the last of the air out of me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck , bryn ##n , ' ' he whispers in my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , realizing he ' s landed on his back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` am i ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , sounding shocked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , i think so , though it ' s hard to tell right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] here , stand up , ' ' he says , and i lean to the side of him . [SEP]
[CLS] he jumps up then offers me both hands . [SEP]
[CLS] i take them and stand , win ##cing as i put weight on my right foot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my ankle , i think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get back on the trail where i can look at it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he takes my arm and wraps it around his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his arm around my waist and i ' m practically lifted off my feet as he walks me back onto the trail . [SEP]
[CLS] he guides me down to a seated position and i lean back on my hands as he gently picks up my right foot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a little swollen , ' ' he observes , ` ` but i do n ' t think it ' s broken - probably a bad sp ##rain . [SEP]
[CLS] think you ' re ok to walk back if i help you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i ' ll be fine , ' ' i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] he helps me stand up and puts my arm around his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath as we take our awkward first steps back toward the boat ##house , and i realize i ' m in for a full hour of being pressed up against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re really sweaty , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , you better be careful or i might lose my grip , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how high up was i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably best not to think about it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s pretty high . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m glad you ' re alright . . . mostly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if it ' s the scare from almost falling , or if we ' re both just tired , but the slow walk back takes place in almost silence . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could think of something to say to break the tension , but having his shirt ##less body pressed up against me is too much . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel our sweat ming ##ling together and our breath sync ##ing along with the rhythm of our footsteps . [SEP]
[CLS] as we finally sight the parking lot , he stops and moves in front of me , then bends over , looking back at me expect ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh and lift my bad leg up onto him , and then jump up as he ho ##ists me the rest of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] he walks with me on his back until we reach the car , then deposits me right next to the passenger side door . [SEP]
[CLS] as he jo ##gs around to the driver ' s side , i turn to look around the parking lot . [SEP]
[CLS] there are still only a few cars here , and in the corner is a blue sedan with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at her for a moment , because with her blonde hair , i thought for a moment that she was my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] as we make eye contact she quickly looks away , and i hear the car start after a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe she was just staring at nate like the other women we encountered today . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe she ' s a reporter . . . pierce warned the family that there could still be a few hanging around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ok to get in by yourself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks , rolling down the window . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , yeah , sorry , ' ' i reply , snapping back to attention . [SEP]
[CLS] i open the door and use my left leg to hop into the elevated seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , it ' s fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when we arrive back at the house , nate basket - carries me straight from the car into the kitchen , gently setting me down on a chair in the breakfast no ##ok . [SEP]
[CLS] he knee ##ls in front of me and un ##lace ##s my shoe , then slips it off and peel ##s my sock off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you wig ##gle your toes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i move them back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and now really slowly move your whole foot around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i wince as i circle it and pain shoots up through my leg . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i broke my ankle playing lacrosse my junior year , and i do n ' t think that ' s what this is . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s ice and wrap it and see how it is tomorrow , or monday . [SEP]
[CLS] if it ' s still bad , i ' ll take you to the doctor . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know how to wrap it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , when it ' s not my own hand , i ' m pretty good at it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i watch him take down that same first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the floor as he knee ##ls in front of me again . [SEP]
[CLS] he carefully wraps athletic tape around my ankle and then around the middle of my foot , hook ##ing it around and around until my ankle is firmly stabilized . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , let ' s get you into the den so we can ice it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to stand but he bends over and scoop ##s me up again , carrying me through the hallways to the cozy den . [SEP]
[CLS] he sets me down on the couch and then disappears . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab a pillow and set it behind my back as i stretch my legs out , marvel ##ing at the sudden appearance of nate ' s caretaker instincts . [SEP]
[CLS] he re ##app ##ears with a zip ##lo ##c bag of crushed ice and a glass of water , setting the latter down on the table next to me before lowering the ice down onto my ankle . [SEP]
[CLS] i shiver as he places it down , and he pulls the throw down from the back of the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabs one end and un ##fold ##s it , then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to lay it over me , tucking the corners in around my body . [SEP]
[CLS] i become very aware of my own breathing as he moves over me . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch his hands as they take the edge of the blanket and tuck it around my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] his right hand moves slowly from the blanket onto the exposed skin of my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] i hold my breath as he lightly runs his fingertips up onto my jaw , then over to my chin . [SEP]
[CLS] with his thumb and fore ##finger , he gently tilt ##s my head up until i look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s staring at my mouth , and only pauses for a moment before he bends down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t , ' ' i whisper as he ' s just inches away from kissing me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t want anything more , it ' s just cruel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i do want something more ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , his dark blue eyes flicking up to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more . . . ' ' i repeat , rolling the word around my tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what kind of more ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never felt about someone the way i feel about you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve tried fighting that feeling , i ' ve tried reasoning with it , but it just keeps getting stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to give in - i need to . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t tell you i know exactly what this will look like . . . i ' ve never done anything like it . [SEP]
[CLS] but i promise you that when i ' m with you , i ' ll be with only you . [SEP]
[CLS] and i want you to be with only me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s still a lot of unknown ##s , but i sense that he ' s giving me everything he can right now . [SEP]
[CLS] plus my heart is about to beat out of my chest , and my resistance is giving out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only you , ' ' i nod , before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] our lips meet in an open kiss , our tongues finding each other ' s and ming ##ling with desperate passion . [SEP]
[CLS] he presses me back against the cushion , his hands grasping my waist over the blanket and quickly moving up and over my breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] i arch my back into him , wanting to feel him against me . . . feel him everywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you guys home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate jumps away as we hear my mom ' s voice from the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes a deep breath and then runs his hand through his hair before responding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re in the den ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he calls back , then turns to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tonight , ' ' he murmurs , his eyes burning with promise . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty ` ` are you ok , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks me , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i ' m fine , ' ' i reply lightly as i use my napkin to try to clean the tomato sauce off my shirt where i ' ve just spilled it . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s promise of an evening rendezvous has left me clumsy and distracted throughout dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] i had just finished cleaning up the glass of water i knocked off the table when i dropped a piece of chicken off my fork and onto my shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry i could n ' t make it today , guys , ' ' pierce says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks like you could have used some more supervision . [SEP]
[CLS] nate should n ' t have taken you on any dangerous trails . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it was n ' t dangerous , ' ' i rush to nate ' s defense . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he was trying to teach me how to spot poison ivy , actually , and i walked right off the trail . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t realize how close i was to the edge and the ground just gave way under me . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all my fault . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the one who pulled me back up and taped my ankle . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , it could n ' t hurt to get it looked at by a doctor on monday , ' ' my mom points out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think it ' ll be fine , really , ' ' i insist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyone want dessert ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , thanks , ' ' nate and i both respond at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip to keep from laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s so amusing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce asks , looking at his son , his voice dangerously quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` inside joke , ' ' i reply quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll help you clear the table , mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we both stand and grab a couple plates and head into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the swinging door shut ##s behind me , i hear pierce ' s voice . [SEP]
[CLS] even though his words are muffled , i can tell by his tone that he ' s be ##rating nate for something . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] she turns on the water and begins ri ##ns ##ing off the plates before putting them into the dish ##wash ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it ok with you that he talks to nate like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s between the two of them , ' ' my mom replies quietly without looking up at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel anger surge inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you keep trying to make us a family , but then you wo n ' t get involved in their relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t have it both ways . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before she can reply , i spin back around and into the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce breaks off abruptly as i enter the room , and i quickly clear the rest of the dishes before limp ##ing upstairs to my room . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath as i close my bedroom door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to have this night ruined by my anger at my mom and pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] i head into the bathroom and turn on my shower . [SEP]
[CLS] i still have n ' t had a chance to wash off the sweat from our kay ##aking and hiking trip today , and i want to smell like a rose tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] my body tingle ##s in anticipation as i peel off my shirt and shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance down at my wrapped ankle , wondering if it ' s ok to get wet . [SEP]
[CLS] probably fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull off my sports bra and underwear and then study myself in the mirror , running my hands over my breasts and then across my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s already seen me naked , i remind myself , as nerves surge up in my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] and i already know he likes me . [SEP]
[CLS] it will be ok . [SEP]
[CLS] i step under the hot stream of water and take my time washing my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] as the condition ##er sets , i shave my legs and my bikini line , going a little bit narrower than i would normally . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that a lot of girls at college go completely bare , but i ca n ' t bring myself to go that far . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn off the water and towel myself off , then part my hair in the middle and let it air dry . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull a pair of cotton pa ##ja ##ma bottoms and a cam ##iso ##le from my bureau and put them on . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure if that ' s sexy or not , but i ' m trying not to over ##thi ##nk it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m certainly not succeeding , but i am trying . [SEP]
[CLS] i head over to my computer and sit down . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that nate will probably wait for our parents to go to bed before he does anything , so i ' ve got a couple of hours to go at least . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to click around the internet , but i ' m not able to absorb myself in anything . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep wondering what ' s going to happen tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to get my hopes up , but i think i have an idea . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , i know what i want to happen . [SEP]
[CLS] i finally decide to play some mind ##less tv on hu ##lu , and settle back in my chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight , bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i finally hear my mom call as she heads up to the third floor . [SEP]
[CLS] i freeze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call back , and immediately begin pulling at the ends of my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep watching tv until i hear pierce heading upstairs , too , then quickly close my computer and hurry into the bathroom , win ##cing as i put too much weight on my right ankle . [SEP]
[CLS] i run my fingers through my hair and decide i should brush my teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i ' m putting my tooth ##brush back down , i hear a soft knock at my door . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart jumps in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk back into my bedroom just in time to see the door open and nate stick his head in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' i murmur . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' he replies , taking a couple more steps in and closing the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile at him nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] i suddenly have no idea what to say - the usual ease of conversation between us is replaced with ji ##tter ##y nerves and excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] his appearance right now is n ' t helping matters . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s barefoot , and wearing jeans and a v - neck white t - shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks imp ##oss ##ibly , effortlessly sexy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t remember the last time i was nervous with a woman , ' ' he finally says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , well . . . good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m nervous , too , i mean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles and begins to walk slowly toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to do everything with you , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of being the first one to show you . . . everything . . . ' ' he takes a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' m going to go slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to tell me if i ' m ever moving too quickly , alright ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s going to be hard for me not to get caught up in the moment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod and realize that i ' ve been holding my breath while he ' s been talking . [SEP]
[CLS] he stops just in front of me and wraps his arms around my waist , then leans his head forward until his forehead rests against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come to bed , ' ' he whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] a thrill of pleasure runs through me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know how long i ' ve wanted to hear you say that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins widely and presses his lips against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to our recent urgent caress ##es , this one is slow and gentle . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps because we know we ' re finally on the same page , and we have all night to spend with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue delicately flick ##s against mine , and i feel his hands move under my ass and pick me up . [SEP]
[CLS] he spins and walks to the bed , setting me down in a seated position on the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is there anything . . . in particular you want tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want you , ' ' i reply with a shrug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that i can do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grabs the bottom of his t - shirt and pulls it off over his head . [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip . [SEP]
[CLS] the tight ##ness and size of his muscles always takes me aback . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean forward and nu ##zzle my nose into the hair just under his belly button , then softly kiss him . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear a low grunt from the back of his throat and lean back to look at him questioning ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s looking down at me like he ' s about to dev ##our me in one bite , but he takes a deep breath and knee ##ls down in front of me , spreading my knees apart so he can push right up against me . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me toward him and opens my lips with his . [SEP]
[CLS] as our tongues meet , i feel his fingertips gliding softly over the top of my cam ##iso ##le , barely touching my right breast . [SEP]
[CLS] i press forward into his hand , but he pulls back . [SEP]
[CLS] i quickly learn my lesson and stay still as his fingers return , teasing ##ly running just under the fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] finally i feel him reach up with both hands and pull the cotton down and hook it under my breasts so it stays put . [SEP]
[CLS] he dip ##s his head and pulls my breasts together , taking one nipple into his mouth and sucking on it , then quickly moving over to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan and tilt my head back as my hands grip the comfort ##er beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] he backs off and takes the bottom hem of my shirt , pulling it off over my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have the most gorgeous breasts , ' ' he breathe ##s , palm ##ing them as though he ' s sc ##ul ##pt ##ing clay . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve always been self - conscious of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looks at me in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re perfect . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leans forward to kiss me softly , then begins to un ##bu ##tton his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , um , can i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stop him . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles at me and stands . [SEP]
[CLS] i slowly reach forward and finish un ##bu ##tton ##ing them , then move the zipper down . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his eyes on me , but i keep my gaze on what i know is waiting for me underneath his denim . [SEP]
[CLS] the arch of his cock is pressing against his boxer - briefs as i push his jeans past his knees . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause and then take the sides of his waistband and pull them out and around . [SEP]
[CLS] his thick mushroom tip springs out as soon i pull the boxers down . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s so big that i ca n ' t begin to imagine how he ' s going to fit inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] my worry must read on my face , because he says , ` ` we ' ll take it slow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod and push the boxers down to his jeans , holding them as he steps out of them . [SEP]
[CLS] i gulp as i ' m face - to - face again with his man ##hood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you ever . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks leading ##ly , nodding down at himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me your hands . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , reaching up to place mine in his large outstretched palms . [SEP]
[CLS] he places one on his thigh , and brings the other to his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] he wraps it around the base , and then moves it up to his tip , then back down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just like that . [SEP]
[CLS] nice and easy at first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he removes his hand and i keep going , feeling the soft , vein ##y skin of his cock ripple slightly at my touch . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes my other hand and places it on his balls , mass ##aging them with me . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands then drop by his sides , and i look up to see his eyes closing and his lips parting . [SEP]
[CLS] instinctively , i lean forward and , tucking my lips over my teeth , i take him inside my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him gasp and i smile inwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t know that i ' ve read my fair share of dirty books , even if i ' ve never actually put anything into practice . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep moving my mouth down his length , seeing how far in i can take him . [SEP]
[CLS] i stop when he hits the back wall of my mouth , though i ' m still not at his base , and then begin to slide back out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , fuck , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] you sure you ' ve never done this before ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks me , eyes wide as i swirl my tongue around his tip and then pull him back inside my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i move my hand back to his balls and massage him again as i move up and down his dick . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him moan and feel his hand move to the back of my head , his fingers grasping my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` enough , ' ' he grunt ##s , pulling his hips back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stand up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] normally when nate takes that tone with me or orders me around , it really gets under my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] but right now , it ' s turning me the hell on . [SEP]
[CLS] i jump to my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] he abruptly takes the elastic waist of my pants and yank ##s them to the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] we stand facing each other naked , the air between us charged . [SEP]
[CLS] without taking his eyes off mine , he reaches forward and between my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out softly as he slips one finger over my wet clit , and then inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost fall forward at the strength of my reaction to his touch , and have to grab onto his shoulders to support myself . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me into him so that i ' m curled against his chest , my head resting just under his chin . [SEP]
[CLS] his finger moves in and out of me , and his thumb flick ##s over my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach down and begin to run my hand up and down his cock like he showed me , though i ' m so turned on that i ' m hardly aware of what i ' m doing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re almost ready , ' ' he whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls his hand out of me and picks me up under the arm ##pit ##s and toss ##es me onto the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] in a second he ' s pushing my legs apart and kneeling between them . [SEP]
[CLS] his head ducks down and i buck wildly as his tongue takes a long lick of my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him slip two fingers inside me , and can feel him pressing them all around , stretching me out . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue circles and flick ##s against me the whole time , until i begin to un ##rave ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , nate , oh , yes ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out , but he stops . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp at the sudden lack of contact and pick up my head to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s no longer between my legs , but standing to get something out of his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles at me as he shows me the condoms he ' s taking out of his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] he rip ##s one off and pulls it open with his teeth , then toss ##es the rest on the bed next to me as he walks back . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch as he holds it to his tip and then un ##roll ##s it down his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] then he knee ##ls back on the bed , his legs between mine , and lies down on top of me with his weight on his elbows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this first time will probably hurt a little , but it ' ll feel good soon , ' ' he promises , brushing a strand of hair behind my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses me , his tongue softly caressing mine , as i feel his dick against my opening . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe it ' s finally happening . [SEP]
[CLS] he reaches down , pulling my leg up and holding it against his hip as he takes his cock in his other hand , positioning it at just the right angle . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as he enters me and sharp pain rev ##er ##ber ##ates through my entire lower half . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hips stop their forward motion . [SEP]
[CLS] he moves his mouth over to my ear , softly sucking on my earl ##obe and darting his tongue in and out as he moves forward again . [SEP]
[CLS] the pleas ##urable sensation at my ear helps to distract me from the massive pressure i feel pressing into me . [SEP]
[CLS] i close my eyes and wrap my arms around his back , willing myself to relax . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i ' m in good hands . [SEP]
[CLS] just when i think the pain will be more than i can handle , he stops , and i can feel the skin around his hips pressing against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s all the way in . [SEP]
[CLS] he circles around slowly , and i feel my first twin ##ge of pleasure at the sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls his head back and looks at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , feeling breathless . [SEP]
[CLS] without taking his eyes off me , he begins to pull back out , all the way to his tip , before sliding in again . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls out a second time , and as he returns , my lips part in surprise at my body ' s response . [SEP]
[CLS] i think he can sense that i ' m starting to warm to the sensation , because he begins to move a little faster . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , nate , that feels . . . it feels . . . ' ' i trail off . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no words . [SEP]
[CLS] i simply wrap my legs around his back and dig my hands into his hair as he moves against me , as exquisite waves flow through my body . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips find mine again , kissing me with a passion that matches the faster pace he ' s setting . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve had orgasm ##s before , including an amazing one with nate , but this one feels different . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s so powerful that it scares me . [SEP]
[CLS] i bear down against it , holding my breath to keep it at bay . [SEP]
[CLS] but everything nate is doing is working against me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hands move to my breasts , and my back arches against the heat of his palms . [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses my neck as i bend to him , and his cock finds new and untouched nerve endings to drive me to the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , nate , it ' s too much . . . ' ' i breathe , opening my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know if i can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he slow ##s down for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , you ' re safe with me , ' ' he murmurs , his dark eyes finding mine , tenderness and passion mixed in them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just have to let go . [SEP]
[CLS] let go with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he begins to speed up , but his eyes do n ' t leave mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i follow his advice , trying to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to control it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , yes , bryn ##n , ' ' he grunt ##s as my eyes roll back in my head . [SEP]
[CLS] he slams his hips into me now , driving his cock inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear myself begin to moan as though i ' m outside of my own body . [SEP]
[CLS] his torso lifts off of me and he thrusts in a little deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] the slightly new angle is enough to push me right over the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] i completely lose control , my body arching with spa ##sms of its own accord . [SEP]
[CLS] i can vaguely feel him buck ##ing on top of me , his sweat dripping down onto my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] he collapses on top of me and i tuck my face into his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] his body weight feels exactly right on top of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like i could stay like this forever . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - one i wake up to soft kisses on my cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes flutter open in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i murmur inc ##oh ##ere ##ntly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you passed out , ' ' i hear nate whisper back . [SEP]
[CLS] i realize he ' s still on top of me - and inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sorry , ' ' i smile , blushing a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope i did n ' t make too much noise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i think if they ' d heard anything , we would have known about it by now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how long was i asleep for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just twenty minutes or so . [SEP]
[CLS] i was worried i was going to crush you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses my lips and then reaches down . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch him hold the base of the condom as he pulls out of me . [SEP]
[CLS] the sensation of him leaving my body is jar ##ring , and i lay still for another minute , absorbing it , as he walks to the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he comes back with a couple of wet tissues and i sit up to take them from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lie back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , and feel him carefully wiping up the inside of my thigh , and then begin to giggle . [SEP]
[CLS] he stops and looks at me with a confused frown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i just - i never thought i ' d be in this position with nate thorn ##hill ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i explain . [SEP]
[CLS] he shakes his head with a be ##mus ##ed grin as i continue to giggle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you bled a little , but it did n ' t get on the comfort ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] that would have been tough to explain , ' ' he says as he returns to the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could have just said i had my period , ' ' i point out as i pull my comfort ##er back and crawl underneath the sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i guess that ' s true , ' ' he says , coming back and sliding into bed next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe i ' m not a virgin anymore , ' ' i grin as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was beginning to think it would never happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . you liked it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , running his fingers up and down my arm . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m shocked to feel my body respond hung ##rily , as though i have n ' t just had a mind - blowing orgasm twenty minutes ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you kidding me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , raising my eyebrows at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about me ? [SEP]
[CLS] was i . . . ' ' ` ` you were excellent , ' ' he assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was different , though . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` different , how ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i usually do n ' t really know the girls i sleep with . [SEP]
[CLS] or have feelings for them . [SEP]
[CLS] even the ones i get to know , because we ' re hook ##ing up regularly , i ' ll end it when they get too cl ##ing ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a fis ##sure of concern rises in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . do n ' t get cl ##ing ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was n ' t a warning , ' ' he says , turning to me with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , i do n ' t think of you as cl ##ing ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] stubborn , maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gee , thanks , ' ' i reply , rolling my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , why did it never happen ? [SEP]
[CLS] losing your virginity ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , turning to me and resting his head on his elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i guess it ' s not that surprising . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never really dated . [SEP]
[CLS] my first kiss was with this guy david in my junior year of high school . [SEP]
[CLS] it was really fast . [SEP]
[CLS] and gross . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue just sort of darted in and out of my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] and then senior year , and freshman year of college , a few guys took me out , but it never really went anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , they were fine , but i really wanted to de ##dicate myself to studying , and getting a scholarship and all that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did your mom put a lot of pressure on you to do well in school ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the opposite , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] she was always begging me to get my head out of a book and put on some lip gloss . [SEP]
[CLS] which of course just made me want to stick my head even further into a book . [SEP]
[CLS] i just never wanted to end up like her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate raises his eyebrows at me , and i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , dependent on men . [SEP]
[CLS] she never really learned how to do anything because she ' s so beautiful and charming and men would always do everything for her . [SEP]
[CLS] but when i came along , they stopped coming around so much , and she had to take care of me all by herself . [SEP]
[CLS] and even when they did , they ' d eventually leave , and she ' d be devastated . [SEP]
[CLS] curled up in bed for days , depressed , unable to care for herself . . . ' ' ` ` so then you started taking care of her , ' ' he finishes . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] we settle back into the pillows for a minute . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your mom should have known that not all books are created equal , though , ' ' nate begins thoughtfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` some are far more interesting than others . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , with absolutely no idea what he ' s talking about . [SEP]
[CLS] with a devil ##ish grin , he reaches over me and opens my bedside table . [SEP]
[CLS] i shriek and grab his arm as i see his fingers graz ##e over my copy of lady chatter ##ley ' s lover . [SEP]
[CLS] but to my far more infinite horror , his hand keeps searching back and returns to the bed with my hot pink vi ##bra ##tor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , put that back ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ignores me , and studies it thoughtfully as my cheeks burn . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` someday i ' d like to watch you use this on yourself , ' ' he comments . [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth drops open and he glances up at me , his eyes boring into me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think about that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i do n ' t know , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not tonight , ' ' he assure ##s me , replacing the vi ##bra ##tor in the drawer and turning back to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tonight , i ' ll do all the work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as i feel his fingers slip between my legs and rub against my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have no idea how much it turns me on to be your first for all of this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm ##hm , ' ' i reply distracted ##ly as my eyelids flutter . [SEP]
[CLS] no way can i concentrate on speaking with his hand down there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , keep looking at me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i w ##hine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i like to tease you , ' ' he replies simply . [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip and turn my head back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers rub my aching nu ##b over and over again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like it when you order me around , ' ' i whisper , feeling shocked to hear myself say such a thing out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes widen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only in bed , ' ' i explain . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch his pupils dil ##ate and his jaw muscles contract , as though he ' s struggling against some powerful reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] he sucks in a breath of air and then blows it out of his mouth slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n , there are so many things i want to do to you . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ca n ' t just jump from zero to sixty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod in understanding and then moan as he slips a finger inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so wet already . [SEP]
[CLS] you want round two ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] all i can do is moan in af ##firm ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` turn around , ' ' he orders me , and a thrill of desire rushes through me . [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , turning over onto my other side so that my back ' s to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he runs his hand over my ass and then back between my legs and inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him fu ##mbling with his other hand and then the sound of a condom being ripped open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` put your arms over your head , ' ' he tells me . [SEP]
[CLS] i place them over my ears and onto the pillow , bending my elbows so that they do n ' t hit the head ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hand press down against my forearms , his long fingers easily reaching completely around me , and pinning me to the pillow . [SEP]
[CLS] his other hand slides out of me and pulls my hips back toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to tremble with anticipation , but do n ' t have to wait very long . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his cock at my slit , pushing into me as he holds me in place . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out from pain and pleasure as he re ##awa ##ken ##s the sore ##ness he created the first time , but unlike that time , the pleasure is also instant and intense . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his mouth at my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , oh god , yes , ' ' i moan . [SEP]
[CLS] he thrusts into me faster . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so hard to hold back with you , ' ' he mutter ##s , almost to himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him grunt in response and slam into me harder . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly i feel myself being picked up and turned over . [SEP]
[CLS] before i know it , i ' m on my hands and knees without nate and me ever losing contact . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to bite my lip to keep myself from screaming out in pleasure as he pulls out and drives back in . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s in so deep now , pressing directly against my g - spot with every thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] my body begins to shake with another orgasm and this time , i let myself go with it . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel nate ' s hands pulling my hips back to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me . [SEP]
[CLS] my elbows collapse down with the final shudder of my orgasm , and nate lands on top of me , immediately kissing the back of my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n , i ' m sorry , ' ' he murmurs , as he pulls my hair out of my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry ? [SEP]
[CLS] why are you sorry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , be ##fu ##ddled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re crying . . . i ' m so sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i was too rough , i went too quickly , i - ' ' he rushes on , sounding horrified . [SEP]
[CLS] my brain tries to catch up with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t even realize i was crying . [SEP]
[CLS] everything felt amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his body relax ##es against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was so scared for a second there . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought i hurt you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , honestly . . . ' ' i reach up to touch my face , and he ' s right - my cheeks are damp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s so strange . [SEP]
[CLS] this does n ' t happen a lot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls himself up so he can look at me with an ironic grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do try not to make girls cry , bryn ##n . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i just meant . . . i wondered if this happens to other girls . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose i do n ' t usually . . . you know , let go of control like that . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe the emotional release . . . ' ' ` ` maybe . [SEP]
[CLS] just as long as you ' re ok . ' ' ` ` i ' m more than ok , ' ' i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sore ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll get you some water , ' ' he says , kissing the back of my shoulder before gently pulling out of me . [SEP]
[CLS] he comes back from the bathroom with a glass for me , and sits up in bed with me as i drink it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish you could sleep here , ' ' i murmur , resting my head on his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel spent , relaxed . . . and happy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - two the next morning , i wake up reaching for nate , but he ' s gone . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn over onto my back in frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit , become more manage ##able , but it ' s even stronger now . [SEP]
[CLS] even though i can feel a little sore ##ness and pain between my legs , i want him to take me again , and again , and again . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at the clock and am shocked to see it ' s almost noon . [SEP]
[CLS] well , i guess i did have a big day yesterday , between almost sliding down that cliff and losing my virginity . [SEP]
[CLS] i slide under the sheets to the side of the bed and sit up on the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] i roll my ankle and find that there ' s barely any pain , though i guess i should leave the tape on for one more day just to be safe . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t - shirt and head downstairs to the kitchen and fix myself some breakfast . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom walks in just as i ' m sitting down at the breakfast table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , that ' s a lot of food , bryn ##n , ' ' she comments , raising her eyebrows at the amount of eggs and toast on my plate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` starving , ' ' i reply , pausing only momentarily then continuing to shovel food into my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can see that . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s your ankle ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lot better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i clear my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to stop acting weird or my mom will know something ' s up . [SEP]
[CLS] i put down my fork . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you have a nice lunch with pierce yesterday ? [SEP]
[CLS] where ' d you go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the palm , ' ' she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was lovely . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce is a regular there and always gets the best table . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up as nate slides opens the door from outside . [SEP]
[CLS] he wink ##s at me and i quickly bury my head back in my food so that my mom ca n ' t see the blush spreading across my cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just returning from your morning workout , nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks as she begins to fix herself some tea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re both getting such late starts today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` must ' ve been that hike , ' ' nate replies non ##chal ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s your ankle ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lot better , ' ' i repeat , holding it out from under the table and rolling it around to demonstrate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` better keep the tape on for another day just to be safe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s just what i was thinking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anybody want some coffee ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just putting some water on , ' ' my mom breaks in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , please , ' ' we both chorus . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i ' m so glad you two are getting along . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' step ' word has such a bad con ##not ##ation , i suppose because of cinderella . . . you know , the wicked steps ##ister ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , having a bigger family can be such a positive thing , ' ' she muse ##s , turning up the burn ##er on the stove ##top . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch her for a moment , wondering if she ' s trying to bring up something about what i said to her last night , about how she needs to get involved in pierce ' s harsh treatment of his son . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` very positive , ' ' nate replies seriously , not looking at me as i glare at him warning ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] it is so not the time for one of his smart ##ass comments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce and i are going to the farmer ' s market in about an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] you guys want to come ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and miss a chance to be alone with nate ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was thinking i was just going to sit by the pool today , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give my ankle a little more time to heal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably wise , ' ' my mom agrees . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about you , nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to , um . . . ' ' he trails off , trying to come up with an excuse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i think my friend jackson might swing by later , so i better stay home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , just the parents then , ' ' my mom with a faux sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] nate and my mom both leave the kitchen to take their coffee into other rooms , so i can finish off my breakfast in peace . [SEP]
[CLS] after i clean up my plates , i decide to head into the den and turn on the tv . [SEP]
[CLS] my body needs to digest that giant breakfast i just dev ##oured . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce and my mom find me sitting in there on their way out the door , and i wave goodbye . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as the door closes , a ball of excitement forms in my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m alone with nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like a kid on christmas morning . [SEP]
[CLS] i push aside the throw and stand up , heading for the stairs and nate ' s bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] a flu ##rry of nerves hits me as i walk down the hallway and knock softly on his door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one sec ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he calls back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , come in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i push the door open to find him standing just outside his bathroom , a white towel wrapped around his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s dripping wet , having clearly just stepped out of the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , it ' s you , ' ' he says with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] i shut the door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they just left . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you feeling , really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i want to make sure i did n ' t go too fast last night . [SEP]
[CLS] any regrets ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i walk toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do have one regret . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he frowns in concern , his beautiful forehead marred by a line in between his eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there was something i wanted to do last night , but i did n ' t get the chance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the tension immediately leaves his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which was ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , the edge of his mouth twisting up in a questioning smile . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach forward and un ##wr ##ap his towel in response , then knee ##l in front of him . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch his cock grow hard in front of my eyes as he gazes down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , i run my hands up the front of his thighs , feeling his leg hair under my palms disappear as it reaches the line of his hips . [SEP]
[CLS] i lean forward , trailing kisses just under his belly button . [SEP]
[CLS] he smells amazing - a head ##y mixture of fresh shower combined with the very personal scent of his package . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s unlike anything i ' ve smelled before , and though i have n ' t been with anyone else , i bet the smell is all his own . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my hands around the back of his thighs as i dip my head and kiss the base of his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] his cock jumps slightly in response to my touch , and i hear him groan . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my hand around him , pulling him toward my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i circle my tongue lightly around his tip , licking up a bea ##d of liquid that has just appeared there . [SEP]
[CLS] i move to the base of his dick , pressing my tongue down hard as i make my way back up the underside of his shaft , then flick my tongue around his tip . [SEP]
[CLS] then i tuck my lips around my teeth and wrap them around him , stretching my mouth wide to receive him . [SEP]
[CLS] i move slowly down his length , wanting to make him feel as good as he ' s been making me feel . [SEP]
[CLS] and to tease him a little , too , if i ' m being perfectly honest . [SEP]
[CLS] i look up at him as i pull back , and see him biting his lip as he looks down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i circle his tip with my tongue for a minute as he watches me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel myself growing wet - why going down on him turns me on so much i do n ' t know , but it does . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers wrap around the back of my head , digging into my hair , as he dip ##s his head back . [SEP]
[CLS] i take him in my mouth again and begin to move faster . [SEP]
[CLS] i bring one hand up to massage his balls , and wrap the other around his shaft , following my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i still ca n ' t fit his whole cock in my mouth , so i figure this is kind of a good cheat . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes begin to water a bit as i hear him begin to groan . [SEP]
[CLS] i move even faster , excited to feel him come in my mouth , and to taste him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , fuck , fuck , i ' m coming , ' ' he moans , and suddenly my mouth is filled with liquid . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep moving my head back and forth even as i feel it leak a little out of the corner of my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] should i swallow it ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know what else to do , so i lean back for a moment and feel it run down my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s taking deep breaths above me , his chest heaving , so i lean forward again and kiss his shaft gently as it soft ##ens a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess i expected it to , you know , go down right away , but it stays mostly erect as i stand back up . [SEP]
[CLS] to my surprise , he wraps his arms around me and kisses me . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought he might feel some com ##pu ##nction considering where my mouth has been , but his tongue slips readily against mine and i relax against him . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand slides down my ass and he rubs himself against me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how much longer do you think they ' ll be gone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks breaking away and bringing his other hand up to my cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' ll make this quick , just in case . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pushes me away and steps back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` strip . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i almost gasp at the pleasure his command sends rushing through me . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull off my shirt and yoga pants , then un ##ho ##ok my bra and slide my panties to the ground as he watches . [SEP]
[CLS] my lips part as he wraps his hand around his cock as it harden ##s completely again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to go on birth control soon , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to have to wear a condom with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does it feel very different ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] and i want to feel myself right up against you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walks over to his bedside table and pulls a condom out and toss ##es it on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come , ' ' he says , holding his hand out to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk over , and he turns me around , pulling my back against him . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his cock hitting the small of my back as he runs his fingers over my stomach and then up over my breasts , gently pinch ##ing my nipples . [SEP]
[CLS] i groan into his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never felt anything close to the way he makes me feel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a little faster and harder this time , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , and i nod , already beyond speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers slide down and over my clit , and i can hear the sounds of my wet ##ness as he presses one finger inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re already so wet . . . good girl . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his other hand snakes up to my face and turns my cheek so that i ' m facing him . [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses me , hard , his tongue ra ##va ##ging my mouth as his finger circles inside my opening . [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb flick ##s over my clit and i cry out in pleasure and surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] as if he were just waiting for this response , he turns me around and pushes me down on my back on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he picks up the condom next to me and quickly rip ##s it open and pulls it on . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabs my hips and steps forward , pulling my ass down so that it ' s just on the edge of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he bends over me , quickly pulling my breast into his mouth and gently ni ##bbling on my nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] he moves his weight onto his elbows and i feel him pressing inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a slight sore ##ness left over from last night , but also instant pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] he stretches me open , pushing slowly but surely until he ' s all the way in . [SEP]
[CLS] my hands dig into his back as he thrusts again , a little harder . [SEP]
[CLS] then he stands up , still inside me , and pulls my legs up so that my calves are resting on his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] he moves his right hand over my crotch , and i moan as he begins to circle my clit with his thumb . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out as he begins to pull in and out of me at the same time , and i watch his face as he watches himself move inside my opening . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of his fingers on my clit and his cock inside me is quickly driving me crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` aa ##gg ##h , ' ' i cry out intel ##li ##gi ##bly , and nate ' s eyes snap up to my face . [SEP]
[CLS] he removes his hand from my clit and leans forward so that both of his palms are spread on the comfort ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] my legs are still on his shoulders , and i can feel a good stretch in my ham ##st ##ring ##s in this position . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m also completely im ##mo ##bil ##ized as he begins to drive into me in earnest now , his jaw tense and his neck muscles bulging . [SEP]
[CLS] i close my eyes and lose myself to the sensation of being drilled over and over again . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s hitting me so deeply , and i ' m absolutely out of control and powerless . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it would make me nervous with some other man , but i feel completely safe with nate . [SEP]
[CLS] as an orgasm begins to rip through me , i feel his hands gripping my shoulders tightly , pulling me down against him as he comes inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , oh , fuck , bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shouts as he releases himself . [SEP]
[CLS] my legs fall off his shoulders and sp ##lay onto the comfort ##er as he collapses on top of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp for air , and dr ##ows ##ily wipe the hair out of my face as i feel him stir on top of me . [SEP]
[CLS] he picks his head up and listen ##s for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re still not home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm , guess not , ' ' i murmur rather inc ##oh ##ere ##ntly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , ' ' he says with a wicked smile , and begins to kiss down the middle of my chest as he slides to his knees on the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , what are you - oh , god , ' ' i moan , as he takes a long lick of my slit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t wait until tonight to taste you again . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like i ' m addicted to this , to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i close my eyes as he begins to flick his tongue across my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought i was completely worn out , but i ' m coming back to life shocking ##ly quickly under his def ##t tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands pin my knees to the sides of the bed , stretching me wide open so that he has complete access and control . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his tongue dart in and out of me - a completely different sensation than when he uses his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches off the bed as he moves back to my clit , circling it relentless ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i whimper as i feel waves of pleasure begin to rev ##er ##ber ##ate through my body . [SEP]
[CLS] my body wants to rock and shake , but nate ' s hands pin me firmly to the bed , and his tongue keeps flicking across me . [SEP]
[CLS] my energy has no choice but to be completely directed to the reaction he ' s eli ##cit ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , it ' s when nate backs off slightly that my body rocks into a full - out orgasm , my back arching wildly off the bed , just the top of my head and my hips remaining in contact with the comfort ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , ' ' i breathe as i relax down . [SEP]
[CLS] i lift my head slightly and watch him lick his lips before lying down next to me on the bed and la ##zily flop ##ping an arm over my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should get dressed , ' ' he reminds me , kissing me quickly before jumping back up . [SEP]
[CLS] i groan . [SEP]
[CLS] where ' s he getting all this energy ? [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like i could sleep for days . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think there will ever be a day when we can tell them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask with a ya ##wn as i sit up . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses for a moment as he pulls open a dresser drawer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s just keep it our secret for now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no , i was n ' t saying i - ' ' i break off as we both hear a car pulling up to the front of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry over to the pile of my clothes and ball them up in my arms before running to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you later ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call quietly over my shoulder as i dash naked down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] as i shut my door behind me and begin pulling on my clothes , i wonder why nate was so quick to suggest that we keep it quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i want something different - for now , at least . [SEP]
[CLS] but someday . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , does he just en ##vision keeping our relationship secret forever ? [SEP]
[CLS] what kind of relationship would that be , anyway ? [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] these kind of questions are what allison warned me about in the first place . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . fuck . [SEP]
[CLS] what was once a far - off crush has become real for me . [SEP]
[CLS] too real . [SEP]
[CLS] and nate has said he has feelings for me , that i ' m different , but he has n ' t been any more specific than that . [SEP]
[CLS] on my end , i do n ' t think this is a purely sexual in ##fat ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m really falling for him . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - three going to work this week and being away from nate during the day has felt like going through physical withdrawal . [SEP]
[CLS] i really have to force myself to focus , because sometimes i find myself staring off into the distance , remembering what he did to me the previous night . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could just go straight home at six today , but i promised allison i ' d go shopping with her . [SEP]
[CLS] and there are actually a couple things i ' d like to pick up for myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i meet her at the ant ##hr ##op ##olo ##gie in georgetown mall , and we start going through the sale racks as we catch up . [SEP]
[CLS] while she ' s not looking , i slip a couple sets of linger ##ie and sexy bra ##s into my basket . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to wear something a little sexy for nate , but i do n ' t want to face allison ' s inevitable questions if she sees what i ' ve picked out . [SEP]
[CLS] we eventually make our way to the changing rooms and begin trying on our choices . [SEP]
[CLS] i quickly slip on the first matching set of bra and panties . [SEP]
[CLS] i admire myself in the mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] the lace is a pale violet , and not over ##tly sexy - it ' s ant ##hr ##op ##olo ##gie , not victoria ' s secret , after all . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison asks suddenly , pulling the curtain aside and stepping into the dressing room with me . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s wearing a blue cotton dress and t ##wi ##rl ##s for a second before she realizes what i ' m wearing . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyebrows raise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` allison , ' ' i groan , pulling one of the more substantial pieces of clothing off a hang ##er to cover myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , i had a feeling something was different with you , ' ' she says , beginning to smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yu ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] and i was right . [SEP]
[CLS] i always thought you two would make a good match . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not what you said . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i totally called it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you completely warned me against the whole thing , ' ' i reply , confused and even slightly annoyed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , ' ' she says with a frown , ` ` who are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` greg , obviously . . . ' ' ` ` oh , right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n . . . ' ' ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask innocent ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if it ' s not greg , who did you think i was talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , her eyes widening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not important , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , blushing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , no . [SEP]
[CLS] please tell me it ' s not nate . [SEP]
[CLS] please . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , he ' s your step ##bro ##ther . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s . . . it ' s gross . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks a lot , allison . [SEP]
[CLS] not exactly what i needed to hear right now , ' ' i snap , turning my back to her to pull off the linger ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , maybe it ' s exactly what you need to hear right now . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , what ' s with you ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re ignoring a perfectly nice guy to go out with some jock like nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , first of all , it ' s none of your business . [SEP]
[CLS] second of all , you ' re actually completely right about greg . [SEP]
[CLS] he is ' perfectly nice . ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no spark at all . [SEP]
[CLS] zero . [SEP]
[CLS] third of all , nate ' s not ' some jock . ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s really smart , and kind , and funny . [SEP]
[CLS] and with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] sparks gal ##ore ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , bryn ##n , i ' m just trying to look out for you . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re making some really bad decisions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath , not wanting to raise my voice in this public place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , allison , you ' re not trying to look out for me . [SEP]
[CLS] what you ' re doing is judging me . [SEP]
[CLS] completely different . [SEP]
[CLS] and i really do n ' t appreciate it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i finish pulling on my skirt and quickly slip my flats on as i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk straight out of the store and toward the elevator to the parking garage , my cheeks burning with anger , though i also feel a bit like crying . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never had a big fight like that with allison before , and i do n ' t like it . [SEP]
[CLS] i freeze outside another store just as i ' m about to reach the elevators . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s secret . [SEP]
[CLS] my relationship with nate is n ' t ` ` gross . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s nothing wrong with what we ' re doing . [SEP]
[CLS] if anything , my conversation with allison has made me want to lean into my relationship with nate , not out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] i march in and straight to the ra ##cies ##t pieces i see . [SEP]
[CLS] when i get home , i hear my mom and pierce laughing in the kitchen , and the tv from the den . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk in there and smile in relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] he moves his legs over and i pl ##op down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' i murmur with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i frown at him , and he reaches up to his shoulder , mimi ##ng pulling at something . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him for a moment before realizing he ' s mirror ##ing my own action of pulling at my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh and drop my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s allison . [SEP]
[CLS] we had an argument , ' ' i explain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she . . . she found out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he cock ##s his head and then lets out a low whistle as he realizes what i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i suppose it ' s not that bad . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i always thought . . . ' ' he lowers his voice , looking back toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i always thought that at school , we could be more open . [SEP]
[CLS] no one really knows you ' re my steps ##ister there . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , allison would have found out then anyway , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess so . . . she just . . . she called it ' gross . ' [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re not , are we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i certainly do n ' t think there ' s anything gross about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s more than that , though . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like we ' re drifting apart a little , ' ' i reveal , swallowing a ball of hurt in my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm , ' ' he replies , considering . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like me and jackson , sort of . [SEP]
[CLS] well , maybe you wo n ' t be quite as close as you were , but there are still things you can enjoy about her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when ' d you get so wise ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , nu ##d ##ging his feet next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since i started hanging out with you . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re rubbing off on me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before i have time to consider whether he ' s being serious or not , we hear my mom call , ` ` dinner ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] from the kitchen , and are forced to put our conversation on hold . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal , for which i ' m grateful . [SEP]
[CLS] not for his sake , but for nate ' s , because he ' s much less likely to snap at his son when he ' s feeling jo ##vial . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we have n ' t made an official announcement , bryn ##n , but thorn ##hill and co . has just landed mark broad ##man as a client , ' ' he reveals eventually . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the hedge fund billionaire ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] he has several new holdings , and needs advice on some public policy matters . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , that ' s huge . [SEP]
[CLS] cong ##rat ##s , dad , ' ' nate chi ##mes in . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce nods at him in a self - satisfied manner . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad it ' s all - i ' m glad that ' s happened , pierce , ' ' i correct myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost referenced the scandal earlier this summer , but managed to change course . [SEP]
[CLS] we never talk about it now , though i know that pierce was concerned that it would negatively impact his business . [SEP]
[CLS] but landing such a big client is a good sign that people have moved on , and are on pierce ' s side . [SEP]
[CLS] after dinner , nate and i leave the dining room separately , while our parents remain there chatting . [SEP]
[CLS] we always make a show of going our separate ways , to keep up appearances . [SEP]
[CLS] i close my bedroom door knowing that he ' ll come for me around midnight , as he has every night this past week . [SEP]
[CLS] my body quiver ##s with excitement just thinking about it . [SEP]
[CLS] i consider writing an email to allison , but decide i want a little more time to think about what to say . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to my purse and pull out the bag from victoria ' s secret that i stuffed to the bottom . [SEP]
[CLS] i touch the black lace panties , a narrow diamond - shaped piece of fabric that just covers the essential ##s , with several thin strips , string , really , hook ##ing around my hips and latch ##ing on to the back . [SEP]
[CLS] the bra is conservative by contrast , though pretty with its chant ##illy lace - covered cups . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of tea . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m taking a mug down from the top cupboard when i feel nate come up behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] he wraps his hands around my waist and presses against me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , not here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , i ' m sorry , ' ' he murmurs in my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want you all the time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have a surprise for you tonight , ' ' i admit . [SEP]
[CLS] he grind ##s his erection into my ass in response , his hands reaching under my shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re killing me , ' ' he moans , then sighs , and rests his head on mine before pulling away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you soon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i lean against the counter as i hear him retreat , my skin tingling where he ' s touched it . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that sneaking around wo n ' t work forever , but for now , there ' s something so hot about it . [SEP]
[CLS] i take my dec ##af earl grey up to my room , and change into the linger ##ie as i drink it , carefully pulling out the tags . [SEP]
[CLS] i sink into bed with a ya ##wn , pulling the sheet up over me . [SEP]
[CLS] these late night assign ##ations , while i would n ' t give them up for anything , are wr ##eak ##ing havoc on my sleep schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] the next thing i know , i ' m being woken up by someone sinking into bed next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn into the warmth of nate ' s body and slowly open my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , should i just let you sleep ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , kissing the top of my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no way , ' ' i reply dr ##ows ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to have your surprise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , looking around . [SEP]
[CLS] i lift my arm and point down at my body . [SEP]
[CLS] he grins , and pinch ##es the top of the sheet in his fingers and begins to slowly pull it down . [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip as i hear his sharp intake of breath as he reveals my bra . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses , looking up at my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s more , ' ' i promise him . [SEP]
[CLS] he keeps pulling the sheet down , and finally pulls it over the barely - there panties . [SEP]
[CLS] he toss ##es the sheet at my feet and runs his hand from my knee up my inner thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what shall i do with you tonight , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , eyeing my linger ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever you want , ' ' i breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stand up , ' ' he says abruptly . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand , and he eyes me up and down , licking his lips , then narrows his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have any high shoes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean heels ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` put them on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i walk over to my closet and slip them on , then walk back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` better ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , turning a little so he can see me from other angles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing could make you look any better than you already do , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t about your appearance , it was about your height . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i frown at him in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come here , ' ' he says , walking over to the bed ##post nearest to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] i follow him . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes me by the hips and moves me so that my back is pressed up against it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you remember what happened in this exact spot ? [SEP]
[CLS] the first time i tried to kiss you , you denied me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember how much self - control it took . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good answer . [SEP]
[CLS] stay there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walks over to my bureau and rum ##mage ##s around until he pulls out a couple of my old t - shirts and then walks back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` close your eyes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , and feel him wrap one of the shirts around my head , tying it in the back but slightly to the side , so that it does n ' t hit the bed post . [SEP]
[CLS] as he steps back , i try to open my eyes to test the blind ##fold , and find i ca n ' t see anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you trust me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hands behind your back . [SEP]
[CLS] grip the bed ##post . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my insides clench as i obey , spreading my palms against the solid wood of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , i feel the other t - shirt wrapping around both my wrists and the posts , holding me securely against it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pull against it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i try , but do n ' t get anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i can sense him leaning in toward me , and feel the heat em ##ana ##ting from his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , tonight i ' m going to make you beg for it , understand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his warm breath against my cheek and sq ##ui ##rm in anticipation against my bond ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to deny you until you ca n ' t take it anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] until you beg me . [SEP]
[CLS] say that you understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s barely touched me , and i can already feel how wet i am against my new panties . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly , i feel his fingertips on my arm , just above where the t - shirt is holding me to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he trails his fingers lightly up my arm , barely touching me . [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth drops open and i feel my heart rate speed up . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers continue across my cl ##avi ##cle , then down my other arm . [SEP]
[CLS] as they make their way back up , i attempt to arch against him , but i ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] he stops for a moment , then continues , his touch leaving a burning trail across my body . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers run straight down my chest and over the middle of my bra . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i think he ' s going to skip my breasts entirely , he moves back up and barely graz ##es the tops of my breasts , just above the cups . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as he makes contact , but he quickly moves away , running his fingers down to my rib ##ca ##ge , then across my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] they dip for a moment into my belly button , and i hope he ' s going to continue down to my panties , but he skip ##s them entirely , jumping down to the top of my thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] he traces the length of one of my legs , then moves to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] as his fingers reach the top of my left leg , he breaks off contact . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel sweat collect on my palms , despite the cool ##ness of my bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] where is he ? [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly i feel his breath on my neck . [SEP]
[CLS] then his tongue is inside my ear , taking a long , lang ##uid lick . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan , and my hands grip the bed ##post more tightly . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him click his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , we ' ve barely even started . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i let my head fall back against the bed ##post . [SEP]
[CLS] how long is he going to torture me ? [SEP]
[CLS] as if in response , his hand slides up my neck to my chin , holding my face in place . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips press against mine , roughly opening my mouth to his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] then he steps into me , his legs spreading mine open , his arms wrapping tightly around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] the full contact is sweet relief , even if it does make me want him even more . [SEP]
[CLS] his right hand glide ##s over my ass and pulls me against his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth is wide open to his , and our tongues massage each other ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] his other hand glide ##s up my stomach and slips under my bra cup . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan as i feel his call ##ouse ##d palm against my nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls his mouth away quickly and leans his torso back . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers brush against the front of my bra for a moment , and then i feel his def ##t fingers un ##ho ##ok the front closure of my new bra . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my breasts spring out , and his thumbs brush against my nipples as he cups them in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he begins to massage them more strongly , and suddenly i feel him sucking my right nipple into my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] he flick ##s his tongue across it as he sucks , then moves to my other side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m ready , ' ' i moan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - uh , not yet , ' ' he replies , pulling my breast out of his mouth for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] then he begins to trail kisses down my stomach , pausing for a moment to circle his tongue in my belly button . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him graz ##e his fingers across the narrow strips of fabric on the sides of my panties . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like these very much , ' ' he murmurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe we ' ll try to keep these on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] then he ' s gone . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the sounds of what could be his shirt being pulled over his head , but i ca n ' t be sure . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s silence for another minute , and i ' m suspended in this pool of pleasure where he ' s left me , completely under his control . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as i feel him blow a stream of warm breath against my panties and feel my body shake in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands run up my thighs and then under the sides of my underwear , and i know he must be kneeling in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him slowly dip one finger under the right side of my panties , pulling them away from my body and tucking them to the other side . [SEP]
[CLS] he blows on me again , and now his breath hits my clit directly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` spread your legs , ' ' he commands me quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , inch ##ing myself out on my high heels . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue slides into my slit and i cry out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , nate , ' ' i moan , and he begins to flick his tongue back and forth across me . [SEP]
[CLS] i un ##rave ##l quickly , and he begins to speed up , circling his tongue rapidly . [SEP]
[CLS] but just as i ' m on the brink , my body arching as much as it can , he slow ##s down again . [SEP]
[CLS] i whimper . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t stop completely , but he ' s not going fast enough to bring me release . [SEP]
[CLS] his right hand slips over my ass , under the fabric of my panties . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as he slips one finger inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never had anything back there . [SEP]
[CLS] he circles it inside me , mirror ##ing his actions with his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] once i get over my surprise at the foreign feeling , i find that i like it . [SEP]
[CLS] on top of everything that he ' s already done to me , and is still doing , it ' s driving me right toward the edge again . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan as he slips two fingers from his other hand inside my opening , making a beck ##oning motion against my g - spot . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a spa ##sm begin to rip through my body , but he pulls his mouth away completely . [SEP]
[CLS] my knees almost buckle at the empty feeling he ' s left behind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . ' ' i protest . [SEP]
[CLS] he leans back in , flicking his tongue once , hard , over my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] my body ripple ##s in response . [SEP]
[CLS] the pleasure has built up inside me to such an extent that being unable to let go of it feels painful . [SEP]
[CLS] i need him to let me come . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he answers innocent ##ly , and torture ##s me with another hard flick of his tongue , his fingers still circling slowly inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please . . . ' ' the pleasure is over ##loading my brain , and i can barely think . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need you . . . please . [SEP]
[CLS] i need you inside me right now . [SEP]
[CLS] please , i ' m begging you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m begging you , nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i almost faint with relief as he takes his fingers out of me and i hear the sound of a condom being ripped open . [SEP]
[CLS] he steps into me and grabs one of my legs , wrapping it around his waist as he thrusts into me . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out at the contact . [SEP]
[CLS] he drives in hard , slamming me against the bed post , and on just his second thrust , i feel my orgasm finally releasing through me as he presses into me again and again . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth covers mine as the last waves of pleasure crest over me . [SEP]
[CLS] even though i ' m exhausted , i can feel that he ' s still hard inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him reach behind me , and realize that he ' s un ##k ##not ##ting the t - shirt around my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] my arms drop to my sides , and he pulls out of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him taking my hips and turning me , then he presses one hand roughly down on my back and i realize he ' s pressing my top half down onto the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn my head to the side so i can breathe as he pulls my panties , still bunch ##ed to one side , to my ankles . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand still holding me down , i feel him enter me from behind . [SEP]
[CLS] even though i ' m spent from my first orgasm and all the build - up leading to it , i feel my body begin to respond again . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him slide his thumb into my ass and gasp . [SEP]
[CLS] i never realized how many nerves endings were back there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` brace yourself , ' ' he warns me , and begins to thrust harder into me . [SEP]
[CLS] my fingers search for the edge of the bed and i ' m just able to grasp it as he drives in deeper than he ever has before . [SEP]
[CLS] he plunge ##s into me again and again , hitting my g - spot directly every time . [SEP]
[CLS] a second orgasm takes me by surprise , as though it was lying dormant until he awoke it . [SEP]
[CLS] my body arches and shakes as i feel him pull out of me and a wet ##ness cover my back . [SEP]
[CLS] as my body quiet ##s , i hear him hurrying to the bathroom and then him rubbing a tissue on my back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i do n ' t know why i did that , ' ' he murmurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hm ? [SEP]
[CLS] did what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i mum ##ble , reaching up to remove the makeshift blind ##fold from my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i came on you , ' ' he replies , halt ##ing his wiping motions to look me in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . it ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] it does n ' t bother me , ' ' i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , looking relieved . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never done that before , i just . . . i just wanted to see it on you , or something . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m worried . . . i worry i push you too far . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like what we do together , ' ' i reply , stretching my arms above my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as far as i ' m concerned , we ' re going to do a lot more , so you better get used to it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . [SEP]
[CLS] now clean me off . [SEP]
[CLS] if we ' re going to do this again tomorrow night , i need to get some sleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - four the next day , thorn ##hill and co . is abu ##zz with the official announcement of mark broad ##man becoming a new client . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s talk that other high - profile investors could follow suit , including some of broad ##man ' s contacts in silicon valley . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently the tech crowd is quite interested in influencing public policy . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just glad that everyone is in such a good mood , because it helps me fit in . [SEP]
[CLS] my relationship with nate , not to mention our late night sessions , has me practically glowing . [SEP]
[CLS] constance talks to me happily in our cubic ##le , the awkward ##ness of our first day of working together having finally melted away over the summer months . [SEP]
[CLS] she sw ##ive ##ls in her chair and raises her eyebrows at me as greg walks by , giving me a small wave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , what happened there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks con ##sp ##ira ##tori ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was nothing , ' ' i assure her , keeping my eyes on my computer , though i can see out of my periphery that she ' s still looking at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , come on . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t tell . [SEP]
[CLS] but it ' s obvious . . . i mean , for a couple weeks you guys were hanging out a bunch , and now he completely avoids you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we went on a couple dates , and then we decided to break it off . [SEP]
[CLS] but please keep it between us , alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm ##hm , ' ' constance murmurs , sw ##ive ##ling back around . [SEP]
[CLS] she can sense , rightful ##ly so , that i ' m not telling her the whole story . [SEP]
[CLS] greg reacted as well as could be hoped when i told him i did n ' t want to go on any more dates with him . [SEP]
[CLS] i blamed the office environment , and said i had extra pressure on me to be professional as the boss ' s step ##da ##ught ##er , but i think he saw through that excuse . [SEP]
[CLS] at least he could never guess the real reason . [SEP]
[CLS] now whenever i see him he ' s polite but stand ##off ##ish . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch the corner of my screen , waiting to see if allison will send me a g ##cha ##t message , but none arrives . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll give it a little more time , and then reach out to her . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to throw our whole friendship away over my relationship with nate - not that we do n ' t have some things to talk about . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not that i need her approval exactly , but i do need her to stop judging . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lunch , ' ' constance says , nu ##d ##ging me . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand up and see other people making their way to the big conference room . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce has had lunch cater ##ed for the whole office to celebrate the new client . [SEP]
[CLS] as we walk in , i notice that the temporary wall to the kitchen has been pulled back to make way for everyone . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce and roderick , his business partner , stand by the buffet , happily talking with their employees . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce smiles at me as constance and i make our way up to grab some plates . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` roderick , you ' ve met my step ##da ##ught ##er bryn ##n , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , good to see you again , bryn ##n , ' ' roderick , a well - dressed man a bit younger than pierce says , then turns away to shake someone ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce leans in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look particularly beautiful today , bryn ##n , ' ' he remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , thank you , pierce , ' ' i reply , a bit taken aback . [SEP]
[CLS] constance and i stand around the conference room for a while talking to the other intern ##s , everyone sharing their plans for once they get back to school , and the rising seniors , like me , discussing what we ' ll do after we graduate . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually the crowd begins to thin out , and constance and i each take a cup ##cake back to our cubic ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? [SEP]
[CLS] vanilla ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i peer at the frost ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so , though i heard there were some coconut - ' ' i break off as my desk phone rings . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at it in surprise for a second - no one ever calls me on it - then reach forward to pick it up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n speaking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , it ' s pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] could you come into my office for a moment ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sure , i ' ll be right there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hang up and stand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce , ' ' i explain to constance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably wants to see if i ' ll be home for dinner tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nods , and i walk down the hallway to his corner office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he asked me to - ' ' i explain to his secretary , gwen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , go on in , ' ' she replies , waving me in . [SEP]
[CLS] i knock softly as i open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he beck ##ons me inside and indicates i should take a seat across from his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , thanks for coming in , ' ' he says , standing and walking around his desk as he takes his reading glasses off and places them on his desktop calendar . [SEP]
[CLS] i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that i ' m just your stepfather , but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any . . . difficulties . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , thanks , ' ' i stumble , surprised by the direction of the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] he stands and begins to pace behind my chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a very beautiful young woman , and i hope that you can see me as a sort of protector . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him come up and stand behind the chair . [SEP]
[CLS] i start as he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers graz ##e against my skin just above the fabric of my dress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could n ' t help but notice this , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this bruise , ' ' he explains , still holding my hair to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mind races . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i bet i got it last night when nate had me up against that bed post , and of course it ' s not in the sort of position where i ' d see it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , it ' s nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s probably old , maybe from when i fell on that hike . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i doubt it . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , how far does it extend . . . ' ' i ' m horrified to feel him un ##zi ##p the top of my dress , all the way down to my bra strap . [SEP]
[CLS] he spreads his fingers across my back and a sick ##ening feeling spreads through my body with them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , you have such a beautiful body . [SEP]
[CLS] you should n ' t be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his fingertips just touch the top of my bra strap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , and jump up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really do n ' t think this is appropriate , ' ' i ad ##mon ##ish him with as much confidence as i can muster , while reaching behind myself to pull my zipper up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i ' m just trying to look out for you . [SEP]
[CLS] you clearly need a father figure in your life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just fine , thank you very much , ' ' i reply shortly , glaring at him as i manage to zip my dress . [SEP]
[CLS] i march to the door , taking a deep breath to compose myself as i walk through the door . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom , quickly locking myself inside a stall . [SEP]
[CLS] i lower the toilet seat and sit down , pressing my hands onto my burning cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] i know pierce ' s words were saying one thing , but his actions , his touch , were saying quite another . [SEP]
[CLS] it just felt wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time i sit back down at my desk , i ' m already second - guessing myself . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i mis ##rea ##d his behavior ; maybe he was just trying to look out for me , but he ' s never had a daughter , so he did n ' t realize he was making me uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] constance asks over her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine , ' ' i reply , pushing my une ##ate ##n cup ##cake away . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not hungry anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to make it through the rest of the work day , though i know that i ' ll just have to see pierce at home for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] as i drive home , i wonder if i should say i ' m sick or something so i ' ll be able to just be by myself in my room . [SEP]
[CLS] but as i walk in through the garage , my mom calls me into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] i carefully spread my hair over my neck to hide the bruises , then walk in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n , honey , i ' m so glad you ' re home . [SEP]
[CLS] come look , ' ' she gus ##hes , pulling me into the dining room . [SEP]
[CLS] i see that she ' s set it with fine china and crystal , and a massive vase of white lil ##ies sits in the center . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i ' d do something a little special tonight to celebrate . [SEP]
[CLS] what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looks great , mom , ' ' i reply half - hearted ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] if she notices my down ##tro ##dden mood , she does n ' t mention it , she just sweeps me back into the kitchen to show me the extravagant meal she ' s spent the day preparing . [SEP]
[CLS] when pierce comes home about half an hour later , he quickly enters his study , calling to us that he has to make a quick call . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks me to carry the roasted duck out on a silver tray , and i ac ##qui ##es ##ce , knowing i ' d feel too guilty to fake sick when she ' s spent so much time on the food . [SEP]
[CLS] when i walk back into the kitchen , pierce is murmur ##ing into my mom ' s ear as she blush ##es , so i quickly back out again . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear nate enter through the front door , and he walks into the dining room just as i ' m leaning on the back of my chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' he says with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was thinking about you - ' ' he breaks off as my mom and pierce walk in . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce brand ##ish ##es a bottle of champagne and walks around filling up our crystal flutes . [SEP]
[CLS] i step back to give him a wide berth , and then we all sit down as he finishes filling up his own glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cheers , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] i avoid his eye contact as we all cl ##ink our glasses . [SEP]
[CLS] nate frowns at me slightly and i know he can tell there ' s something up . [SEP]
[CLS] oh god , i ca n ' t even think about talking to him later tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] he can always tell when i ' m lying , so i do n ' t know what i ' m going to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , did you messenger those envelope ##s like i asked ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce says , turning to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hm ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , startled by his question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the envelope ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to double check because you ' ve seemed so distracted lately , and they ' re quite important . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i frown at him . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t ask me to messenger anything today , pierce . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , ' ' he sighs in a patron ##izing way , setting down his champagne glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , a little more defensive ##ly than i mean to . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at nate and see him raising his eyebrows at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know that i did . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s not like this is the first time this has happened , ' ' pierce counters . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe we should - ' ' my mom breaks in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , no , ' ' i say to her , holding up my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i honestly do n ' t know what you ' re talking about pierce . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , this clearly is n ' t the time to discuss it , but since you ' re pressing me , i ' ve heard from some of your immediate superiors that you have n ' t been very responsible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] like who ? [SEP]
[CLS] when ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` obviously i ca n ' t give you exact dates , and i need to protect their an ##ony ##mity - ' ' ` ` wow . [SEP]
[CLS] wow , ' ' i snap , tossing down my napkin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are just making all this up , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , calm down , ' ' nate murmurs from across the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` calm down ? [SEP]
[CLS] seriously ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s lying ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he has no reason to - ' ' nate argues . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he damn well does . [SEP]
[CLS] he called me into his office today and un ##zi ##pped my dress , and i told him to back off , and now he ' s pissed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know that ' s because i was worried about those bruises on your neck , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t get hysterical . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a liar , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] he slams his hand down on the table , causing me to jump . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will not be spoken to that way in my own house ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance back and forth at my mom and nate , speechless . [SEP]
[CLS] are they really just going to sit there staring at me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i stand up so abruptly that my chair almost falls over backward . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t take being surrounded by this bullshit anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk quickly around the table and then out the front door , clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i ' m outside . [SEP]
[CLS] as i close the door behind me , i pick up my pace , walking straight down the driveway and out of the gates . [SEP]
[CLS] the woods rise up quiet and dark around me as tears of frustration and humiliation begin to stream down my face . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know where i ' m going - i just need to get away from that house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! [SEP]
[CLS] wait ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear a woman ' s voice call out behind me , but i keep walking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re bryn ##n , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i freeze and take a deep breath before turning around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , if you ' re a reporter or something , i ' m really not in the mood . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i can just see her blonde hair reflect the moonlight as she takes a couple steps closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a reporter . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m nate ' s mom , eileen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - five ` ` are . . . are you alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , taking another step toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m , i ' m just - ' ' i break off as a sob escapes my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s alright . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve got some tissues in my car - why do n ' t you come sit down for a moment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] in a sane ##r moment , i might have questioned the safety of getting into a strange woman ' s car , but this is not a sane moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she wraps her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her blue sedan , parked just down the street from the gates of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] she sits me down then hu ##rries around to the driver ' s side and gets in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here you go , ' ' she says , pulling a box of tissues from the floor of the back seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' i murmur rather inc ##oh ##ere ##ntly . [SEP]
[CLS] she flip ##s on the car ' s overhead light . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the woman from the boat ##house parking lot . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiles wryly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you saw me that day . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not a stalker or anything . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just , sometimes i like to get a glimpse of him , that ' s all . [SEP]
[CLS] see what he looks like , how he ' s doing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what ' s happened to you ? [SEP]
[CLS] is there anything i can do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s pierce , ' ' i murmur as more tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' d he do now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he . . . he made a pass at me at work . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i actually was n ' t sure that ' s what it was right after , but then tonight he got on my case about something i did n ' t even do , and that ' s when i knew for sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sweetie , i ' m sorry , ' ' she says , rubbing my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce has a serious case of en ##ti ##tlement . [SEP]
[CLS] he thinks that anything with a va ##gina is fair game , even his step ##da ##ught ##er , it seems . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treats nate , but i just had n ' t felt it directed at me yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stills . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he does n ' t treat nate well ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , oh , i ' m sorry , ' ' i reply , looking at her through b ##lea ##ry eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s . . . he ' s very hard on nate . [SEP]
[CLS] he calls him entitled , selfish , when i think those are really things he knows deep down are true about himself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my little nate , ' ' she murmurs to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but he ' s really . . . nate is a good person , you should know that . [SEP]
[CLS] well , to be honest , at first i thought he was more like pierce , but that ' s just a cover . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it ' s that half his genes are yours , or maybe his father raised him to be a better person than he is himself , i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] but he ' s smart , funny , hard ##working . . . ' ' ` ` thank you , ' ' she says , taking my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry you have to go through this . [SEP]
[CLS] did you tell your mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she found out at dinner , but . . . ' ' i shake my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s completely under pierce ' s spell . [SEP]
[CLS] she gets like that about men , but i ' ve never seen her quite so en ##amo ##red of one before him . [SEP]
[CLS] she looks a lot like you , actually , ' ' i realize , studying her beautiful , slightly lined face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce certainly has a type , ' ' she says with a sad smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s another thing you should know . . . about nate . . . i found out after you called : he thinks you left because he was too much for you , because he was a bad kid , basically . [SEP]
[CLS] i tried to talk to him about it , really , but he would n ' t hear it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate was a wonderful child , and even if he ' d been the devil inca ##rna ##te , i still would n ' t have left him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i figured as much . [SEP]
[CLS] he said that the night before you left , you and pierce had a big fight over him , because he mis ##be ##ha ##ved , and that ' s why you left the next day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , god , ' ' she murmurs , covering her face in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he must have felt so alone , so responsible . [SEP]
[CLS] no . . . i remember that fight , because it was our last . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d been to some big gala that night , and we ' d seen this woman there who was in our circle at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew he ' d cheated before , but he promised me he ' d stopped , and then at this party , i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together . [SEP]
[CLS] i confronted him about it at home , and he barely even bothered to deny it . [SEP]
[CLS] i was yelling at him , asking what kind of example he was setting for his son . [SEP]
[CLS] i left . . . i never thought that would be one of the last times i ' d see nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i never thought that was even a possibility . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to help you , ' ' i say suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] no . [SEP]
[CLS] you have too much going on already , ' ' eileen says , shaking her head em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i want to . [SEP]
[CLS] not just for you , either . [SEP]
[CLS] for nate . [SEP]
[CLS] he needs you in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] i can tell that you ' re good , and kind , and he needs people like that to love him . [SEP]
[CLS] please let me help you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to put you in a position . . . i do n ' t want to je ##opa ##rdi ##ze anything . [SEP]
[CLS] you and nate , you have a special relationship . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , sure , yeah , he ' s a great guy , ' ' i hedge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n . . . it ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` know what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i saw you that day at the boat ##house , i could just tell . [SEP]
[CLS] at first i thought you were his girlfriend , and then i realized who you were , and i saw the way you two looked at each other . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re in love , ' ' she whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to tug at my hair nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve acted on your feelings ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s all i can do to nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do your parents know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , you do n ' t have to be embarrassed . [SEP]
[CLS] life ' s messy . [SEP]
[CLS] people find love wherever they can . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , it ' s not like you ' re breaking any laws . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my tears begin to slip down my face again , renewed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe it ' s so obvious . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i just caught you two in an un ##guard ##ed moment . [SEP]
[CLS] but , see , if nate and you are together , i do n ' t want to come between you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly , i ' d like him to meet you . [SEP]
[CLS] i think it might do him some good . [SEP]
[CLS] when pierce was chewing me out tonight , he did n ' t say anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ll meet with him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re sure it ' s ok with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure how i ' ll set it up yet , but write down your number for me , and i ' ll get in touch with you when i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nods and tears a slip of paper from a paperback book in the back seat . [SEP]
[CLS] as she hands it to me and i get out of the car , she leans over into the passenger seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , if i could just give you a little advice . . . i would avoid pierce for the next few days . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t like it when people stand up to him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod and shut the door , walking slowly back to the house as i run my fingers over her phone number . [SEP]
[CLS] i peer cautiously through the first floor windows , not wanting to walk back in on dinner , but it looks like they ' ve finished and the plates have all been cleared . [SEP]
[CLS] i quietly open the front door and tip ##to ##e up the stairs to my bedroom , locking my door behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i put eileen ' s phone number on my bureau and am just about to change out of my dress when i hear a soft knock on the door . [SEP]
[CLS] usually nate just comes in now , so he clearly knows that i ' m upset with him . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk over and unlock it , then open it a few inches . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you locked it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , looking hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to be alone right now , ' ' i murmur , though a knot forms in my throat at the thought of spending the first night in a week without him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i ca n ' t choose between you , ' ' he whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks so for ##lor ##n , and i see a glimpse of the little boy that he once was , over ##hear ##ing his parents ' arguments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re going to some charity lunch tomorrow afternoon . . . maybe we could spend some time together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i nod , my mind already moving in a different direction . [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses , unsure if he should kiss me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` alright , goodnight , ' ' he says , and walks down the hallway to his bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] i close and lock the door after him , then grab my cell phone and put in eileen ' s number . [SEP]
[CLS] tomorrow afternoon , i text her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll let you know when my parents are gone , and then you come meet nate . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - six i ya ##wn as i sit by my window , waiting for the sounds of my mom and pierce leaving . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t able to sleep well at all last night . [SEP]
[CLS] there were too many worries rattling around in my brain . [SEP]
[CLS] mainly , though , it felt strange not to see nate . [SEP]
[CLS] i missed his presence in my bed with a physical ache that g ##na ##wed away at me . [SEP]
[CLS] finally i hear some movement in the rest of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk to my door and crack it open , sticking my head out into the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just hear my mom murmur ##ing something to pierce as they make their way to the garage . [SEP]
[CLS] soon i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll give them ten minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] i wait impatiently , and as soon as it ' s up , i text eileen and head down to the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily nate has been safely en ##sco ##nce ##d in his room all morning . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if he even got up to train this morning , which is highly unusual for him . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' i murmur quietly as she reaches the steps and i open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' she replies nervously , smoothing her blouse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do i look alright ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look fine , ' ' i assure her . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t imagine how she must feel , finally seeing her son face - to - face after all these years . [SEP]
[CLS] she looks around the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , this place is even bigger than it looks from outside . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s ridiculous , ' ' i agree , and usher her into the den . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce and my mom are at some charity lunch , so they ' ll be gone for a while , ' ' i tell her . [SEP]
[CLS] she bites her lip nervously and takes a seat on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll call nate down , alright ? [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t told him anything . . . i was n ' t sure he would come otherwise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nods , and i head to the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i yell , and hear his bedroom door open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wan na come down to the den ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a fis ##sure of guilt as he replies happily , ` ` sure ! [SEP]
[CLS] be right there , ' ' and i hear him moving around . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t like the idea of setting a trap and lying to him , but i rational ##ize that it ' s in the service of a greater truth , that of the true nature of his parents ' relationship , and his father ' s character . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk back into the den , and stand nervously next to the couch where eileen ' s sitting . [SEP]
[CLS] she stands as we hear nate walking down the stairs , and then he turns the corner and sees us . [SEP]
[CLS] his face is a blank as he surveys the scene before him . [SEP]
[CLS] he takes a step forward , looks like he ' s going to say something , and then steps back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , it ' s me , your mom , ' ' eileen whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know who you are , ' ' nate replies quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you should hear what she has to say . [SEP]
[CLS] please , will you just sit for a minute ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s face twists into a s ##neer - an expression i have n ' t seen in weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re unbelievable , ' ' he spit ##s at me , and storms out the front door , slamming it behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] eileen sits down with a muted cry , and i run after him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call as i shut the door behind me and head down the front steps . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s walking around the side of the house , probably headed for the garage and his car to make an escape . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you just listen to me for a second ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? [SEP]
[CLS] so you can try to poison my mind against my dad some more ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he yells , reeling around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m trying to tell you the truth about him ! [SEP]
[CLS] eileen can tell you - ' ' ` ` oh , so this is all about you ! [SEP]
[CLS] you can try to paint it as some benevolent way of getting a mother and son to reunite , but really , this is all about getting me to believe your story , ' ' he turns again and begins to walk away across the grass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s not true ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i protest , pursuing him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your mom is a good person - i wanted to help her , and you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pathetic , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , spinning around again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop following me . [SEP]
[CLS] whatever mistakes we made together this summer , it ' s over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] nate , i - ' ' i feel like he just punched me in the gut . [SEP]
[CLS] how did this all go so wrong ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i ' ve fucked , but you ' re not , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] from now on , let ' s just smile at each other politely from across the room at family events , like normal steps ##ib ##lings do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no ! [SEP]
[CLS] we are different , we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re just attached because i was your first . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t worry about it , you ' ll get over it soon . [SEP]
[CLS] you were nothing special to me , bryn ##n , ' ' he says and walks through the garage ' s side door . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand in shock as i watch the garage door slide open and his wr ##ang ##ler come speeding out . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch him head down the driveway , then disappear around the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the front door open behind me , and eileen approach me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , bryn ##n , this is all my fault . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s not , ' ' i reply , biting my lip to keep from sobbing . [SEP]
[CLS] she puts her arm around me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s just angry . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' ll come to his senses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he ' s just as stubborn as i am . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s really over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i collapse against her , burying my head on her shoulder as i begin to cry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first love always hits the hardest , ' ' she murmurs as she rubs my arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on - your parents wo n ' t be back for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll make you some tea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after eileen leaves and i ' ve hidden away in my room , i ca n ' t help but marvel at her kindness . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been a long time since my own mother has taken care of me and comfort ##ed me the way she did , even though the afternoon might have gone even worse for her than it did for me . [SEP]
[CLS] she told me that she ' s learned not to get her hopes up for a reunion over the years , though it does still hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep pic ##turing the anger on nate ' s face as he ended our romantic relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] i could tell he really meant the things he was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] my body ache ##s at the thought that i wo n ' t get to touch him again , and feel him against me . [SEP]
[CLS] already i feel like it ' s been ages since i ' ve seen him . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear my mom and pierce come home in the late afternoon , and i glance at my locked door . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to see them now , or anytime soon , for that matter . [SEP]
[CLS] i think of how nate begins to resemble his father when he gets angry , but his mother in his kindness . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she was only in his life until he was eight or nine , she must have had some influence on him in those early years , in addition to whatever good traits she passed down to him genetically . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose i wanted to tip the scales in her direction , to make sure that nate keeps listening to the side of himself that his mother has passed on to him . [SEP]
[CLS] but clearly , i do n ' t have the power to make such a thing happen . [SEP]
[CLS] mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] he referred to what happened between us as a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] my body curls around myself as though i ' ve just been punched in the gut . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the pain rev ##er ##ber ##ating in my bones . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i ' ve fucked , but you ' re not . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re nothing special to me , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] his words keep echoing around in my head , and i ca n ' t make them go away . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i ' ve ever felt so completely hollow before . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , i fall asleep , my body finally giving in to the exhaustion i feel . [SEP]
[CLS] when i wake up , it ' s almost ten at night . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom did n ' t even try to wake me for dinner , i realize . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a surge of anger against her . [SEP]
[CLS] mothers are supposed to protect their children , but of course she ' s taking pierce ' s side . [SEP]
[CLS] she thinks he ' s some kind of savior , rescuing her and her abandoned daughter from some lonely life . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to scream . [SEP]
[CLS] i want her to be stronger , to be there for me like i ' ve been there for her countless times . [SEP]
[CLS] but i know my anger is useless ; i ' ve long ago realized that i ca n ' t change her , ca n ' t expect her to be any different from the way that she is . [SEP]
[CLS] my stomach gr ##umble ##s , reminding me that i ' ve skipped a meal or two today . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t even feel like eating , but i know that i ' ll never be able to get to sleep again tonight without a little something in my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh and get out of bed and head over to my bureau , pulling a sweatshirt on over my t - shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] i cautiously open my door and listen . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i can just hear the sounds of the tv from my mom and pierce ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] should be safe , then . [SEP]
[CLS] i tip ##to ##e down the hallway , pausing at the open door to nate ' s dark room . [SEP]
[CLS] still out , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] probably drinking somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] how long can this situation last ? [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder as i walk quietly down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like we ' re all tightly - wound strings , and one of us is bound to break sometime . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i for one ca n ' t keep creeping around the house like this , avoiding everyone . [SEP]
[CLS] in the kitchen , i fix myself a grille ##d cheese sandwich , feeling the need for some comfort food . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just turning off the stove top when i hear the door to pierce ' s study open . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry to grab the spat ##ula and slide the sandwich onto my plate before he comes in , but i ' m too late . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , ' ' he says from the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we missed you at dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] u ##gh , that asshole , acting like nothing happened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just fixing something now , ' ' i answer shortly . [SEP]
[CLS] as i put the spat ##ula and pan into the sink , i see over my shoulder that he ' s walking toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] he plants himself between the island and the fridge , trapping me by the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your mother is very upset , ' ' he tells me , his eyebrow bending into a concerned frown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is she ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask through gritted teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] if he expects me to apologize , as though her mood is my fault , then he ' s mistaken . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i think you ' ve gotten the wrong idea about me , ' ' he murmurs , taking another step toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] i reluctantly turn to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have no idea how hard it is for a man , to have a beautiful woman like you in the house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m your step ##da ##ught ##er , pierce , ' ' i practically growl as my heartbeat jumps in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve really blossom ##ed this summer , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve become a woman , ' ' he says , stepping into me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his warm breath on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to get away from me , ' ' i whisper , my throat tightening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just for a moment . . . i need to feel . . . ' ' he moans pit ##iful ##ly , sliding his hand onto my hip and then over my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] my anger ign ##ites at his touch , blasting away my fear . [SEP]
[CLS] i get my arms up between us and shove him away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get off me , you fucking asshole ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i scream . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks at me in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think you ' re some gentleman with your fancy suits and your mansion , but inside you ' re just some sick per ##vert , taking advantage of anyone you can . [SEP]
[CLS] i see who you really are , even if no one else does . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his face twists with anger , and i feel my cheek light up with pain before my brain can process that he ' s slapped me . [SEP]
[CLS] i bring my hand up to my burning face , my head still pulled to the side , just as pierce disappears in a blur . [SEP]
[CLS] i straighten up with a gasp as i realize nate has just tackled him to the floor , and they are now gr ##app ##ling fiercely on the kitchen tiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you fucking touch her ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he yells at his father , whose face is turning red in an effort to defend himself against his much stronger son . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear footsteps from the stairwell and see my mom running down the hallway and manage to un ##free ##ze myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate ! [SEP]
[CLS] nate , stop ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i yell , as he manages to find the top position . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom screams as nate punches pierce hard across his jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] i throw myself on nate ' s back as he cock ##s his arm back in preparation for another punch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate , i ' m ok , i ' m ok , ' ' i repeat in his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him relax a little and begin to pull him up . [SEP]
[CLS] he drops his arm and stands up with me . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce pushes him away as he stands up , too , and they face off , each breathing heavily , pierce with a trail of blood dripping from the corner of his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom finally whispers , her voice full of fear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i saw everything , ' ' nate growls , addressing his father . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you h ##yp ##oc ##rite . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] to my shock , pierce begins to laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i knew it , i knew it ! [SEP]
[CLS] look at you two ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , pointing at us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s he talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks , glancing at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re fucking ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce bursts out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . . . what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom murmurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , christ , holly , are you really that fucking stupid ? [SEP]
[CLS] you did n ' t even suspect ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom shakes her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s why you ' re fighting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' nate says , turning to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i saw him trying to feel up bryn ##n , and then she told him to stop , and he slapped her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a look of horror spreads across my mom ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] she looks at me , then at pierce . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this true ? [SEP]
[CLS] is it true ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce does n ' t even bother responding to her accusations , just turns his palms upward and shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] a wai ##ling cry escapes my mom ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] for a second i think she ' s going to collapse , but then she throws herself at pierce , her limbs a blur as she attacks him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i trusted you ! [SEP]
[CLS] i trusted you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she screams . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce puts his arms up to defend himself as nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her , hem ##ming her in and then pulling her away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my own daughter ! [SEP]
[CLS] my own daughter , you son of a bitch ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a strangled cry , she turns her head and begins to sob against nate ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce surveys the three of us , aligned against him on the other side of the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate whispers , as he rubs my mom ' s shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have nothing to say for yourself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , nate . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re really going to believe them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce says , a s ##neer of contempt on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t have to - i saw you with my own eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] but i should have believed bryn ##n in the first place , ' ' nate says quietly , though i can hear the strength in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce can only manage a snort of der ##ision before he walks toward the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mother , ' ' nate says , and pierce stops , his back still toward his son . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you made everything up , did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pierce stands frozen for a moment , his head slightly cocked to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t see his face , and ca n ' t imagine what could be going on inside his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] his carefully crafted history , now falling apart around him . [SEP]
[CLS] he shakes his head slightly , as if waving away an unpleasant smell , then continues to walk down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] he heads straight to the front door , and shut ##s it behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] as we hear the sound of his car heading down the driveway , my mom straighten ##s up , and nate ' s arms fall to his sides . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to be alone for a little while , ' ' she murmurs , her gaze on the floor , and walks un ##stead ##ily toward the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch her leave , wishing she had the strength to comfort me for even a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s just in shock , ' ' nate says , reading my mind like always . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' i reply with a nod , struggling to keep myself together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should have believed you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had no reason to lie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i just could n ' t believe he was capable of that kind of thing , or maybe i did n ' t want to believe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you said some awful things to me today . [SEP]
[CLS] god , was that just today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask with a sad laugh , reaching up to rub my forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] i was angry . . . sometimes my temper . . . i did n ' t mean any of those things . [SEP]
[CLS] the time we ' ve spent together - ' ' he says , taking a step toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not ready for that . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if we can go back . . . ' ' i murmur , a tear slipping down my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , please , i ca n ' t lose you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were so ready to turn on me , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ready to push me away and be done with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was in shock at seeing her again . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t actually mean it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you said it , did n ' t you ? [SEP]
[CLS] the way i care about you . . . i would never treat you that way , would never want you to hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] but you wanted me to hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t feel the way about me that i feel about you . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not true ! [SEP]
[CLS] you have no idea how much i care about - ' ' ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a long silence . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare up into his beautiful face , my heart shattering as he does n ' t reply . [SEP]
[CLS] he just looks back down at me , some un ##k ##now ##able emotion flickering across his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , there you go . [SEP]
[CLS] there you go . [SEP]
[CLS] goodbye , nate , ' ' i say , turning my back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t move . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he finally asks quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , well , ' ' i begin with a cold laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' m going to eat this cold grille ##d cheese sandwich , and then i ' m going to start packing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - seven i survey my mom ' s old beat - up station wagon . [SEP]
[CLS] both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being sold , but my mom was able to back out . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily she was taking her time in the process because she did n ' t think she had to worry about money anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] the car is n ' t even full - the only things that belonged to us here were our clothes and some kn ##ick - kn ##ack ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it only took me a few hours this morning to pack it up . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s both sad and comforting . [SEP]
[CLS] our old life is still waiting for us , almost as though this whole summer never happened . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course it did . [SEP]
[CLS] i wondered last night if i would take these last few months back if i could . [SEP]
[CLS] if i were given a magic wand that could make it so that my mom had never met pierce , that i ' d returned to our old house for the summer , that my relationship with nate had never gone beyond that encounter in the crew house , would i wave it ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if i ' ve ever felt so much pain as i have recently , but also never so much happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] i was held in such a tight little shell before , never really experiencing the depths or heights of anything , and i suppose you ca n ' t have one without the other . [SEP]
[CLS] to never have held nate in my arms . . . no , i ca n ' t imagine it . [SEP]
[CLS] despite so many terrible things having happened , i would never want to erase the time i spent with him , even if it would take away the pain i ' m feeling right now . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain that i can feel even in my bones , causing a throbbing ache throughout my whole body . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like i ' m det ##ox ##ing from some powerful , addict ##ive substance . [SEP]
[CLS] one that i know only hurts me in the end . [SEP]
[CLS] i catch a glimpse of my slightly swollen lip in the car window from where pierce hit me last night . [SEP]
[CLS] we have n ' t seen him today - he must be hole ##d up at a friend ' s house or a hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t even want to think of the divorce proceedings that my mom will be wrapped up in now . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the front door shut behind me and turn - will it be nate coming to say goodbye ? [SEP]
[CLS] but it ' s my mom , carrying one last small suitcase , her eyes covered in large , round sunglasses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ready ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , without looking at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , then remember one last thing i ' ve forgotten . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be right back , ' ' i say , and hurry in through the front door without explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk straight up the staircase and down the hall into my bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] it looks exactly the same as the first time i saw it . [SEP]
[CLS] i pause for a moment , taking in the beauty of the furnishings for the last time , before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach my arm all the way to the back and fish out the small slip of paper i st ##ash ##ed there . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk out and down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] nate ' s bedroom door is slightly open and i can tell from the silence that he ' s not inside . [SEP]
[CLS] i push it open all the way and walk to his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i run my hand over his beds ##pre ##ad and breathe in his smell . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull down the comfort ##er and lay the piece of paper on top of his pillow , then pull the comfort ##er back up over it . [SEP]
[CLS] i certainly do n ' t want pierce to find the scrap of paper where eileen wrote her phone number . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m about to leave when something makes me cross over to his window overlooking the river . [SEP]
[CLS] my eye catches on a flash of white on the lower lawn : nate sitting on the top step of the stairs leading down to the rocky shore . [SEP]
[CLS] he sits completely still , his white t - shirt stretched across his broad back . [SEP]
[CLS] i resist the urge to wonder what he ' ll do now - it ' s really none of my business anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry back down to the car and see my mom sitting in the passenger seat . [SEP]
[CLS] i open the driver ' s door and see that she ' s placed the keys on the seat . [SEP]
[CLS] i get in without a word and turn the car on then pull away from the house . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse at it as i turn the corner out of the gate . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom is silent on our drive back to our old house , just staring out the window as we get on the highway that takes us further away from the city , back to our much less expensive neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] a seed of resentment that ' s been building inside of me all summer , or perhaps longer , finally takes root as i glance side ##long at her imp ##ass ##ive face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t even looked at me all day , ' ' i finally say , gripping the steering wheel with white - kn ##uck ##led hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks faintly , still not turning to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t looked at my face , ' ' i repeat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n . . . ' ' she sighs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s true . [SEP]
[CLS] your husband slapped me last night and you never even came to check on me . [SEP]
[CLS] and now you wo n ' t look at the bruise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , i ' ve been very upset . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i have n ' t ? [SEP]
[CLS] he feels me up , hits me , and you have n ' t asked me if i ' m ok . ' ' ` ` it ' s not my fault that he did those things ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shouts , suddenly hysterical . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom , i ' m not blaming you for his actions , alright ? [SEP]
[CLS] but you ' re my mother . [SEP]
[CLS] you should have believed me - you should have taken care of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been taking care of you for years , and this time , i needed you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom sobs once , reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wanted to believe you , bryn ##n , i really did , ' ' she finally gasps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just knew that if i did , everything would fall apart , and it all seemed so perfect . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it was n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it was n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel her hand reach up tentatively to touch my face , and her fingers graz ##e over the small cut in the corner of my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m so sorry , my darling . [SEP]
[CLS] does it hurt much ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hardly at all , ' ' i reply , swallowing the tears that have sprung up at her touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never guessed . . . about you and nate , i mean , ' ' she whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s over , too , ' ' i reply shortly as my emotions threaten to over ##w ##helm me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , ' ' is all she says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i know that might not be the kind of thing you ever want to talk about with your mother , but i ' m here . [SEP]
[CLS] you cared about him a lot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' i answer , my voice ras ##py with held emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i guess you have to get a lawyer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , changing the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , god . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose so , ' ' she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' ll be able to get my old job at the salon back , at least . [SEP]
[CLS] i talked to anita and she said the new girl they got is terrible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you sign a pre - nu ##p ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , thinking of eileen . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i ' ll have to fill my mom in on what i know about her soon , but it would just be too much for me right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she sighs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` iron - clad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - eight i close the door behind me and dump my newly - purchased textbooks on my thin mattress , then straighten up to survey my lawn room . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not much to look at , with its sparse furnishings and lack of bathroom access , though it does have a framed list of every inhabit ##ant that ' s lived here , going back to uv ##a ' s very first class . [SEP]
[CLS] for the last month , i ' ve just been sitting around our old house , doing my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and hiring a lawyer , but there really was n ' t much for me to do . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to drive back down to charlotte ##sville . [SEP]
[CLS] relief because i ' ll have school ##work to occupy my mind , and fear because i might run into nate on campus . [SEP]
[CLS] foolish ##ly , i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i moved out , but he did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] it really was stupid of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i told him that i loved him , and he did n ' t say it back . [SEP]
[CLS] simple as that . [SEP]
[CLS] even though he was angry , there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i was n ' t special to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at the clock . [SEP]
[CLS] just after four - almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be starting . [SEP]
[CLS] i change into my work clothes and head over . [SEP]
[CLS] at least i know i wo n ' t run into nate there - the athletes all have a separate dining hall serving far ta ##sti ##er and more nut ##rit ##ious food . [SEP]
[CLS] i open my door to the lawn , smiling half ##hearted ##ly at another female student a few doors down as she exits her room at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk quickly , keeping my head down , not really wanting to interact with anyone i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i enter the dining hall and cross around to the side door , back into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] roberta , my manager , waves to me from a table by the front , where she ' s doing some paperwork . [SEP]
[CLS] i wave back and head over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s been some issue with your work - study , ' ' she tells me quietly as i reach her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` an issue ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask frowning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know what it is ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something related to your scholarship - that ' s all the dean ' s office told me when they called . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i rub my forehead in frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the last thing i need . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you head over to monroe hall now , you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' she adds , before continuing with her work . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry out of the dining hall and follow roberta ' s advice to see if i can get some more answers , though i fear i already know what happened . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom has been so fra ##zzled lately , i bet she forgot to make a payment on the portion of the tuition that we still owe . [SEP]
[CLS] i explain the situation to a secretary at monroe , who points me toward the office in charge of the work - study program . [SEP]
[CLS] a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the open door of his office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` francis del ##ton , ' ' he introduces himself , shaking my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can i help you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i was told there ' s some issue with my work - study program , or with my scholarship , or something , ' ' i reply , reaching to tug at my hair before realizing it ' s pulled up in a ponytail . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , your name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , sitting down and motion ##ing me into the chair across from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n at ##well , ' ' i respond , spelling it out for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he types my name into his computer and then clicks around for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , this is quite unusual , ' ' he says , raising his eyebrows at his screen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . . . ' ' i reply nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can no longer participate in the work - study program , because your tuition has been paid in full . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , for this semester ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i mean all of your tuition . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head , unable to believe him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for this year ? [SEP]
[CLS] or . . . i mean , not all all ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but that ' s . . . that ' s impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] how ? [SEP]
[CLS] who ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] i can only see that you ' re ineligible for the program . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ok , ' ' i reply , trying to gather my thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you so much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i wander out of his office and out onto the quad . [SEP]
[CLS] with pierce and my mom getting divorced , i knew i ' d have college tuition loans to deal with again , and i took it in stride . [SEP]
[CLS] i was used to the idea , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell ' s going on ? [SEP]
[CLS] i reach into my back pocket and dial my mom . [SEP]
[CLS] i have no idea if she ' ll know either , but i can at least tell her the good news . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , bryn ##n ! [SEP]
[CLS] bryn ##n , i was just going to call you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she says as she picks up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me guess , is it about my tuition ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , hearing excitement in her voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ! [SEP]
[CLS] how did you know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i showed up for my shift at the dining hall , and was told that my tuition ' s been taken care of . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was literally just picking up the phone to tell you . . . it all happened so quickly this afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] pierce ' s lawyer offered me a settlement in the divorce ! [SEP]
[CLS] and it specifically included payment of your tuition . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce paid my tuition ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , my mind reeling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ! [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as i signed , the money was wired over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . . . but mom , was it a good settlement ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , did you have a lawyer look it over ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , it was the same lawyer who told me i ' d get nothing because of the pre - nu ##p i signed . [SEP]
[CLS] he was completely floor ##ed , and told me i ' d better sign before pierce changes his mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . . . why ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , it seems so out of character for him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know ! [SEP]
[CLS] i can hardly believe it either . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s crazy ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a little left over . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , we ' re not rich or anything , but we have a bit of lee ##way now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was it , you know , ' hush money , ' do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i doubt it . [SEP]
[CLS] the lawyer said that there ' s no less reliable witness than a woman trying to def ##ame her ex - husband , so i do n ' t really think pierce would be worried about me going to the press with stories or anything - not that i ' d want to do that anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] but honey , it ' s done now . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s really over . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t have to worry about him anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m glad that you ' re happy with it . [SEP]
[CLS] if you ' re happy i ' m happy . [SEP]
[CLS] man , this is the first good news we ' ve gotten in a while , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i touch my lips with my fingertips , wondering when the last time i smiled was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you seen him yet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my mom asks quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] she does n ' t need to specify that she ' s referring to nate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` though i ' ve convinced myself that every brown - haired guy i ' ve seen from the back is him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s normal , ' ' my mom assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll see him everywhere for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] but it will pass soon , my darling . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twenty - nine realizing i now have the evening off , i take a deep breath and call allison . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m still in a daze , but i want to share my good fortune with her and miriam . [SEP]
[CLS] allison and i have n ' t talked since our argument over the summer , so i ' m relieved when she accepts my invitation on behalf of both of them . [SEP]
[CLS] i pick a rather fancy restaurant , and assure her that it ' s my treat . [SEP]
[CLS] half an hour later , i ' m walking out of my room in a light summer dress - the weather here in virginia is still sw ##elt ##ering , even though it ' s september . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk slowly across the quad to the off - campus restaurant , trying not to work up a sweat . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch a group of freshmen girls giggling as they head out for a group dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] new hall mates , no doubt . [SEP]
[CLS] i remember how nervous i was my first year here , worrying that i would n ' t make any more friends than i did in high school . [SEP]
[CLS] my insides contract as i pass the spot where i first saw nate crossing the grass , just a couple weeks into my freshman year . [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head at myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to forget him . [SEP]
[CLS] when i reach the restaurant , an upscale mexican place known for its flavor ##ed margarita ##s , i ' m relieved to feel the ac hit me . [SEP]
[CLS] the hostess smiles at me just as i see allison sitting in a booth by herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she stands with a nervous smile and i walk over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you do n ' t mind , ' ' she murmurs as we hug awkwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i sort of lied to miriam and told her you pushed back dinner by fifteen minutes so we ' d have a chance to talk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a short bark of laughter escapes my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know if i ' ve ever heard you lie before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] to my surprise , she blush ##es as we sit down across from each other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' ve been thinking about what you said . . . about my being judgment ##al . . . and maybe i am a bit of , you know , a good ##y two - shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i need to loosen up a little . [SEP]
[CLS] what i ' m trying to say is , i ' m sorry for what i said . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reach over and place my hand over hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] it means a lot to hear you say that . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve hated not talking to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me too , ' ' she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] i see her glance over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here i thought i was early ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear miriam say . [SEP]
[CLS] i stand up to give her a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see you two have sync ##ed your watches , being in the same city together all summer ! [SEP]
[CLS] u ##gh , i was so jealous ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sits down with a dramatic sigh in the booth next to allison , her bright red hair falling onto her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . [SEP]
[CLS] catch me up on everything that ' s been happening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] to my horror , i begin to tear up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , god , sorry , ' ' i murmur , reaching for a napkin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison gasps . [SEP]
[CLS] the waiter walks over and is about to ask for our drink orders but they wave him away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s . . . it ' s . . . ' ' i grab a napkin to hide my face and try to take deep breaths . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it a boy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] miriam guess ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , wait . . . not your step ##bro ##ther ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks inc ##red ##ulously . [SEP]
[CLS] allison glances at me and i nod at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she turns to miriam . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they started , you know , seeing each other over the summer . . . but i guess something happened , ' ' she fills miriam in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` long story short , ' ' i say , catching my breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pierce is a jerk , our parents got divorced , and we broke up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow , ' ' miriam breathe ##s , her eyes wide . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you had quite the summer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about it , ' ' i say with a wry smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could really use a drink . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison flags down the waiter , and by the time our first round has arrived , my tears have stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , can i tell you guys my own secret ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] miriam asks , leaning over the table con ##sp ##ira ##tori ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] allison and i nod . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had sex ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , god , now i ' m the only virgin , ' ' allison moans . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how was it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly . . . not that great the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] but the third time , i think i had an orgasm , ' ' miriam whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison asks , cock ##ing her head in confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i think . [SEP]
[CLS] what about you , bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you and nate . . . ' ' she trails off suggest ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um , yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] allison leans forward . [SEP]
[CLS] my heartbeat quick ##ens at the memory of his touch before sadness wash ##es over me . [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d rather not think about it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i finish the rest of the dinner trying to engage in the conversation , but knowing that i ' m often forcing the smile on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] allison and miriam do their best to raise my spirits , and i try to act excited about classes starting on monday , but my mind , and my heart , are n ' t quite in it . [SEP]
[CLS] after i pay the bill , allison and miriam volunteer to walk me back to my room , but i dem ##ur , feeling like a walk by myself before bed . [SEP]
[CLS] after i hug them goodbye , i stroll along the edge of campus , watching all the action un ##fold as everyone enjoys the last weekend free of homework . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not long before i realize my feet are leading me past the crew house . [SEP]
[CLS] just a quick look , i tell myself . [SEP]
[CLS] i begin to walk more slowly as i see it up the street . [SEP]
[CLS] the lights are on inside the house , and i can see some people hanging out on the front porch . [SEP]
[CLS] the late summer night has just darkened , and i stand under a street light peering up at the house . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see several of the crew guys up there , and a petite blonde leaning on the railing with her back toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] the front door swings open and i press my lips together as i see nate walk out with two bottles of beer in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s so close . . . just across the street and up the hill , and yet i ca n ' t be with him , this person with whom i ' ve shared such intimate moments . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart stops as he smiles at the blonde . [SEP]
[CLS] it ca n ' t be . . . he ca n ' t have moved on already . [SEP]
[CLS] but there he is , offering her one of the beers , and sitting down next to her on the railing and wrapping an arm around her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] a chill comes over me despite the warm air . [SEP]
[CLS] i really am a fool . [SEP]
[CLS] i jump as a bottle crashes on a campus path just behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up to see the den ##ize ##ns of the porch also looking at the source of the sound , and freeze for a moment as nate stares right at me . [SEP]
[CLS] fuck . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn around , cursing myself for walking this way . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk quickly down the street , turning right onto a path to take me into campus . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear him call out behind me , and the sound of footsteps coming down the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] i pick up my pace , hoping to lose him in the darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let our first meeting after breaking up be him finding me spying on his house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear a woman ' s voice yell behind me , and almost trip over my own feet in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she calls again , and i turn around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eileen , ' ' i say in surprise as she emerges out of the darkness , slightly out of breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was . . . was that you up there ? [SEP]
[CLS] with nate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nods , a wide smile covering her face . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes dart over his shoulder as i see nate stop by the entrance to the path . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m down here visiting him for the weekend , ' ' she says happily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , oh , ' ' i murmur , covering my face in embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i ran . . . i thought . . . i mean , from the back , i thought you and he were . . . ' ' ` ` oh ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ex ##claim ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i suppose i ' m flat ##tered . . . i mean , i do put my time in at the gym . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she steps forward and takes my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so glad to see you bryn ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] if you had n ' t gotten involved , i would n ' t be here with nate today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i try to blink back tears , but they roll down my cheeks anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry for everything you ' ve been through - nate told me - ' ' ` ` mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate says , stepping forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mind if i talk to bryn ##n alone for a minute ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she calls over her shoulder , then turns to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s so nice to hear him call me ' mom , ' ' ' she says , then leans forward and whispers in my ear , ` ` do n ' t give up hope . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blink at her in surprise as she pulls away and walks back toward nate . [SEP]
[CLS] they share a smile and a few murmured words before she continues back toward the crew house and nate approaches me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , ' ' he murmurs as he walks up to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello , ' ' i reply , a bit more stiffly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i found her number where you left it , ' ' he explains . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we met several times while i was still up in maryland , but it hardly seemed like enough time , so she drove me back down here and is staying for a few days . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he takes a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you told me you loved me - ' ' i raise my hand to stop him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to explain . [SEP]
[CLS] you told me from the beginning that you did n ' t do relationships . . . that you did n ' t lead girls on . [SEP]
[CLS] so i should have known . [SEP]
[CLS] i should n ' t have expected - ' ' ` ` bryn ##n , please . [SEP]
[CLS] just give me two minutes , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , shifting from foot to foot as i wish i could just run away , all the way back to my room and pull the covers over my head . [SEP]
[CLS] anything so that i do n ' t have to hear all the reasons why he does n ' t love me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you told me you loved me , ' ' he resume ##s , ` ` i felt empty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] tears spring to my eyes - o ##of , that was worse than i thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , not like that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , seeing my reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , i felt . . . inadequate . [SEP]
[CLS] like i had nothing inside me to give back to you . [SEP]
[CLS] here you were , so strong , and smart , and intelligent , and i felt like such a failure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m shocked to hear his voice break . [SEP]
[CLS] he clears his throat before he continues . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had failed you . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , everything my dad had ever told me was a lie ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##claim ##s , his voice rising . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in that moment , i do n ' t think i knew if i was capable of love . [SEP]
[CLS] what my father had shown me for years was n ' t love , i do n ' t think , it was control . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt so und ##ese ##r ##ving to be loved by you , and for me to even tell you that i loved you , it would n ' t mean anything , because it would be from someone who was empty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not empty , ' ' i murmur , unable to hear him talk about himself like this even though he broke my heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m starting to realize that . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been good , seeing my mom , talking to her , hearing the truth about my past . [SEP]
[CLS] all the things that you were trying to help me with . [SEP]
[CLS] you were right all along . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t trying to be right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , that ' s not - sorry , this is coming out all wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been thinking about you every day , imagining us meeting up back on campus , and it ' s just happened a lot quicker than i thought it would . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to call you every day , but i needed to make sure i was ready . [SEP]
[CLS] that i had done some work on myself before i tried to reach out to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i know the kind of relationship i want to have with you , and i want to make sure i ' m ready for it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blink at him , feeling confused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what are you saying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m saying that you ' re not my steps ##ister anymore , first of all , ' ' he says with a small grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they filed today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you talked to your dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just once . [SEP]
[CLS] i couch - surf ##ed with friends after you left . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want to stay in the same house with him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him as a realization begins to trickle through my brain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was you , was n ' t it ? [SEP]
[CLS] you got him to give my mom a settlement . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he runs a hand through his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , after talking with my mom , and hearing what happened to her in their divorce , i was worried he would n ' t be fair in dealing with your mom either . [SEP]
[CLS] so , i , um , told him that if he ever wanted to see me again , he ' d have to give your mom some money in the divorce . [SEP]
[CLS] and your tuition , well , i figured after what he put you through , that you deserved it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you did that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , i was n ' t sure it would work . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i was n ' t sure if he wanted to see me again anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think , in his own twisted way , he does love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his very twisted way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he steps forward and reaches for my hand , which is still en ##twined in my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls it down and lace ##s his fingers through mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t promise you that i ' ll know how to be in a normal relationship right away , but please , give me another chance . [SEP]
[CLS] i know how badly i fucked up , but i want to do better . [SEP]
[CLS] please . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to learn with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i pause , uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] can i really put myself out there with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] risk my heart being broken again ? [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him begin to pull my hand gently behind his back so that i ' m forced to take a step in . [SEP]
[CLS] he leans forward , tucking my arm against the small of his back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no fair , ' ' i whisper , as the heat of his body envelope ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] he wraps his other arm around me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' he says with a sly grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but can you blame me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d do anything for another chance with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] everything about him is so into ##xi ##cating . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m dizzy with desire for him after not being near him for close to a month . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn my face up to his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ok , ' ' i re ##lent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one more chance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the words have barely left my lips when he covers my mouth with his . [SEP]
[CLS] my legs almost give out as we touch - a mix of pleasure and relief overwhelming my body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , i ' ve missed you , ' ' he murmurs , breaking away for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull his head back down to mine and sink my tongue into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get a room ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we break away as a group of guys , probably freshmen , walk past us , ho ##oting and ho ##ller ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] nate glare ##s at them for a moment , then rolls his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , there ' s something i ' ve wanted to do for a long time anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leads me by the hand back out of campus and across the street to the crew house . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m wondering if he means something sexual , and worries he forgot his mom is visiting him . [SEP]
[CLS] we walk up the steps and i see her and the crew guys turn to us as we step onto the porch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everyone , this is my girlfriend , bryn ##n , ' ' he announces proudly . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter thirty eileen ' s face breaks into a huge grin as i blush . [SEP]
[CLS] his teammates slap him on the back and needle him about his lack of previous relationships , then begin to introduce themselves to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m quickly offered a beer and pulled into multiple conversations , but nate is there every few minutes with a hand on my back , making sure i ' m ok . as the night goes on , the porch fills up with more people , and , particularly , more women . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m happily overwhelmed by all these new faces , but also glad to just lean on the railing for a minute to sip my beer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear a woman ' s voice call . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to see cara walking up onto the porch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , and stand up to give her a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how was your summer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . . . ' ' i murmur , unable to find the words to describe the last few months . [SEP]
[CLS] i look over her shoulder and watch a girl i do n ' t know place her hand on nate ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] before i can even frown , though , he steps back and smiles politely , then makes his way over to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was pretty crazy , ' ' is all i can come up with before nate ' s arm snakes his way around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just saw my mom ya ##wn ##ing , so i think she ' s about to go back to her hotel , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , hey cara . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nate . . . are you two . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cara asks , her eyes darting back and forth between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are , ' ' i confirm , as nate grins down at me . [SEP]
[CLS] it does feel good to say it out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' ve already met his parents ? [SEP]
[CLS] wow ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , we ' ve met , ' ' i reply a bit eva ##sive ##ly , as nate bites his lip to keep from laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] i elbow him in the ribs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we better go say goodbye to his mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , eileen is shoulder ##ing her purse and looking around as we walk over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope i did n ' t take up too much of your time with nate tonight , ' ' i say as we walk up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not at all . [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t be here at all if it were n ' t for you , ' ' she says , wrapping me up in a big hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you join us for br ##un ##ch tomorrow before i head back home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at nate , who ' s looking at me encouraging ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d love to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great , i ' ll see you tomorrow then ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she says , giving nate a hug before walking down the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it weird that i want to be friends with your mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask him as we watch her get into her car . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not weird ##er than sleeping with your step ##bro ##ther , ' ' he murmurs wicked ##ly in my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think you ' ve had enough of this party ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shiver at the implication of his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nods over his shoulder toward the front door of the house and i follow him inside . [SEP]
[CLS] the living room has several people in it now , but he continues up the steps and to his bedroom down the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there is n ' t going to be another girl under your covers , is there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask him teasing ##ly as he opens the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns to me with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only you now , bryn ##n . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me across the threshold , shutting the door behind me and then pressing me up against it . [SEP]
[CLS] my body lights up with desire as his mouth covers mine and he pulls my arms over my head , keeping them pinned to the door with one hand over my wrists . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his other hand pulling up the hem of my summer dress as his legs push between mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` alright if this one ' s a little quick ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , ni ##bbling on my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just want to feel you , ' ' i breathe , arching my back and pressing my breasts onto his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] with a grunt , he pulls away , reaching into his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull my dress over my head as he yank ##s his zipper down and pushes his boxers and k ##hak ##is to his knees , rolling the condom over his length . [SEP]
[CLS] i barely manage to get my panties to the floor when he steps back into me , grabbing my ass and ho ##ist ##ing me up . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan as i feel his tip press against my opening . [SEP]
[CLS] i must have tightened up a bit in the time we ' ve spent apart because there ' s a shot of pain as he slides me down his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my arms around the back of his neck and lock my ankles just above his ass as he leans me back against the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh fuck , ' ' he murmurs as he reaches his depth inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] he circles his hips , letting me feel him inside me at every angle before pulling back out again . [SEP]
[CLS] i marvel at his strength as he ' s able to hold me in place and thrust in and out of me with almost no support from me . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain is gone by just his third thrust , and pleasure begins to course through my veins . [SEP]
[CLS] my toes curl and i run my hands through his hair , then lean forward and slide my tongue inside his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] to my surprise , he steps away from the door , wrapping one arm around my back to keep me supported . [SEP]
[CLS] he sinks down onto the edge of his bed so that i ' m sitting on top of him . [SEP]
[CLS] i unlock my ankles and move my legs so that i ' m kneeling on the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] i rise up onto my knees as he leans back on his hands , getting used to the feeling of riding him . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach my arms back , bringing my hands to the top of his thighs as i slide down him , feeling him stretching me open . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s hitting me in all the right places and i begin to move faster and faster . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep my eyes open , watching as his mouth drops open and his jaw clench ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] i love seeing that i ' m pushing him right to the edge even as an orgasm is quickly building inside of me . [SEP]
[CLS] his hips begin to pick up off the bed , slamming into me as i sink down . [SEP]
[CLS] the extra power is just what i need , and i feel myself explode on top of him just as he begins to cry out . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep rising up and down as i come , feeling how slick i am inside . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me tight against him , resting his head between my breasts , as we both take deep , gasping breaths . [SEP]
[CLS] but he ' s not done yet . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hands creep up to my bra strap , un ##ho ##oki ##ng it and sliding it down my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] even though i ' m exhausted , i lean back and lift up my arms so he can slide it all the way off . [SEP]
[CLS] he toss ##es it onto a nearby chair then sighs and runs his fingers down my neck , across my cl ##avi ##cle , then down my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i missed you , ' ' he murmurs kissing me softly in the middle of my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i bend my head down and kiss his hair ##line , then reach down and tug at his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] he obe ##die ##ntly lifts his arms up so i can slide it off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm , ' ' i mutter as i lean forward against him , re ##lish ##ing the skin - to - skin contact . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly i feel him lift me up and turn me around , deposit ##ing me with my back on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he reaches down to hold the condom on as he pulls out of me , grabbing a tissue from his side table and finally kicking his pants and underwear all the way off . [SEP]
[CLS] he slides back next to me on the bed as i glance around his room . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s neat in here , as i ' d expect , except for floor - to - ceiling shelves next to his metal desk that are over ##flow ##ing with textbooks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` had to have them put in , ' ' he says , seeing me looking at them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' ll give you the tour later . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hand slide over my hips , pulling me toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] that hand slowly inches down as his tongue slides against mine , now working slowly , his urgency gone . [SEP]
[CLS] he groans as he feels the wet ##ness between my legs and slides one finger inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb just graz ##es my clit and i gasp , pressing back against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do i still get to order you around in bed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , please , ' ' i whimper , closing my eyes as he begins to circle his thumb . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , ' ' he murmurs , and his fingers pull away , but are immediately replaced by his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i moan as he takes a long lick of me , pulling my legs apart and rep ##osition ##ing his body between them . [SEP]
[CLS] he holds my knees out wide , opening me to him completely . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue moves down to my opening , darting in and out of me - such a different sensation than his fingers or his cock . [SEP]
[CLS] as he moves up again to my clit , flicking his tongue mer ##ci ##lessly back and forth across it , i feel another orgasm begin to pool deep in my belly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , wait , come here , ' ' i say , touching his hand on my knee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to taste you , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looks up at me with a grin , and sits up . [SEP]
[CLS] i press my legs together and he works his way up my body on his knees . [SEP]
[CLS] i pin my arms to my sides as he comes up and knee ##ls on either side of my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i pick up my head and he takes his hard cock in his hand , placing it between my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] i can taste the late ##x of the condom we just used , mixed with both of our own scents . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck , bryn ##n , ' ' he growls as he slowly presses his hips forward until his cock hits the back of my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] he begins to move a little faster , but he ' s careful not to over ##w ##helm me , knowing that i ' m completely helpless under him . [SEP]
[CLS] i keep my eyes on his face as sweat begins to break out on his brow and his neck muscles tense . [SEP]
[CLS] with a groan , he pulls out of my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` turn over , ' ' he orders me as he swings one leg over me so that i can follow his command . [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , feeling my breasts sq ##uis ##h against the plain blue comfort ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the rip of another condom and a moment later he lies down on top of me , sweeping my hair off the back of my neck as he does so . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his breath on my ear as his cock pushes inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so wet and he drives deep inside - maybe it ' s the position , but i do n ' t know if i ' ve ever felt him so deep before . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls out and moves back in slowly , eli ##cit ##ing a long cry from me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel tears spring to my eyes at the intensity of the sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` squeeze your legs together , ' ' he whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] i inch them together , feeling my muscles clench even more tightly around his dick . [SEP]
[CLS] his legs are on either side of me now , and i can feel that he has more traction as he thrusts in harder now . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue finds my ear and my body begins to shake as his tongue flick ##s inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear myself begin to moan as though it ' s coming from someone else , though i also feel completely at one with my body and his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , yes , fuck , ' ' he grunt ##s on top of me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come with me , come with me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i have no choice but to obey again , un ##rave ##ling beneath him as he releases himself inside me . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few final strokes , i feel him let go of his weight , relaxing on top of me . [SEP]
[CLS] his nose nu ##zzle ##s into the side of my cheek , his lips just finding the edge of my mouth to give me a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know what the best part is ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i murmur back , my tired brain unable to follow his train of thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can stay the night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue ` ` man , i ' m glad this place has central air , ' ' i say , setting down the last of the boxes in our new apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sweating even with it on , and use the bottom of my t - shirt to wipe my forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i thought boston was supposed to be cooler than virginia , ' ' nate says , shaking his head with a smile as he ho ##ists a box onto the counter as though it weighed nothing , though i know for a fact it has our heavy dishes in it . [SEP]
[CLS] we flew up here for a weekend last month to find an apartment , and were quite lucky that this charles ##town two - bedroom was just our third stop . [SEP]
[CLS] the real ##tor described the neighborhood as ` ` up - and - coming , ' ' and nate loved the cozy feel and exposed brick . [SEP]
[CLS] neither of us start our jobs in town for another week , but i ' m glad we came early . [SEP]
[CLS] we have all the un ##pack ##ing to do , we still need a lot of furniture . . . ` ` are you going to get tired of me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] nate asks , walking over and wrapping his arms around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` living together , you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] absolutely . [SEP]
[CLS] are you going to get sick of me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' he says , nodding seriously , then he grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , too , ' ' i reply as he leans in to kiss me . [SEP]
[CLS] once such a big deal for him to say , nate now tells me he loves me regularly . [SEP]
[CLS] i sq ##ui ##rm happily as his tongue darts quickly against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] a year later , and his kisses still make me weak in the knees . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that box ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask as he releases me and i glance over his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , looking around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there , ' ' i say , pointing to a medium - sized box sitting where we plan to put the couch , when we get one . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dunn ##o , ' ' he says with a shrug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` clothes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mm , no , i do n ' t think so , ' ' i reply , walking over to it and picking it up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s really light . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake it and can just hear the cr ##ink ##ling of paper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s weird . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i set it back down on the floor and knee ##l next to it , scratching at the corner of the packing tape sealing it shut . [SEP]
[CLS] i finally get enough up to get my finger under it , and pull it across the boxes flaps . [SEP]
[CLS] nick comes to stand near me as i pull it open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really do n ' t remember packing this one , but maybe i ' m going crazy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it has been an event ##ful week . [SEP]
[CLS] we graduated last weekend , and played host to both of our mom ##s , and then just a few days later we were driving up to boston . [SEP]
[CLS] we both managed to secure jobs here , nate with a historical society , and me in the research side of a non - profit . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull the brown packing paper out of the box , pi ##ling it on the floor next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh dear , did i pack an empty box ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , just as my fingers close around a much smaller box at the bottom of the larger one . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s . . . ' ' my eyes widen as i realize i ' m holding a jewelry box . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up at nate , who ' s grinning at me . [SEP]
[CLS] he knee ##ls down onto the hardwood floor next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , ' ' i murmur , as he takes the small box out of my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] of course we ' ve discussed marriage , but i did n ' t think he would propose so soon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bryn ##n , ' ' he whispers , ` ` i ' ve come alive since i met you . [SEP]
[CLS] my world before you came into it was cold and dark , and then you showed up and brought light into it . [SEP]
[CLS] every day , i find a new reason to fall more in love with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i know we ' re still young , but i want so much to have the honor of calling you my wife . [SEP]
[CLS] will you marry me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , opening the box . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at the simple , beautiful diamond ring sitting in the middle of the red velvet box as my eyes fill with tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , yes , of course i ' ll marry you , ' ' i gasp , wrapping my arms around his neck and covering him with kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughs joy ##ously and lifts me off the ground with his free arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , try it on , ' ' he finally says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i measured your ring finger while you were sleeping . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sneak ##y ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tease him as he slips the ring on my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a perfect fit , ' ' i say , holding it toward the nearest window so the light catches it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` should we call your mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , wrapping his arms back around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s wait until tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] for today , only you and i will know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only you , ' ' he echoes , pressing his forehead against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the end chapter one ` ` i thought you said this was going to be a small gathering , ' ' i shout , raising my voice above the b ##lar ##ing music . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the pounding bass line vibrating through my body as i hesitate at the edge of the gigantic house party . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did i say that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my best friend , riley , grins back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i meant to say that this was going to be an ' epic rage ##r unlike anything you ' ve ever seen ' . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i roll my eyes at her as we ' re swallowed up by the tee ##ming crowd of our classmates . [SEP]
[CLS] i should have known better than to think that riley would spend her saturday night anywhere but at a legendary party . [SEP]
[CLS] she and i have been best friends for all seventeen years we ' ve been on the planet . [SEP]
[CLS] but even so , our ideas of what makes a ` ` good time ' ' are stark ##ly different . [SEP]
[CLS] if i had any sense at all , i would never have let her drag me to this party . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d much rather be curled up at home with my sketch pad and a cup of tea . [SEP]
[CLS] but seeing that the damage is done , i suppose there ' s nothing to do but try and have a good time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here you go ladies , ' ' a bu ##rly junior boy says , sid ##ling up to us with a red plastic cup in either hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first drink ' s on me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` warm beer , now with extra roof ##ies ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley says , cock ##ing a perfect eyebrow at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re all set , champ , ' ' i tell the boy , producing a fl ##ask full of my dad ' s very fine whiskey from my purse . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not like he ' s using it much , these days . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` better luck next time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a couple of buzz kills , ' ' the kid gr ##umble ##s , sul ##king away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great party so far ri , ' ' i laugh sarcastically , un ##sc ##rew ##ing the top of the fl ##ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just remember , abby - in less than a year , we ' ll never have to deal with high school boys again , ' ' she points out , accepting the fl ##ask as i pass it her way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t wait , ' ' i say wi ##st ##fully , ` ` i know you ' re not supposed to wish away your youth or whatever , but the sooner high school can be over with , the better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not enjoying your glory days ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks with mock astonishment , gesturing toward our fellow party ##go ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] i look around at the party un ##folding all around us . [SEP]
[CLS] some rich kid ' s parents are out of town , and the entire school has descended on their mc ##mans ##ion to spend the night getting wasted , listening to someone ' s crap ##py ipod play ##list , and making questionable choices about who to sleep with . [SEP]
[CLS] i nearly step on two people going at it right in the foyer , writhing all over each other in a drunken ti ##zzy . [SEP]
[CLS] with a wild yell , some kid tries to swing on the crystal chan ##del ##ier , only to miss and fall flat on his face to on ##lo ##oke ##rs ' up ##ro ##ario ##us laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if these are our glory days , ' ' i say to riley , ` ` we ' re in serious trouble . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' she laughs , slipping her fingers through mine , ` ` i ' m sure we can find a quieter corner somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] there must be , like , a hundred rooms in this place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i let riley tug me off through the party , ignoring the tips ##y dude ##s who make lesbian jokes about us along the way . [SEP]
[CLS] as gorgeous as my best friend is , with her silky black curls , tanned skin , and amazing curves , i ' ve never been the least bit interested in ` ` experimenting ' ' with her . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve only ever loved each other as sisters . [SEP]
[CLS] but the fact that i ' ve never had a real boyfriend leads some people in my school to question whether i ' m into guys at all . [SEP]
[CLS] the short answer is , i ' m plenty into guys . [SEP]
[CLS] but finding one that ' s worth the time of day at my connecticut high school has proven to be impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] well . . . just about impossible , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] the party is just a forest of legs and torso ##s from my vantage point . [SEP]
[CLS] at five foot three , i ' m what you might call ` ` vertically challenged ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] being petite is great for hide - and - seek , but not so great for feeling like anything close to an adult . [SEP]
[CLS] or being treated like one . [SEP]
[CLS] but in a couple weeks ' time , the world will have no choice but to acknowledge my adulthood - at long last , i ' ll finally be turning eighteen . [SEP]
[CLS] the only question that remains is how quickly i can get out of town and be on my own once i ' m officially a grown - up . [SEP]
[CLS] as riley and i climb the sweeping staircase and sid ##le into the master bedroom suite , we pass a passed out classmate who ' s had his face graffiti ##ed with permanent marker penis ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] yep . [SEP]
[CLS] adulthood ca n ' t come soon enough . [SEP]
[CLS] we poke our heads into the master bedroom , and i note with relief that it ' s far quieter in this corner of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe we can just hang out here and ride out this shit show in peace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - oh , ' ' riley mutter ##s , glancing down at me with a wicked glint in her eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look who ' s here , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i peer around my best friend , scanning the dozen or so people already hanging out in the master bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] it only takes half a second for me to see who it is she ' s talking about . [SEP]
[CLS] my solar pl ##ex ##us rocks on its axis as a very familiar set of blue eyes turns my way from across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i squeak , duck ##ing back around riley ' s taller form . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know he was going to be here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the entire school is here , abby , ' ' riley laughs , ` ` you could have guessed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s supposed to be too cool for this sort of thing . [SEP]
[CLS] or whatever , ' ' i say , rolling my hazel eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think he saw me . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s just go - ' ' ` ` hey , sis ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a rough baritone calls from across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing here ? [SEP]
[CLS] is n ' t it past your bed ##time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i groan as a volley of chuckles goes up around the room , and turn to see emerson sawyer , my blue - eyed nightmare , st ##riding toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s easily six feet tall , with broad shoulders , a tape ##red torso , and effortlessly defined muscles . [SEP]
[CLS] his mo ##p of shaggy , chestnut brown hair is art ##fully to ##us ##led , a stray lock sw ##ooping across his forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s making jeans and a crimson tee shirt look as good as a three piece suit , and has a lit cigarette cradled in his full , firm lips . [SEP]
[CLS] naturally , my personal nightmare looks like an absolute dream come true . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t call me that in public . [SEP]
[CLS] or ever , ' ' i tell him , crossing my arms to hide the fact that my heart is slamming against my rib ##ca ##ge at his approach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not , sis ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins ra ##kis ##hly , taking a long drag of his smoke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because it ' s creepy as hell , ' ' i reply , exasperated , tucking my long , ash blonde hair behind my ears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and it ' s not even true . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure it is . [SEP]
[CLS] for all intent ##s and purposes , ' ' he shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve known emerson sawyer for nearly four years , now . [SEP]
[CLS] or , rather , i ' ve known of him for four years . [SEP]
[CLS] our connecticut town has two elementary schools that feed into the same high school . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i attended separate grade schools , which were pretty stark ##ly divided between the richer and poorer families in town , but ended up at the same high school together . [SEP]
[CLS] i noticed him the very first day of freshman year , when he mouthed off to our sex ed teacher for taking a hard line in favor of abs ##tine ##nce ( the most characteristic ##ally emerson thing ever ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he , on the other hand , had no idea i existed . [SEP]
[CLS] until this year , that is , when both of our lives - personal and social - got turned upside down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the matter ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ashamed to have a brother from the wrong side of the tracks ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson presses , jo ##st ##ling me out of my thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t put that on me , ' ' i snap back , ` ` as if you can stand having a pri ##ss ##y rich girl for a would - be - sister . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are kind of a bum ##mer , ' ' he says flatly , ` ` but if it makes you feel any better , it ' s your personality i hold against you , not your money . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare word ##lessly at emerson , knocked into sul ##len silence once again by his master ##ful put ##down . [SEP]
[CLS] by now , but emerson has figured out exactly how to get to me . [SEP]
[CLS] about two months ago , i got the shock of my life when my widow ##er father , robert rowan , announced that , after four years of refusing to date , he had just met the new love of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] her name was deborah , he told me . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d met at aa and ` ` really hit it off ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] he talked about her inc ##ess ##antly , stayed out all night like he was a teenager again , and generally weird ##ed the hell out of me . [SEP]
[CLS] after just two weeks , dad told me that he was in love , and wanted to introduce this deborah to me as soon as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] i beg ##rud ##gingly agreed to be around for dinner the following night to meet his mystery woman . [SEP]
[CLS] we lost my mother sandy to a terrible car accident just before i started high school , so the idea of a new woman in my father ' s life was a little hard to swallow . [SEP]
[CLS] still , i did my best to put on a happy face and be as supportive as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been very good at saying ` ` no ' ' or standing up to my dad , so it ' s not like i had much of a choice . [SEP]
[CLS] as our doorbell rang the next night , signaling deborah ' s grand entrance into our family ' s life , my dad asked me to answer the door . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t until i was en route that he mentioned deborah ' s son would also be joining us for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] when i swung open the door to welcome our guest and her plus one , i ' m surprised that my jaw did n ' t crack from hitting the floor so hard . [SEP]
[CLS] there , standing on my doorstep , was emerson sawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] and i could tell from the blank , di ##sin ##ter ##ested look in his eye that he had no idea who i was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson interrupt ##s my thoughts , grinning as he snatch ##es the metallic fl ##ask out of my back pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] a trail of sensation sears along the skin just above my belt as his fingers brush against my bare flesh . [SEP]
[CLS] goose ##bu ##mps spring up where his fingertips glanced against my body . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s like my every cell is hard - wired to respond to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to give each and every one of those cells a stern talking - to . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson knocks back a slug of boo ##ze without checking to see what it is first , and lets out a ra ##uc ##ous ho ##ot as he tastes the strong whiskey . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you brought the good stuff ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he crows , dr ##ap ##ing a muscled arm across my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this must be from daddy ' s st ##ash , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give it back , sawyer , ' ' i demand , trying half - hearted ##ly to push him away from me . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' m being perfectly honest , the feel of his hard , solid body against mine is something i ' ll never stop secretly jones ##ing for - but he can never know that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , sis . [SEP]
[CLS] sharing is caring , ' ' he tease ##s , holding the fl ##ask up in the air , just out of my reach . [SEP]
[CLS] mocking my height - or lack thereof - is one of his favorite ho ##bbies . [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh , refusing to engage in his game . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , i miss the days where emerson did n ' t even know my name . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t go to a gigantic school - there are about three hundred kids in our senior class . [SEP]
[CLS] so for the first three years of high school , i was able to harbor a huge , un ##re ##qui ##ted crush on emerson without ever actually having to speak to him . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s a lacrosse player , part of the ` ` in ' ' crowd . [SEP]
[CLS] because our school is so diverse , socio - economically speaking , popularity does n ' t depend on how much money your family has . [SEP]
[CLS] if it did , i might actually be known around school as something other than ` ` that short girl who ' s always drawing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] but the gods of popularity did not decide to favor me , it would seem . [SEP]
[CLS] my very petite , ne ##rdy , soft - spoken self is just about invisible in the halls of mcc ##ar ##ren high school . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , these days , the thing i ' m best known for there is being the daughter of the guy emerson ' s ` ` hot mom ' ' is dating . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , good ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just take the damn fl ##ask , ' ' i mutter , turning on my heel to go , ` ` i ' m out of here anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] enjoy yourself , sawyer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] but as i attempt to make my grand exit , emerson steps directly into my path , his staggering ##ly built body blocking my way . [SEP]
[CLS] i col ##lide with his muscular form , my hands landing flush against his abdomen . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to swallow a moan as i feel his insane ##ly cut six pack rip ##pling beneath my fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] i step quickly away , catching riley ' s amused gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] she knows all about my feelings for emerson , being my best friend and all . [SEP]
[CLS] hopefully , the other dozen people here in this room ca n ' t see right through me , too . [SEP]
[CLS] especially emerson himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be such a down ##er , ' ' he laughs , handing me the fl ##ask and ex ##ting ##uis ##hing his smoke in someone ' s discarded red cup . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stay and have fun for once in your life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a down ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re just a pain in the ass , ' ' i reply , snatch ##ing the fl ##ask out of his strong hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a very troubled childhood , ' ' he says over - dramatically , laying a hand over his heart and arranging his features into an anguish ##ed po ##ut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t help myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who am i , officer k ##rup ##ke ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , laughing despite myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me a break . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s no wonder emerson is so popular , with his wicked sense of humor , his bad boy good looks , and his devil - may - care attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] he could have his pick of any girl in our school , of that much i am absolutely certain . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been keeping careful tab ##s on his romantic life for years now , and he definitely does n ' t seem to be the ` ` relationship type ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s hanging out with a new girl every weekend , just about . [SEP]
[CLS] and it seems that this weekend is no exception . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey emerson , ' ' a breath ##y voice says from over his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] two thin , mani ##cured hands slide around his torso from behind , and a beautiful , green - eyed face peek ##s around his built form . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart clench ##es painfully as i recognize courtney hai ##nes , a gorgeous redhead ##ed girl in our senior class . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s our resident the ##sp ##ian , the beautiful star of every single school play , talent show , and choir concert . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' ll probably head to new york after graduation and become some broadway sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] but right now , she seems pretty happy in the role of girl who gets to make out with emerson sawyer tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to admit , i would be too . [SEP]
[CLS] stop that , i chi ##de myself , shaking off my discomfort . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not allowed to like him like that anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] your parents are dating . [SEP]
[CLS] plus , he thinks of you as an annoying little g ##nat . . . when he thinks of you at all . [SEP]
[CLS] get a grip , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey riley . [SEP]
[CLS] hey abby , ' ' courtney hai ##nes says , dr ##ap ##ing emerson ' s arm over her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` glad you guys could make it to my little shin ##di ##g ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is your house ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , looking around in wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad ' s place is pretty state ##ly , but her home is truly a den of luxury . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s more of an estate than anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] our area of connecticut is cho ##ck full of gigantic homes , but her family ' s puts them all to shame . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . [SEP]
[CLS] and would be my room , ' ' she smiles smug ##ly , letting her hand travel down into emerson ' s back pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my parents were nice enough to give me the master suite and everything , their dear hearts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how nice , ' ' riley says flatly , stepping up beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] riley ' s family is distinctly working - class , and the trapping ##s of wealth have never interested her much . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s never held my family ' s financial situation against me , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] but that ' s only because i ' m aware of the privilege that comes along with having a family that ' s ` ` old money ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] she has no patience for the rich kids in our school who seem oblivious to how good they have it . [SEP]
[CLS] and courtney is most certainly one of that number . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on babe , ' ' the redhead ##ed girl says to emerson , ` ` we ' re just about to play a little game . [SEP]
[CLS] you girls should play too ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what sort of game are we talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks , stealing a ni ##p of my boo ##ze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` darts ? [SEP]
[CLS] poker ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seven minutes in heaven , ' ' courtney sq ##ue ##als , bouncing up and down excitedly on the balls of her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blur ##t out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' courtney replies , mi ##ffed by my less - than - enthusiastic response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the problem ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re doing it ironically . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re some kind of hips ##ter , are n ' t you ? [SEP]
[CLS] you should appreciate that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a hips ##ter , ' ' i reply , ` ` i just like to read , occasionally . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson tries to cover up a heart ##y chuckle with a cough . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over at him , amazed . [SEP]
[CLS] did i actually just make my det ##rac ##tor - in - residence laugh ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever , ' ' courtney chi ##rp ##s , towing emerson back toward the group , ` ` join in or do n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get out of here , ' ' i mutter to riley , as emerson strides away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and miss your chance to wind up in the closet with your ot ##l ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grins back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask blankly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your one true love , obviously , ' ' she says , loop ##ing an arm around my waist and dragging me toward the group . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh please , ' ' i whisper , ` ` it was just a crush ! [SEP]
[CLS] and besides , it ' s over now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' she says , rolling her eyes , ` ` because i did n ' t just see you fa ##wn over his six pack for a long , steam ##y moment back there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t fa ##wn over anything , ' ' i hiss , ` ` i just - ' ' ` ` ok ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] courtney chi ##rp ##s , rubbing her hands together and looking around at her assembled guests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s do this . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone know the rules of seven minutes in heaven ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes land on me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ha . [SEP]
[CLS] ha . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i murmur , wanting very badly to melt into a puddle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , i know the rules . [SEP]
[CLS] i was in eighth grade once , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the group chuckles , surprised by my sw ##ipe at the queen bee . [SEP]
[CLS] courtney is n ' t the kind of girl who gets talked back to very often . [SEP]
[CLS] which , in my opinion , is why she should be talked back to at every opportunity . [SEP]
[CLS] even emerson cock ##s his head at me in something that looks faintly like admiration . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , something other than generally bored disdain , which is his default attitude toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . [SEP]
[CLS] so who wants to pick our first two victims ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] courtney asks , her green eyes sparkling with mischief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me ! [SEP]
[CLS] di ##bs ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley says firmly , thrusting her hand into the air before anyone else has a chance to . [SEP]
[CLS] a cold stab of panic rip ##s through me as my best friend smiles wicked ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great , ' ' courtney chi ##rp ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` riley , you start . [SEP]
[CLS] who should we stick in the closet first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you dare , ' ' i mutter under my breath , ` ` riley , i mean it - ' ' ` ` emerson and abby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley crows triumphant ##ly , shooting me a smile that clearly says , you know you want it . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll thank me for this someday . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' courtney replies , the corners of her pretty mouth turning down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess that ' s fine . [SEP]
[CLS] if you ' re into inc ##est or whatever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] our classmates laugh with delight as that taboo word drift ##s through the air like some smoke from one of emerson ' s cigarettes . [SEP]
[CLS] a deep pang of shame twists my core . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve spent many a sleep ##less night be ##rating myself for still being attracted to emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve hurled the ` ` i word ' ' at myself a million times , hoping to break the spell he ' s cast over me . [SEP]
[CLS] but no dice . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how wrong the rest of the world might think it is , i ' m crazy for this gorgeous , cool , sneak ##ily intelligent boy . [SEP]
[CLS] our parents little affair ca n ' t change that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` super twisted , riley , ' ' emerson laughs , crossing his thick arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] courtney ' s eyes flash with jealousy as she swings her gaze my way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' she snaps , clearly annoyed not to be heading into the closet with emerson herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you two had better make good on it . [SEP]
[CLS] no t ##wi ##ddling your thumbs in there . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll want some proof that you actually did something . [SEP]
[CLS] right everyone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a chorus of assent ##ing murmurs sounds off around the circle . [SEP]
[CLS] i look around at my classmates , be ##fu ##ddled and humiliated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell kind of proof do you want ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , ` ` i ' m not the sex tape sort ##a gal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` figure it out yourself , ' ' courtney sniff ##s , shoving emerson toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can thank your best ##ie riley for her suggestion . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks best ##ie , ' ' emerson grins at riley , coming to a stop in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] he makes a grand sweeping gesture , offering his arm as if we were going to a ball . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ma ' am ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tease ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s just get this over with , ' ' i gr ##umble , storm ##ing past him to the closet door . [SEP]
[CLS] the crowd makes kiss ##y noises as i wren ##ch open the door and march inside with emerson on my heels . [SEP]
[CLS] as i step into the space , i ' m taken aback . [SEP]
[CLS] i was expecting some kind of coat closet , with barely enough room to move around . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , courtney ' s closet is an enormous walk - in affair , with rows and rows of clothing , shoes , and accessories lining the huge space . [SEP]
[CLS] her closet is fan ##cier , and perhaps even as big , as my bedroom at home . [SEP]
[CLS] there are golden - plate ##d fixtures , a spark ##ly chan ##del ##ier hanging overhead , and a decade ##nt , velvet faint ##ing sofa standing front - and - center . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson steps up beside me as both of our gazes fall on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] we steal simultaneous glances at each other , then quickly look away . [SEP]
[CLS] my cheeks flame red as i try and di ##sl ##od ##ge the sexy image playing out in my mind ' s eye : emerson laying me out across that sofa , ripping my clothes off , and having his way with me as the smooth velvet up ##hol ##ster ##y caress ##es my bare skin . [SEP]
[CLS] he , on the other hand , is probably preoccupied with counting down the minutes before this little joke is over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is why i never come to parties , ' ' i murmur , crossing my arms tightly across my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? [SEP]
[CLS] i thought it was ' cause no one ever asked you to , ' ' he says wryly , taking a seat on the faint ##ing sofa and stretching out his long , toned body . [SEP]
[CLS] torment ##ing me , is more like it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would have expected you to have better plans , at least , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we need to start coordinating with each other so this does n ' t happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what , this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , gesturing around at the closet as our seven minutes un ##fold . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not this specifically , ' ' i say , rolling my eyes , ` ` i just mean we should avoid seeing each other any more than we absolutely have to . [SEP]
[CLS] especially now that you and your mother . . . ' ' i trail off , shaking my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since we what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson snaps , suddenly on the defensive , ` ` invaded your precious ivory tower ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip , intimidated by his heated tone . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad and deborah have recently decided to move in together . [SEP]
[CLS] or rather , they ' ve decided that deborah and emerson are going to move in with us . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re going to rent out their apartment on the other side of town and shack up in our place for the time being . [SEP]
[CLS] one big , utterly strange , less - than - happy family . [SEP]
[CLS] as if crushing on emerson was n ' t weird enough for me , now the object of my unfortunate desire is going to be sleeping under the same roof , as well . [SEP]
[CLS] college really ca n ' t start soon enough for me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to admit , it ' s kind of strange , ' ' i murmur , ave ##rting my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad and deborah ' s whole thing , i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve known each other for , what , two months ? [SEP]
[CLS] and they ' re already moving in together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mom ' s a crazy , imp ##ulsive bitch , ' ' emerson shrugs , ` ` and your dad seems like someone who does whatever the fuck he wants without thinking about the consequences . [SEP]
[CLS] what about this is surprising to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good point , ' ' i laugh hollow ##ly , daring to sit on the very edge of the couch beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] the mere proximity of his body to mine has my stomach twisting in anxious knots . [SEP]
[CLS] has it been seven minutes yet or what ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' emerson sighs , swinging his legs around so that he ' s sitting beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are we go ##n na get it on now or what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u ##gh , ' ' i groan , giving him a shove , ` ` stop it , would you ? [SEP]
[CLS] why do you get so much pleasure out of making me miserable ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t , ' ' he replies , ` ` it ' s just so goddamn easy that i ca n ' t help myself . [SEP]
[CLS] how the hell did you get to be such a little pr ##ude ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who says i ' m a pr ##ude ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back , ` ` you do n ' t know anything about my life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that i ' ve never seen you even talk to a guy , ' ' emerson shoots back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' re you , keeping track of my lovers or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get a life , sawyer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] of course , i do n ' t mind at all that emerson ' s taking notice of my love life , pal ##try though it may be . [SEP]
[CLS] as insane as it is , i ca n ' t help but hope that there ' s some chance he could come to feel the same way about me as i do him . [SEP]
[CLS] call me a dreamer , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] a dirty dreamer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are brothers for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson grins , slipping an arm around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] my head sets to spinning as the near ##ness of him entrances me . [SEP]
[CLS] i look up at his gorgeous , sculpted face , mere inches away from my own . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been this close to him before . [SEP]
[CLS] i memo ##rize the con ##tour ##s of his perfect features - his high cheekbones , his a ##quil ##ine nose , the sc ##ruff along his razor sharp jaw , and of course those dark blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] from this close , i can see that there are spec ##ks of gold gleaming in his iris ##es , and a dash of fr ##eck ##les across the bridge of his nose . [SEP]
[CLS] at last , my eyes land firmly on his full , firm lips , half curled into a devil ##ish grin . [SEP]
[CLS] his arm is still circled around my tiny waist . [SEP]
[CLS] am i imagining things , or is his grip growing the slightest bit tighter ? [SEP]
[CLS] a silence blooms over us , heavy and thick . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes flick back up to his . [SEP]
[CLS] a cast of seriousness has come over his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] to my amazement , i watch as his face moves closer to mine , by barely a mill ##imeter - ` ` five minutes ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear courtney call from outside the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit , ' ' i mutter , tearing my eyes away from his perfect face . [SEP]
[CLS] my whole body is on fire with scattered anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] for a second there , i actually thought he was going to kiss me . [SEP]
[CLS] talk about wish ##ful thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . [SEP]
[CLS] how are we going to please the horn ##y masses ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , nodding toward the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have an idea , ' ' emerson says , his grin returning at full force . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to give me your panties . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my jaw falls open as i whip around to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sp ##lu ##tter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you heard me . [SEP]
[CLS] hand them over , ' ' emerson says , punching me lightly on the arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can hold them up as proof that we did the deed , and everyone will know that you ' re not a fr ##ig ##id , virgin ##al weird ##o . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is so messed up , ' ' i say , jumping to my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just going to leave the whole ` ` fr ##ig ##id virgin ' ' thing alone for now , i decide . [SEP]
[CLS] no use opening that can of worms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let those asshole ##s think what they want . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll never have to see any of them again in a few months . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , sis . [SEP]
[CLS] do it for me , then , ' ' emerson says , standing to meet me . [SEP]
[CLS] he catches my arm , giving me a soft tug toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you want to help me protect my reputation ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not really , ' ' i reply , as he closes the space between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder if he can see my heart pounding through my black sweater , see my knees trembling beneath my tar ##tan mini ##ski ##rt ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i ask you nicely ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he returns , his voice softer , hu ##skie ##r than i ' ve ever heard it . [SEP]
[CLS] he runs his hands down my arms , not an inch of air between our bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] that seriousness has hardened his features once again . . . or is he just fucking with me ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you really capable of that ? [SEP]
[CLS] asking nicely ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i try to joke , but my own voice seems to have dropped a lust ##y octave . [SEP]
[CLS] my breath catches in my throat as his hands land firmly on my slender hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me your panties , ' ' he growls , his fingers tightening ever - so - slightly , ` ` please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare up at him in amazement . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s totally serious . [SEP]
[CLS] if i had any sense at all , i ' d step away , laugh off his request , and wait for the next five minutes to tick by . [SEP]
[CLS] but my sense has been fully eclipse ##d by my want to please him in any way that i can . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe he ' s joking after all , but i ' m not going to let this moment slip away between my fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to show emerson sawyer what i ' m made of . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s now or never . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to turn around , ' ' i whisper hoarse ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes spark with intrigued wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , silently , he pi ##vot ##s away from me . [SEP]
[CLS] keeping my eyes fixed firmly on his face to make sure he does n ' t peek , i reach up under my skirt and slip my thumbs under the elastic band of my panties . [SEP]
[CLS] thank god i thought to wear one of my sex ##iest pairs tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t usually go for fancy under ##thing ##s , but this black lace g - string is an exception . [SEP]
[CLS] my breath comes hard and fast as i slowly lower my panties over my firm ass and thighs , balancing carefully as i ease them down . [SEP]
[CLS] i step out of them , wo ##bbling just slightly , and shiver as i feel the cool air against my sex . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel myself getting wet , standing so close to emerson , bare and ready . [SEP]
[CLS] god , i hope he wo n ' t be able to tell . [SEP]
[CLS] unless he intends to make good on it , that is . . . ` ` here , ' ' i tell him , holding up the delicate lace g - string . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson turns back to face me , looking taken off guard for the first time since i ' ve known him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` damn , ' ' he murmurs , taking the panties carefully - almost rev ##ere ##ntly - from my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s more to you than i thought , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he called me abby , not ` ` sis ' ' , i think to myself , a grin spreading across my face . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe seven minutes in heaven is n ' t such a terrible game after all . . . ` ` now , my question is , ' ' i begin , easing toward emerson once more , ` ` what do you intend to do with those ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] those soft , sculpted lips part , ever - so - slightly , as he draws in a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' he starts , letting his blue eyes travel down the length of my body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can tell you what i ' d like to - ' ' a shrill scream rings out from somewhere within the massive house , a wave of frantic noise building from below . [SEP]
[CLS] the din rises , tearing my and emerson ' s attention away from each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the pounding music cuts off abruptly , and through the ca ##co ##phon ##y ringing out beneath our feet , a new set of voices can be heard loud and clear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` police ! [SEP]
[CLS] everybody out ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` break it up , break it up ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyone still here in five minutes is under arrest ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck me , ' ' i mutter angrily , shoving a hand through my blonde hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` certainly no time for that now , ' ' emerson laughs roughly , playing off our intense moment . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe i was just imagining that intensity ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll never know now . [SEP]
[CLS] i sq ##uin ##t as bright light floods the closet once more . [SEP]
[CLS] someone ' s ripped open the door , revealing the chaos un ##folding in the master bedroom suite . [SEP]
[CLS] courtney is ba ##wl ##ing frantically as everyone else makes a bee ##line for the exits . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson shove ##s my panties into his pocket just in time , before riley darts into the closet to fetch us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have to go ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she says firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are we going to make it past the cops ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] running from the police is n ' t exactly my strong suit . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily , emerson is a bit more experienced on this front than i . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' he commands , a dared ##ev ##il smile spreading across his face as he takes my wrist in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] riley gives me a big wink as emerson carts me away into the frenzy of escaping party ##go ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] we dive into the fray , the voices of police officers and drunken high school ##ers com ##ming ##ling in a deafening clash . [SEP]
[CLS] as we run along the second story landing , i watch as one inca ##uti ##ous classmate takes a swing at a cop , then finds himself in handcuffs a moment later . [SEP]
[CLS] i stay as close to emerson as i can as he barrels through the crowd , protecting me from the surge of moving bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] we care ##en into an empty bedroom and slam the door behind us , our chests heaving with ex ##ert ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where did riley go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , panicked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no time to look for her , ' ' emerson says gruff ##ly , st ##riding toward the bedroom window , ` ` if i get arrested again , my mom ' s go ##n na ship me off to the army or something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he wren ##ches open the window and kicks the screen clear out of the frame . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that really necessary ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hiss , as he peers out into the night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jack ##pot , ' ' he says , ignoring my question , ` ` we can climb right down this tre ##llis . [SEP]
[CLS] and your dad ' s place - sorry , our place - is close enough to make a run for it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how am i supposed to keep up with you , mr . [SEP]
[CLS] varsity athlete ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i demand , planting my hands on my hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` run fast , ' ' he wink ##s , swinging a leg over the window si ##ll . [SEP]
[CLS] i let out a frightening ye ##lp as he disappears out the window , and rush forward to make sure he has n ' t fallen . [SEP]
[CLS] i look on as emerson di ##smo ##unt ##s gracefully onto the lush green grass below , looking up at me expect ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t do that , ' ' i call down to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to , ' ' he insists , ` ` do n ' t be such a little chicken shit , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , i ca n ' t . . . ' ' i trail off , blushing wildly , ` ` you still have my . [SEP]
[CLS] you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a wild , ra ##uc ##ous laugh rip ##s out of emerson ' s throat as he remembers that my panties are still in his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m totally commando . [SEP]
[CLS] and wearing a skirt . [SEP]
[CLS] not exactly the best tre ##llis - climbing attire . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise i wo n ' t peek , ' ' emerson says , getting a hold of himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just come on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no fucking way ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s either sc ##amp ##er down here , bare - ass ##ed , or get arrested . [SEP]
[CLS] your call , ' ' emerson shoots back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty sure your precious colleges wo n ' t be thrilled with your having a criminal record . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip , glancing over my shoulder as the din of the raid reaches its peak . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s right . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m all out of options . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to close your eyes , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean it , sawyer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , yeah , ' ' he says , screwing his eyes shut . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get a move on , weird ##o . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a cool breeze brushes against my most intimate flesh as i sc ##oot onto the window si ##ll . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as strange sensations go , this has to be up near the top . [SEP]
[CLS] checking once more to make sure emerson ' s eyes are really closed , i grab onto the vine - covered tre ##llis beside the window . [SEP]
[CLS] with a deep breath , i swing out into the open air . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been very good with heights , so this is not exactly my idea of a good time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , for fuck ' s sake , ' ' i groan , as the breeze lifts up my skirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , one eye almost cracking open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sc ##ree ##ch , my stomach dropping at the thought of him getting an eye ##ful of my co ##och from down below . [SEP]
[CLS] in a desperate , un ##thi ##nk ##ing moment , i try and smooth down my skirt , losing my grip on the fl ##im ##sy tre ##llis . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my body pitching backward , plum ##met ##ing through the air . [SEP]
[CLS] i brace myself for the impact , waiting to hear my bones crack ##ling as i hit the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the next moment , i feel two thick arms wrap firmly around my small body . [SEP]
[CLS] i blink up at emerson from where i lay cradled in his grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even st ##agger when i fell into his embrace , he ' s that much bigger than i am . [SEP]
[CLS] for a moment , it ' s all we can do to stare at each other in wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re closer than we ' ve ever been before . [SEP]
[CLS] so , so close . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance down at my legs and see that one of emerson ' s hands is gripping my bare ass , full on - the tips of his fingers dangerously close to my exposed sex . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' i say faintly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . . . ' ' he replies , realizing what it is that he ' s got a handful of . [SEP]
[CLS] he lowers me un ##cer ##emon ##iously to my feet , brushing himself off br ##us ##quel ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] am i crazy , or is that a slight blush creeping into his cheeks ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get out of here , ' ' he says gruff ##ly , shoving my panties back into my hands and taking off at a jo ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at his retreating back for a long moment before coming to . [SEP]
[CLS] with trembling hands , i step back into my lacy underwear and set off in his wake . [SEP]
[CLS] no way is he going to wait around for me - i should know that much by now . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter two we spend the next hour darting through the thick , shadowy woods that blanket the town , slowly making our way home . [SEP]
[CLS] barely a word is spoken by either of us as we make our way along , pausing whenever we hear a siren in the distance . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time we stumble through the brush and land in our backyard , i ' m covered in scrape ##s and dirt . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson , for his part , seems to be mostly un ##sca ##thed . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course he is . [SEP]
[CLS] the lights are all out as we tip ##to ##e into my childhood home - a state ##ly but relatively modest tudor house . [SEP]
[CLS] dad and deborah must be asleep by now . [SEP]
[CLS] it is , after all , past two in the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] hopefully dad wo n ' t ask too many questions about what i ' m doing home in the morning - i told him i ' d be sleeping over at riley ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] but he ' s not exactly the type to check up , and i doubt that deborah even goes through the motions of keeping tab ##s on emerson anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] with a little bit of luck , we ' ll be in the clear . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i slip through the back doors and pl ##od up the carpet ##ed staircase , skipping the cr ##eak ##y stair , coming at last to the second story landing . [SEP]
[CLS] there are three bedrooms in my dad ' s house : the master bedroom just off the landing , which he and deborah are sharing now , and two smaller rooms at either side of the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] my room is down to the right , emerson ' s is to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t even bother saying goodnight before turning away and slipping into his room . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , i tr ##udge back to my own quarters at the opposite end of the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] closing the door gently behind me , i belly flop onto my bed , burying my face in the fluffy pillow and fighting the urge to scream . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t sort through everything that happened between emerson and i tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] between the tense moments during seven minutes of heaven to his accidental but steam ##y caress after i took a tumble off the tre ##llis , i ' m totally at a loss . [SEP]
[CLS] tonight was the first time we ' ve seen each other outside of school and home since he and deborah moved in . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s certainly the first time anything so . . . charged has passed between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i flip over onto my back , staring up at the ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] the glow - in - the - dark stars i put up as a kid still hang overhead , despite my near - adult status . [SEP]
[CLS] with a pang of heart ##ache , i realize that emerson and i are bound to part ways once we turn eighteen and graduate high school . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll never know what could have been between us , if our parents had n ' t ruined everything by getting together . [SEP]
[CLS] then again , he probably never would have even learned my name if not for them . [SEP]
[CLS] so i guess i should be somewhat grateful . [SEP]
[CLS] emphasis on somewhat . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that i ' ll never fall asleep with all this tension built up inside of me , i roll over and slide open the top drawer of my night table . [SEP]
[CLS] there , hidden among a ju ##mble of makeup and jewelry , is a tiny device disguised to look like a tube of lipstick . [SEP]
[CLS] its actual purpose is a whole lot more in line with what i need right now . [SEP]
[CLS] i press a hidden button on the little bullet and smile as it w ##hir ##s to life . [SEP]
[CLS] my reliable vi ##bra ##tor - the best battery - operated boyfriend around . [SEP]
[CLS] laying back , i bring the vi ##bra ##tor down between my legs , slipping it beneath the lace panties that emerson held in his hands not hours ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the mere thought of his broad , capable hands is enough to get me off almost at once . [SEP]
[CLS] swallowing a low moan , i come into that black lace g - string , with emerson ' s face suspended in my mind ' s eye all the while . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hopefully that wo n ' t make breakfast too awkward , ' ' i whisper to myself , sa ##vor ##ing the relaxing wave that wash ##es over me as i drift into a deep , satisfied sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] the silence that first fell between emerson and i after he saved me from breaking my neck persist ##s for the better part of the next two weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] my handsome house ##mate may as well be a ghost , for all i see of him . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaves for school early in the morning , stays out late at night , and generally avoids me like the plague . [SEP]
[CLS] did i totally wig him out that night at the party ? [SEP]
[CLS] i could have sworn that he was sending me some flirt ##ati ##ous signals , but maybe i totally mis ##rea ##d him . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe he just thinks i ' m an inc ##est - loving freak show now . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been the best flirt , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] riley almost dies when i give her all the juicy details a few days after the party . [SEP]
[CLS] turns out she let us get separated when the cops showed up , so that emerson and i could have an ` ` adventure ' ' all on our own . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , he basically took off your panties and finger - banged you , ' ' she sums it up as we head off on a coffee run during our school lunch hour . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is a very liberal translation , ' ' i say , blushing like crazy as i stare out the passenger side window . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he is so into you , ' ' riley grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe it , after all this time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she catches my frown and back ##tra ##cks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , i can totally believe why he ' d be into you , it ' s just - ' ' ` ` i know that ' s he a bit above my pay grade , ri , ' ' i tell her , leaning back against my seat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not exactly up to par with the girls he usually hangs out with . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without pre ##am ##ble , riley sw ##er ##ves violently onto the shoulder of the main road , causing me to ye ##lp in ab ##ject terror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` listen to me , ' ' she says firmly , taking my face in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are every bit as sexy and bitch ##in ' as emerson sawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d be lucky to have you , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to do that , ' ' i insist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s the bad ##ass , gorgeous lacrosse star , i ' m the weird , short , arts ##y girl . [SEP]
[CLS] if this were a teen movie , maybe we ' d stand a chance . [SEP]
[CLS] but i know my place on the food chain . [SEP]
[CLS] guys like emerson do n ' t go for girls like me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh please , ' ' riley moans , rolling her eyes , ` ` in a few months ' time , we ' re all go ##n na be out in the real world . [SEP]
[CLS] you could take your high - waist ##ed shorts and dark lipstick - wearing self to any major city and be an ' it girl ' in three second flat . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of these asshole ##s will have already peaked in high school , so count your blessings that you ' re a weird ##o now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , ` ` really , ri . [SEP]
[CLS] you always know how to cheer me up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` damn straight i do , ' ' she says , tossing her black curls over her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what best friends are for - ass ##uring you that bon ##ing your maybe - someday - step ##bro ##ther is totally chill as long as your dad does n ' t put a ring on it first . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shake my head as riley laughs , pulling back onto the road with the radio blasting . [SEP]
[CLS] i try my best to keep riley ' s words of encouragement close to my heart as the silence between me and emerson continues on . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d think we were locked in a nuclear arms race , for how cold things have become between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i catch glimpse ##s of him at school , and have the unfortunate experience of watching courtney try to stick her tongue down his throat on more than one occasion . [SEP]
[CLS] but as the days until my eighteenth birthday tick away , the silent treatment goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] a few days before my grand entrance into adulthood , i arrive home from school irritated and di ##sg ##run ##tled . [SEP]
[CLS] the stress of college applications and ap course work coupled with the ongoing radio silence between me and emerson has me way on edge . [SEP]
[CLS] so the very last thing i want to see when i walk in front door of my home is dad and deborah , making out like a couple of teenagers against the kitchen island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jesus , ' ' i mutter , starting for my room , ` ` is everybody getting some action around here besides me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] abby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] deborah giggles from the kitchen , ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi dad . [SEP]
[CLS] hi de ##b , ' ' i mutter gloom ##ily , standing at the foot of the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just go ##n na head up to my room and get some studying in - ' ' ` ` no ##oo , come on . [SEP]
[CLS] come chat with us first ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b insists , bust ##ling out into the foyer to app ##re ##hend me . [SEP]
[CLS] though emerson and i are the same age , deborah is about ten years my dad ' s junior . [SEP]
[CLS] truth be told , she looks even younger than her biological age . [SEP]
[CLS] her vol ##umi ##nous platinum blonde hair is always arranged in lu ##sc ##ious curls , her makeup applied perfectly . [SEP]
[CLS] this stands to reason , given that she works as a freelance makeup artist , mostly doing weddings and the like . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s way taller than i am , especially given her pen ##chan ##t for wearing three - inch heels . [SEP]
[CLS] and , i have to admit , the lady ' s got a killer rack . [SEP]
[CLS] between the tits and her habit of wearing loud neon colors , it ' s no wonder that my dad took notice of her . [SEP]
[CLS] my question is , what does she see in him ? [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t say that my father is una ##tt ##ractive . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just very . . . un ##rem ##ark ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] he was quite the look ##er as a younger man , but my mom sandy was the real beauty . [SEP]
[CLS] their wedding pictures look like something out of a movie . [SEP]
[CLS] i inherited my mom ' s facial features , but missed out on her vibrant red hair and hour ##glass curves . [SEP]
[CLS] ca n ' t pick and choose what you inherit from your parents , i guess . [SEP]
[CLS] and you certainly do n ' t get to choose who your parents are in the first place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s been ages since we ' ve had a good talk , ' ' de ##b gus ##hes , pl ##unk ##ing me down at the kitchen table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me everything . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s school ? [SEP]
[CLS] any boyfriend ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] spill , girl ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance over at my father , silently begging him not to make me engage in small talk with his girlfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] but he just grins at the two of us like we ' re some big , happy family . [SEP]
[CLS] as gr ##ating as de ##b can be , i have n ' t seen my dad smile like this in years . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the least i can do to muscle through some mind ##less chatter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' i begin , ` ` i dunn ##o . . . ' ' the sound of the front door opening is my saving grace . [SEP]
[CLS] i look over my shoulder and see emerson stride across the threshold , making a bee ##line for his room . [SEP]
[CLS] but deborah has other plans , and rushes out to greet him with a sq ##ue ##al . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not so fast ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cries , seizing her son by the arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not every day that i can manage to s ##na ##g you and abby for a chat . [SEP]
[CLS] come on ! [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re having family time ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you high or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson gr ##umble ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i can tell by his in ##fle ##ction that it ' s an honest question . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder what it must have been like for him , growing up with a single mom who had substance abuse issues . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad ' s drinking did n ' t get bad until mom passed away , and by then i was already fourteen . [SEP]
[CLS] but from what i understand , de ##b ' s drinking has been going on for most of emerson ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart twists painfully just thinking about what a rough go he must have had . [SEP]
[CLS] no wonder he ' s got more defense strategies than the pentagon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is so wonderful , ' ' de ##b goes on , forcing emerson into a chair across the table from me . [SEP]
[CLS] we immediately ave ##rt our eyes , looking anywhere but at each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the uncomfortable silence between us is deafening in this enclosed space . [SEP]
[CLS] what i would n ' t give for a trap door or an e ##ject ##ion seat right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` while we ' ve got you both here , ' ' my dad finally cuts in , wrapping an arm around de ##b ' s waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we should talk about your birthday ##s this weekend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` birthday ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , his brow fur ##row ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as in plural ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i add , looking up at my dad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure ! [SEP]
[CLS] have n ' t you guys figured it out yet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dad laughs , ` ` your birthday ##s are only one day apart ! [SEP]
[CLS] abby ' s is may 4th , and emerson ' s is may 3rd . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a satisfied grin spreads across emerson ' s face as he leans back in his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time since that night at the party , he swings his gaze directly my way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look at that , ' ' he says , keeping those blue eyes locked on mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am your big brother after all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , that ' s so precious ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b sw ##oons . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so glad you two are feeling more like family . [SEP]
[CLS] that makes me so , so happy . [SEP]
[CLS] what should we do to celebrate your eighteenth birthday ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] bowling ? [SEP]
[CLS] the movies ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was go ##n na buy a shit load of porn , cigarettes , and scratch off lottery tickets and have myself a private party , ' ' emerson says blunt ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you all are more than welcome to join in . [SEP]
[CLS] though things might get a little . . . awkward . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tear my eyes away from his at this last bit , feeling my cheeks burning hot ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s bait ##ing me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can tell . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly , emerson , ' ' de ##b says , her cheerful ve ##neer cracking , ` ` do you have to shit all over every nice thing i try to do for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry , de ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] he was just kidding , ' ' my dad co ##os , planting a kiss on his girlfriend ' s forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` were n ' t you , emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever helps you sleep at night , sport , ' ' emerson replies shortly , slapping his palms against the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now , as fun as this has been , i ' ve got things to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stroll ##s out of the kitchen , pausing for half a second to snatch a bag of chips out of the cupboard . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b is so pissed off at his behavior that she and my dad do n ' t even try to stop me as i hurry off after emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' i call to him , taking the stairs two at a time to catch up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , wait . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what . [SEP]
[CLS] did i steal your afternoon snack ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins over his shoulder , holding the chips up over my head . [SEP]
[CLS] his favorite game . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you can grab ' em you can have ' em ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not interested in your chips , ' ' i say , standing before him on the landing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just wanted to know if we ' re on speaking terms again now or what . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean , sis ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , ripping open the bag and popping a chip into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] this boy can even making chewing sexy . [SEP]
[CLS] goddamn him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean . . . are you done giving me the cold shoulder ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i press him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve been avoiding me since that party the other night . [SEP]
[CLS] when we - ' ' ` ` whoa , whoa , ' ' emerson chuckles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are way paranoid . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t been avoiding you . [SEP]
[CLS] i just have n ' t noticed you . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s been other shit going on . [SEP]
[CLS] and you ' re pretty easy to miss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bullshit , ' ' i snap , taking a step toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you ' ve been going out of your way not to see me ever since that stupid game in the closet . [SEP]
[CLS] something . . . happened between us , and - ' ' ` ` i do n ' t know what you ' re talking about , ' ' he says , the joking laughter fading from his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do know that i do n ' t want to hear another word about it out of you . [SEP]
[CLS] ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t just pretend that nothing happened ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out , exasperated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` keep your voice down , ' ' he growls , glancing down at the kitchen where our parents are still talking in hushed tones . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] not unless we can have a real conversation about this , ' ' i say at full volume , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you owe me that , at least . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are so fucking impossible , ' ' he says , shoving a hand through his chestnut hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . fine . [SEP]
[CLS] you wan na take a drive or something ? [SEP]
[CLS] will that shut you up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] despite the context of his offer , my stomach still does a thrilled some ##rsa ##ult at the idea of being alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' i say , ` ` let ' s hit the road . [SEP]
[CLS] bro . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you know i ' m just using you as an excuse to get out of this house again , ' ' he gr ##umble ##s , dropping the chips onto the floor and storm ##ing off down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i follow right behind him , wondering whether or not he ' s fucking with me . [SEP]
[CLS] at this moment , it does n ' t much matter . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just happy that he ' s speaking to me again at all . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re just pathetic , i be ##rate myself silently . [SEP]
[CLS] be ##rating myself is something i ' m pretty great at - i have a lot practice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you leaving again already ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b cries from the kitchen as we try to make our exit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just got home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes mother , ' ' emerson sighs , in his most over - the - top cord ##ial voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abigail and i are going to take a spin around town . [SEP]
[CLS] take in some fresh air . [SEP]
[CLS] cheer ##io ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] well . [SEP]
[CLS] good . [SEP]
[CLS] you guys are spending some time together , ' ' de ##b says uncertain ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . [SEP]
[CLS] be back . . . sometime ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will do ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , tipping an imaginary hat to our parents . [SEP]
[CLS] i step out the door after him , shaking my head in amused be ##fu ##ddle ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m the weird ##o , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have n ' t you figured it out yet , sis ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , st ##riding over to the beat up chevy parked in the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re both weird ##oes , you and me . [SEP]
[CLS] get in the car . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tr ##und ##le into the front seat , trying not to ga ##wk as i settle in . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been allowed in emerson ' s car before . [SEP]
[CLS] true , he and his mother have only been living with us for a few weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] but still . [SEP]
[CLS] being admitted into this ` ` sacred vessel ' ' of his feels pretty significant . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s all i can do to keep myself from caressing the worn out leather seats , the dusty dashboard , as if this car were a shrine to the boy i ' m crazy for . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . [SEP]
[CLS] what kind of shit do big brothers do with their little sisters ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , rolling down his window and lighting up a smoke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want me to take you to the playground or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] but you could bum me a cigarette , to begin with , ' ' i say lightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t smoke , ' ' emerson sc ##offs , looking over at me sharply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] but i did , ' ' i inform him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no fucking way , ' ' he says , narrowing his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes fucking way , i assure you , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] gi ##m me one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t mind my saying , ' ' he goes on , passing me his pack of camel ##s and a lighter , ` ` smoking does n ' t really seem like your kind of thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are lots of things you do n ' t know about me , emerson , ' ' i reply , pl ##uck ##ing out a cigarette and lighting it up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but if you ' re real nice to me , i might just tell you a couple . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stares at me for a long , silent moment . [SEP]
[CLS] the same look he trained on me the night of the party - in the closet when i handed him my panties , when he caught me in his arms after i fell - is there in his eyes again now . [SEP]
[CLS] i do my best to draw deep breaths , hoping he ca n ' t read my thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] my desires . [SEP]
[CLS] but instead of giving me any sort of clue as to what he ' s thinking , he just starts the car and drives off toward town . [SEP]
[CLS] we zoom along in silence , unsure of what to say . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , i ' m unsure . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe he just does n ' t care to spare any words on me . [SEP]
[CLS] after a while , he flip ##s on the car radio . [SEP]
[CLS] a song by the foo fighters comes on , and i sit up a little in my seat . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re one of my favorite bands - just heavy enough for my taste . [SEP]
[CLS] i start singing along , nodding my head with the beat . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lets out a short , surprised laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would have taken you for more of a taylor swift kind of girl , ' ' he says over the music . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' m not supposed to make assumptions about you anymore , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i at least assume that you ' ll want dinner at some point tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to fight hard from letting a do ##pe ##y , love - struck look escape across my features . [SEP]
[CLS] he just wants to grab food . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not a date . [SEP]
[CLS] i just happen to be along for the ride . [SEP]
[CLS] but still . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , i ' m starving , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great . [SEP]
[CLS] me too . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s swing by the crystal dawn , ' ' he says , turning off onto a main road in town . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter three the crystal dawn is our local diner , frequented by just about everyone in our relatively small town . [SEP]
[CLS] high school kids , senior citizens , working class parents - no one can resist the crystal ' s dawn ' s greasy spoon appeal . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson rolls up to the silver diner and swings into a parking space , cutting off another car with a laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you just go out of your way to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze people ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , stepping onto the sidewalk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t mean to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze them . [SEP]
[CLS] most people just happen to be asshole ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i just treat them the way they deserve . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugs , tossing his smoke into the gut ##ter . [SEP]
[CLS] i follow suit , re ##lish ##ing my final drag . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been over a year since i ' ve had a cigarette . [SEP]
[CLS] damn , do i miss them sometimes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a charming attitude , ' ' i say , rolling my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks sis , ' ' emerson wink ##s , holding the door open for me like a real gentleman . [SEP]
[CLS] or so i think , until he lets it fall in my face at the last possible second . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe all this love ##y - dove ##y nonsense is just in my head after all . [SEP]
[CLS] we walk across the crowded dining car , over to a red vinyl booth in the back corner . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the regular waitress ##es , a woman in her fort ##ies with heavy blue eye shadow and a per ##m , pl ##unk ##s a couple of menu ##s down onto the table . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t even have to look at them , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve both lived in this town long enough to know exactly what we want . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s said that you can tell a lot about a person by their usual crystal dawn order . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' re you having ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask emerson with a playfully grave tone . [SEP]
[CLS] he wig ##gles his eyebrows con ##sp ##ira ##tori ##ally , perfectly aware of the weight of the question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bacon burger . [SEP]
[CLS] medium rare . [SEP]
[CLS] chip ##ot ##le mayo . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you ' re a raging car ##ni ##vor ##e , ' ' i groan , shaking my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , what are you getting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shoots back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bro ##cco ##li and cheese soup in a bread bowl , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , ' ' he replies , laying his hands on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not . . . a vegetarian , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i sure am , ' ' i reply with a chip ##per smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of fucking course , ' ' he gr ##umble ##s , looking down ##right appalled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know factory farming is destroying our planet , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tease him , putting on my best good ##ie - two - shoes voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know that to ##fu is a sin against humanity , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shoots back . [SEP]
[CLS] that one takes me by surprise , drawing a real laugh out of me for once . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to be perfectly honest , i did n ' t start being a vegetarian for the environment ' s sake , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish i was that noble . [SEP]
[CLS] but the real reason is way stupid ##er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] why did you start ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , halfway interested . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s still halfway more than usual , at least . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i was eight , my dad let me watch jurassic park with him , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know that scene where the goat gets eaten by the t - rex , and its leg flies up and sticks to the window ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , obviously , ' ' emerson replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit was gr ##oa ##dy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s what did it , ' ' i admit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have n ' t eaten meat since watching that movie . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom was so pissed at my dad for turning me off chicken nu ##gg ##ets , i do n ' t think she spoke to him for days . [SEP]
[CLS] they kept waiting for me to grow out of it , but i never did . [SEP]
[CLS] and so , here we are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s hilarious , ' ' emerson says , smiling genuinely for perhaps the first time i ' ve known him . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not like his usual , sarcastic grin . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s something warmer , more honest . [SEP]
[CLS] and it just about does me in . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily , the waitress comes back for our orders right at that moment , so i do n ' t end up throwing myself at him right then and there . [SEP]
[CLS] we laps ##e into silence again as we wait for our food to arrive . [SEP]
[CLS] he agreed to talk to me about what ' s been going on between us , since the night of the party . [SEP]
[CLS] but now that the moment has arrived , i ca n ' t think of how to begin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . [SEP]
[CLS] are you and courtney a thing or what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blur ##t out . [SEP]
[CLS] smooth , abby , i gr ##umble internally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` courtney ? [SEP]
[CLS] nah , ' ' emerson shrugs , ` ` a little too high maintenance for me . [SEP]
[CLS] and crazy as shit , too . [SEP]
[CLS] plus she ' s always got show tunes on . . . who listen ##s to show tunes for fun ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure she ' s . . . nice . [SEP]
[CLS] when you get to know her , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thing i want to do is go shit ##ting on other girls just because they happen to have sucked face with emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] if i did that , just about every pretty girl in our school would be on my shit list . [SEP]
[CLS] girl on girl hate is something i try and avoid altogether , if i can help it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not really that interested in ' nice ' , is the thing , ' ' emerson sc ##offs , picking at a bit of loose paint on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what . . . are you interested in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , my voice going soft on me . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lifts his eyes to mine , the gold spec ##ks reflecting in the dying spring light outside the diner window . [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow hard , waiting for him to go on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m interested in someone who can teach me things . [SEP]
[CLS] show me things , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m totally taken aback by his direct answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say meek ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could hang out with hot girls who do n ' t give a damn about me as a person , or look for someone who seems interested in something other than my fantastic body , ' ' he continues , ` ` i ' m go ##n na go with the latter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] of course , he ca n ' t let a serious phrase go by without turning into a joke . [SEP]
[CLS] is that a defense mechanism or what ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you ever met someone like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i dare to ask him , ` ` someone you could be interested in for more than a weekend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he lets me writ ##he under his gaze , taking his sweet time to formula ##te an answer to my question . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my cheeks growing hotter by the second before he finally says one word : ` ` maybe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the restaurant seems to fall away around us as emerson trains his eyes on me . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to choose my response very , very carefully here . [SEP]
[CLS] this one little moment could be a turning point . [SEP]
[CLS] a transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] with my heart in my throat , i let my hand rest on the table , only a couple of inches away from his . [SEP]
[CLS] those mere inches of space spark with electricity , searing my already fray ##ed nerves . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could tell him that i want the same thing from a relationship - to be with someone who challenges me , like he does . [SEP]
[CLS] someone who ' s not interested in being nice or normal , like he is . [SEP]
[CLS] someone who could show me a life i ' d never be able to dream up on my own . [SEP]
[CLS] like he very well could . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , ' ' i say softly , letting my hand drift slowly toward his , ` ` i - ' ' the front door of the diner flies open , slamming against the wall with a loud cl ##atter . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson turns to look over his shoulder at the sound , and just like that , the spell is broken . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up , annoyed , to see who ' s disrupted our near - perfect moment . [SEP]
[CLS] but when i recognize the group that ' s just sa ##unt ##ered inside , i feel myself going numb . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goddamn it , ' ' i whisper , ` ` not now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i quickly hiding my hands under the table , not wanting emerson to see how they ' ve begun to shake . [SEP]
[CLS] i pretend to be very interested in something out the window as i hear the bois ##ter ##ous voices of three guys from my school fill the enclosed space , one of whom i ' m very intimately , and very unfortunately , acquainted with . [SEP]
[CLS] to my horror , i watch from the corner of my eye as emerson waves at the trio . [SEP]
[CLS] of course . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re his lacrosse teammates . [SEP]
[CLS] he has no idea why flag ##ging them down is the worst thing he could possibly do to me right now . [SEP]
[CLS] against my silent prayers to any god that ' s listening , the three boys stroll over to our table . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson swings his body around to greet them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey guys , ' ' he says to his three teammates . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey tank , ' ' says one of the guys , a blonde junior named steve , using emerson ' s lacrosse nickname . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] as usual , ' ' emerson laughs , ` ` what ' s happening tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` some people will be over at my place , ' ' says roger , a lan ##ky senior . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` got a couple of dime bags , if you want in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i do , ' ' emerson replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we interrupting you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] steve asks . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel their three sets of eyes fall on my face like laser beams . [SEP]
[CLS] shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i was hoping i ' d get out of this without having to say a word to them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just grabbing some food , ' ' emerson says , ` ` right abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with great reluctance , i raise my eyes to the four boys before me . [SEP]
[CLS] i try to keep my gaze trained on emerson , or even steve and roger , but my eyes ca n ' t help themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] they flick mas ##och ##istic ##ally up to the third boy standing next to our table . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s as tall as emerson , with jet black hair slick ##ed away from his hard jaw , his full lips . [SEP]
[CLS] his own dark eyes skirt away from mine the second we make eye contact . [SEP]
[CLS] he has n ' t looked at me in years . [SEP]
[CLS] i like to believe it ' s because he ca n ' t bear to , that the guilt and shame are too much for him to deal with . [SEP]
[CLS] but in reality , it ' s probably just cold indifference that rep ##els his gaze from me . [SEP]
[CLS] his name is tucker jacob ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] he very nearly der ##ailed my entire life , back when we were fifteen . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s abundant ##ly clear that emerson has no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . . . ' ' i finally manage to say , my voice barely audible . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just getting some food . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you guys know abby , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says to the trio . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my skin starting to crawl with every passing moment they . . . he linger ##s beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah , ' ' steve nods , ` ` you do all those cartoons in the school newspaper , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' i say shortly , my hands shaking violently under the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i liked the one with the duck , ' ' roger puts in , ` ` did n ' t really get the joke , but - ' ' ` ` i ' m starving , ' ' tucker cuts in . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound of his voice is like an ice pick to my composure . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s get a table . [SEP]
[CLS] see you , tank . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turns away without acknowledging me , just as he ' s done for the past couple of years . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson raises an eyebrow at his retreating back before glancing over at me . [SEP]
[CLS] he freeze ##s as he catches a glimpse of my upset expression , taken off guard by the ex ##tre ##mity of my discomfort . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ya , tank , ' ' roger says , turning toward the table that tucker ' s claimed for them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` think you ' ll swing by my place tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get back to you on that , ' ' emerson says , his eyes still fixed on my troubled face . [SEP]
[CLS] the sudden concern cloud ##ing his handsome face is enough to make my own eyes prick ##le with hot tears . [SEP]
[CLS] roger and steve tr ##und ##le away after tucker , leaving emerson and i alone again at last . [SEP]
[CLS] our food has yet to arrive , but i ' ve lost any trace of my appetite . [SEP]
[CLS] the air in the crystal dawn feels poisonous now . [SEP]
[CLS] contaminated . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m finding it harder to breathe with every shallow gulp of air i can manage to force down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , are you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , reaching for me across the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . i need . . . ' ' i gasp , struggling to form the simplest words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can we go ? [SEP]
[CLS] please ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course we can , ' ' emerson says , his voice soft but firm . [SEP]
[CLS] he rises to his feet and offers me a hand as i stand , sha ##ki ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the comforting weight of his arm as he dr ##apes it over my shoulders , holding me s ##nu ##gly against his muscled side . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , i ' d be all butterflies and gi ##ddin ##ess to be this close to him . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the midst of my anxiety attack , all i can feel is icy panic . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t help but glance over at tucker as emerson leads me out of the diner . [SEP]
[CLS] i should be used to the un ##car ##ing expression he saves just for me by now . [SEP]
[CLS] i should n ' t let the mere sight of him un ##rave ##l me like this . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' m just not strong enough to not give a shit . [SEP]
[CLS] i never have been . [SEP]
[CLS] after what feels like a decade , i settle into the passenger seat of emerson ' s chevy . [SEP]
[CLS] as he rounds the car , sinks into the driver ' s seat , and slams the door shut behind him , the bubble of my fear and apprehension bursts . [SEP]
[CLS] shame and relief crash simultaneously over me , rendering me speechless as emerson turns to take me in . [SEP]
[CLS] his look , infused with compassion , undo ##es me completely . [SEP]
[CLS] fat tears roll down my cheeks as i stare straight ahead , wishing that i could actually be as small as tucker makes me feel . [SEP]
[CLS] if i was , it would be easy enough to slip through the cracks and disappear forever . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' emerson says quietly , ` ` can you tell me what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i draw in a deep , ragged breath , trying to muster the strength for words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' i finally manage to whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t need to apologize for anything , ' ' he says , his brow fur ##row ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , is it ok if i hold your hand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his simple request acts as a life preserve ##r , saving me from going under in this rush of emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] i look over at him and nod silently . [SEP]
[CLS] without pause , emerson reaches for the hand that is currently gripping my thigh , un ##cu ##rl ##s my fingers , and lace ##s them with his own . [SEP]
[CLS] i cl ##ing onto him like a drowning woman , amazed that he took the time to ask me if i wanted to be touched . [SEP]
[CLS] i remember , through my thick fog of misery , that he must have plenty of practice being the comfort ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] how many times has he sat with de ##b as she descended into a de ##pressive stu ##por ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' i manage to tell him through my tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any time , ' ' he replies , giving my hand a squeeze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you with me now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m here , ' ' i gasp . [SEP]
[CLS] his simple touch was enough to drag me through the thick of my panic . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel the world coming back into focus around me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you want to talk about what just happened back there , ' ' emerson says , rubbing his thumb against my still - trembling hand , ` ` we can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i look over at him , leaning toward me from the passenger seat . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never seen him like this before . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s calm . [SEP]
[CLS] gentle . [SEP]
[CLS] caring . [SEP]
[CLS] and all for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i desperately want to explain myself , to tell him why i had to get out of that diner the second tucker walked in . [SEP]
[CLS] but letting him in on my shame ##ful secret . . . what if it wiped that compassionate look right off his face ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if he was never able to look at me the same way again ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re so close to figuring out how to talk to each other , how to spend time together despite everything . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to ruin that . [SEP]
[CLS] not for anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you mind if we just . . . went home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , forcing my voice to remain steady . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' emerson says , ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] we can go home , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he holds my gaze for a long moment before turning back to the wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] delicately , he ex ##tric ##ates his fingers from mine to start the car . [SEP]
[CLS] but the second we ' re in motion , i reach for it again . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand is my anchor in this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i need it . [SEP]
[CLS] i need him . [SEP]
[CLS] we ride home in utter silence . [SEP]
[CLS] the radio stays off , the windows stay closed . [SEP]
[CLS] i gaze out the window at the darkening landscape , the familiar con ##tour ##s of the town i ' ve called home all my life . [SEP]
[CLS] the incident at the diner only makes me want to speed up the days until i finally get to leave this place behind , go somewhere where nobody knows me at all . [SEP]
[CLS] but how can i wish these days away knowing that my flight from here will mean being separated from emerson ? [SEP]
[CLS] anger floods in to replace my fear and shame . [SEP]
[CLS] tucker has already taken so much from me . [SEP]
[CLS] caused me so much pain . [SEP]
[CLS] now my long - awaited conversation with emerson about where we stand has been ruined , thanks to him . [SEP]
[CLS] if he proves to be the thing that keeps emerson and i from every truly getting a chance at being close , i ' ll never forgive him . [SEP]
[CLS] then again , i never plan on for ##giving him anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] there are some things that no amount of time or patience can men ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that from experience . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter four despite emerson ' s offer to listen if i want to talk about the ` ` diner incident ' ' , we do n ' t get into it upon arriving home . [SEP]
[CLS] dad and deborah have gone out for dinner , as they do most nights when emerson and i are n ' t around . [SEP]
[CLS] the house feels cavern ##ous and cold tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] this place has n ' t felt like home since mom passed away , but after what just happened with tucker , the entire town feels un ##in ##hab ##ita ##ble to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like i ' m fifteen years old again . [SEP]
[CLS] scared , confused , and so , so lonely . [SEP]
[CLS] only now , there ' s actually someone here to help me through it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we still need to rust ##le up some gr ##ub , ' ' emerson says , moving ahead of me into the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t seem to mind my radio silence about what just went down at the restaurant , but there ' s definitely been a shift in his demeanor . [SEP]
[CLS] his usual grin has been replaced by a comforting smile , and his entire attitude toward me seems gentle ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] nice ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t that he ' s pity ##ing me , thank god . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s almost as if he ' s recognized something of himself in me . [SEP]
[CLS] go figure - i ' m sure he has more pain hidden inside of him than anyone should be made to live with . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m a terrible cook , ' ' i tell him , leaning my elbows on the kitchen island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could n ' t even boil water if i tried . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` huh . [SEP]
[CLS] lucky for you , i happen to be an excellent chef , ' ' emerson says seriously , opening up the kitchen cupboard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait . [SEP]
[CLS] really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , ' ' he replies , ` ` i had to cook for mom most of the time growing up . [SEP]
[CLS] letting a wasted person near sharp knives and open flames is a terrible idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that follows , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what do you have in mind , master chef ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' he says , pl ##uck ##ing a few items down off the cupboard shelf . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how do you feel about ri ##so ##tto ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you kidding ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i blur ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s one of my all - time favorite foods . [SEP]
[CLS] i used to ask my mom to make it every year for my birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] but there ' s no way he could have known that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll take that as a ' fuck yeah ' , ' ' emerson smiles , pl ##unk ##ing a container of arbor ##io rice down onto the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you find us a movie on demand to watch or something ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get this thing whipped up in no time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i follow his suggestion and head for the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] stealing a glance at emerson over my shoulder , i feel my heart warm up a few degrees . [SEP]
[CLS] his face is composed , free from the scowl that usually rests there . [SEP]
[CLS] with dad and de ##b out for the night , i can almost imagine that this is our place - mine and emerson ' s alone . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve never once spent time like this together . [SEP]
[CLS] he hardly ever stays in for a night , and i ' m mostly preoccupied with extra ##cu ##rricular ##s and long study sessions at the library . [SEP]
[CLS] after our disastrous outing before , this evening is suddenly looking up . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe we ' ll even get around to discussing this sudden shift in our relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s cooking me dinner , after all . [SEP]
[CLS] clearly , miracles do happen . [SEP]
[CLS] i scroll through dozens upon dozens of movies as emerson cooks . [SEP]
[CLS] the sa ##vor ##y fragrance of his recipe makes my stomach growl in eager anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] was that you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he calls from the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not very lady ##like , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want from me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grin back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your go ##ur ##met masterpiece is taking forever . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m starving in here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could always just scrap it and make you some easy mac instead , ' ' he tease ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not that inhuman ##e , ' ' i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is true , ' ' he chuckles , filling two bowls with the steam ##y , decade ##nt meal he ' s prepared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , this looks too good to waste . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson walks over to the deep sectional couch where i ' ve made myself a nest of pillows and blankets . [SEP]
[CLS] i let out a low moan as i smell the garlic ##ky , mushroom ##y goodness of the food . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson hands me a heap ##ing bowl topped with a mound of par ##mes ##an cheese and pl ##ops down onto the couch beside me , kicking his feet up onto the coffee table . [SEP]
[CLS] almost rev ##ere ##ntly , i scoop a bite of ri ##so ##tto onto my gigantic silver spoon and raise it to my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson watches expect ##antly out of the corner of his eye as i sample his cooking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , ' ' i mum ##ble around a mouthful of rice , ` ` i think i just came . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lets out a bark of surprised laughter at my cr ##ass joke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you like it then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nod eagerly , burr ##owing into the couch while i take bite after delicious bite of the food he ' s prepared . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs to me , as i nos ##h , that i have n ' t had an honest - to - god home cooked meal since my mom died . [SEP]
[CLS] that awareness only makes this gesture of emerson ' s that much more meaningful to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what ' re we watching ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , taking a bite of ri ##so ##tto for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab the remote and click through to the film of my choice . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s an old favorite of mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ta - da ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say happily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the fuck ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson sc ##offs as he sees what movie i ' ve picked out for us tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you were go ##n na go for something with super heroes . [SEP]
[CLS] or vampires . [SEP]
[CLS] anything but this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dr . z ##hi ##va ##go is a classic ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` classical ##ly de ##pressing , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you ever even seen it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i press . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] no , ' ' he admits , ` ` but look at all that snow and shit on the poster ! [SEP]
[CLS] unless we ' re talking about snow dogs , that ' s never a sign of a cheerful movie . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cheerful is over ##rated , ' ' i tell him , ` ` and this movie is fantastic . [SEP]
[CLS] just give it a chance . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise , you ' ll love it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raises an eyebrow at my fe ##r ##vid vow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . . . ' ' i amend , ` ` i promise you wo n ' t absolutely des ##pis ##e it , anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if it were any other day , i ' m sure emerson would never submit to watching an old , tragic ##ally romantic movie with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can practically see him swallowing his pride like a big old bite of mushroom ri ##so ##tto as he says , ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] put it on . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll try not to fall asleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with a glee ##ful squeak , i queue up the film and settle back against the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] as the opening theme swell ##s to fill our living room , emerson ease ##s over on the couch so that our bodies are almost , almost touching . [SEP]
[CLS] his closeness , his kindness , and his understanding very nearly erase the upset ##ting events of this afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i let myself get swept up in the film , in his company , in the wonderful , unprecedented feeling of comfort that ' s wrapped around me like so many blankets . [SEP]
[CLS] as we fill our bell ##ies and turn our attention toward the movie , i ' m amazed at how normal this all feels . [SEP]
[CLS] spending time with emerson feels natural . [SEP]
[CLS] easy . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe there was a little silver lining to being so vulnerable in front of him earlier today , scary as it was . [SEP]
[CLS] of their own accord , our bodies drift closer together over the course of the long film . [SEP]
[CLS] the big meal has made me happy and sleepy , and i can feel my eyelids growing heavy . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s long , built body relax ##es next to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] and as we both lose ourselves in epic story , he casually en ##ci ##rcle ##s me with a strong , muscular arm . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m el ##ated to be close to him , but more surprised at how effortlessly our bodies fit together . [SEP]
[CLS] i s ##nu ##ggle against his side , resting my head on his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] the warmth of his body is like a bal ##m to my fray ##ed nerves , and we stay co ##zie ##d up for the duration of the film . [SEP]
[CLS] at long last , when the final credits roll , i ' m reluctant to reach for the remote , to let reality come sweeping into this perfect , suspended moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i can sense hesitation in him too , but that could just be a lot of wish ##ful thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] at long last , the screen goes black . [SEP]
[CLS] the house is almost entirely dark without the blue glow of the tv . [SEP]
[CLS] but even so , neither of us makes the first move to di ##sen ##tangle our bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] if there was any question before , i know that this embrace is more than merely plato ##nic . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s hand moves slowly along my side , sending sensation spark ##ing along each nerve he brushes . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn my face gently toward his , peering up in the dim light . [SEP]
[CLS] his blue eyes gleam even in the darkness , and his caring expression gives me the courage to rest a hand on the firm pan ##es of his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep , steady ##ing breath , willing myself to be strong . [SEP]
[CLS] steady . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for this , ' ' i say , un ##sur ##pr ##ised to find that my voice has slipped low in my register with wanting him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you were out to make me feel better after this afternoon , and . . . well . [SEP]
[CLS] it worked . [SEP]
[CLS] this was exactly what i needed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad , ' ' he says , tugging me just a hair tighter against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hated seeing you so upset back at the restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] i figured dinner and a movie was the least i could do . [SEP]
[CLS] was that a panic attack , or - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anxiety attack , yeah , ' ' i reply , sc ##oot ##ing up so that our faces are level . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been having them for a few years now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did they start when your mom passed away ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . [SEP]
[CLS] no , ' ' i say , ave ##rting my eyes , ` ` not exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to tell me anything you do n ' t want to , ' ' emerson insists . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i do want to . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you to know what today was about , i just . . . ' ' i sigh , trying to find the right words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hardly anyone knows . [SEP]
[CLS] and this whole us - getting - along thing is pretty new , you know ? [SEP]
[CLS] i just need to know . . . that i can trust you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow a gasp as emerson lays a hand on my cheek , his eyes burning intently into mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can trust me , ' ' he says , ` ` i promise you that much , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] how can i prove it to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trade me a secret for a secret ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , only half joking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' he replies , his gaze un ##wave ##ring , ` ` deal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , sitting up a little straight ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously , ' ' he says , letting his fingertips trail over my shoulder , down my arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to know i ' m for real . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll tell you a secret if you ' ll let me in on one of yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i try my best to take deep breaths , suddenly afraid of knowing emerson ' s secrets , being bound to share mine as well . [SEP]
[CLS] but i know i have to be bold , now . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve spent too much time living in shame and fear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i whisper , inch ##ing closer toward him , ` ` tell me a secret , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] make it a good one , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right , ' ' he says , his voice hoarse and low , ` ` i have n ' t stopped thinking about you for two weeks straight . [SEP]
[CLS] since the night of the party . [SEP]
[CLS] i got to see a side of you that night i ' d never seen before . [SEP]
[CLS] in the closet , during that stupid game . . . you were so direct . [SEP]
[CLS] so ready . [SEP]
[CLS] and so fucking sexy . [SEP]
[CLS] if the cops had n ' t shown up , i do n ' t know what would have happened . [SEP]
[CLS] but i damn well know what i wanted to happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , so close to him that i can feel his warm breath against my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you want to happen ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes glint with something that looks like longing . [SEP]
[CLS] lust . [SEP]
[CLS] can this seriously be happening right now ? [SEP]
[CLS] is someone about to leap out from behind a house ##pl ##ant and tell me i ' ve been punk ' d or what ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it would probably be better for me to show you than tell you , ' ' he growls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] unable to formula ##te a single word , i simply nod my assent . [SEP]
[CLS] with a fiery intensity i ' ve never seen in him before , emerson catches my face in his broad hands . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my heart barrel ##ing against my rib ##ca ##ge as he takes one long , steady look at me . [SEP]
[CLS] before i can take another breath , he ' s brought his lips to mine in a searing , earnest kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire world shrink ##s down to our two bodies as i feel myself sub ##sume ##d by the sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips are un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly soft , his mouth so strong as it works against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i open myself to him , closing my eyes in rap ##tur ##ous bliss as his tongue glances against my own . [SEP]
[CLS] the taste of him elect ##ri ##fies my senses . [SEP]
[CLS] in this moment , there is nothing but him . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp softly as emerson pulls me onto his lap . [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##rad ##dle him , wrapping my arms around his shoulders as his tongue probe ##s deeper and deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] pressing myself flush against him , i let a low groan escape from between my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel through his signature blue jeans that he ' s hard for me . [SEP]
[CLS] the full , stiff ##ening length of him presses against my sex , exactly where i ' ve been dreaming of feeling him for the better part of four years . [SEP]
[CLS] my body has never been this alive with want . [SEP]
[CLS] not with anybody . [SEP]
[CLS] moving with him feels intuitive in a way it never has with any other guy . [SEP]
[CLS] i grind my hips slowly , feeling him grow even harder beneath me . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands slide down over my ass , running along the firm rise in my jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me tighter , letting me feel just how much he wants me . [SEP]
[CLS] in a moment of daring , i close my teeth around his bottom lip , tugging gently . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks up at me in wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where the hell did you come from , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he breathe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been here all along , ' ' i smile , running my hands through his chestnut hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just have n ' t noticed until now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' he chuckles , wrapping his arms around the small of my back , ` ` you honestly think i never noticed you before ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . . . you never said a word to me before our parents met , ' ' i point out , bringing my lips to his sc ##ruff ##y throat and kissing deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would i ? [SEP]
[CLS] you were way out of my league , ' ' he replies , running his down my sides . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t want to risk making an ass of myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i start laughing so hard that i nearly top ##ple off of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now that is hilarious , ' ' i crow , steady ##ing myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me ? [SEP]
[CLS] out of your league ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' he says , ` ` can you seriously not see that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all i can see right now is you , mr . drop dead gorgeous lacrosse star , ' ' i smile , feeling em ##bold ##ened by his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and since we ' re being honest , here . . . i ' ve been carrying quite the torch for you these past four years . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve sort of been crushing on you from afar since . . . oh . . . the minute i saw you in school for the first time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no shit ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no shit , ' ' i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how messed up is it that we only figured this out because our parents started bon ##ing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u ##gh ##h , ' ' i groan , rolling off of him onto the couch , ` ` please do n ' t talk about our parents having sex right now . [SEP]
[CLS] or ever , for that matter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine by me , ' ' he says , shifting his body my way . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , he lays me out on the sofa , lowering his muscled body onto mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he runs his index finger along my jaw , tipping my chin up toward his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to talk right now anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses me again , his hands ro ##ving all over my body . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches as he cups my breasts through my thin cotton tee shirt , letting his thumbs brush over my hard nipples . [SEP]
[CLS] as he kn ##ead ##s and caress ##es me , a low , pulsing pressure starts to build in my core . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t remember the last time i got off without my handy dan ##dy vi ##bra ##tor . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been ages since i ' ve hooked up with anyone , and the intensity of the pleasure emerson is best ##owing on me is almost too much to bear . [SEP]
[CLS] almost . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been dreaming of this for so long , ' ' i sigh , letting my head fall back against the couch cushions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have no idea , emerson . . . ' ' ` ` oh , i think i do , ' ' he chuckles , pressing his hips against me , letting me feel that staggering length . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that the secret you were going to trade me for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` w - what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer , my eyes spring ##ing open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know . [SEP]
[CLS] a secret for a secret . [SEP]
[CLS] like we said , ' ' emerson cl ##ari ##fies , prop ##ping himself up on his forearms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' i say softly , feeling the wonderful peace this evening has brought slipping away as the moment of my big reveal approaches . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . [SEP]
[CLS] no , i - ' ' ` ` shit , ' ' he mutter ##s , brushing a lock of hair away from my face , ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m totally killing the mood , here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t be trusted not to fuck up something as awesome as this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t fucked anything up , ' ' i insist , but it ' s too late . [SEP]
[CLS] i can already see his expression darkening . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to back ##ped ##al , right things before it ' s too late . [SEP]
[CLS] deep dark secrets can wait for a spell . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to show him that we ' re on the same page . [SEP]
[CLS] and like emerson says , better to show than tell . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , i reach for his belt buckle , whipping it open with a metallic clan ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s eyes go wide as i slowly ease down the zipper of his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] i guide him onto his back , climbing on top of him as i work to release his member from his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] his hardness strains against the thick denim , ready to burst through - we both sit bolt upright as the sound of keys in the front door lock ring through the empty house . [SEP]
[CLS] gi ##ddy giggles sound from beyond the door as emerson and i look at each other in ab ##ject horror . [SEP]
[CLS] no more playing house for us . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b and dad are home . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit , ' ' emerson fu ##mes , buck ##ling in his staggering erection and covering his lap with a throw pillow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fucking shit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ll never know , ' ' i assure him , smoothing down my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how would they ever even guess , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll still be right down the hall , you know . [SEP]
[CLS] this is n ' t over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we trade wary smiles as the front door bursts open . [SEP]
[CLS] if i did n ' t know any better , i ' d say that our parents are absolutely trash ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad all but carries de ##b over the threshold , humming some sort of ridiculous - vaguely familiar - marching tune . [SEP]
[CLS] but taking a closer look , it ' s plain to see that they ' re just excited , not drunk at all . [SEP]
[CLS] thank god for that . [SEP]
[CLS] a two - for - one re ##la ##pse is not what we need right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby ! [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b sq ##ue ##als , kicking her high - heel ##ed feet in the air as dad spins her around the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so glad you ' re both here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you seem . . . glad , ' ' emerson says , his brow furrowed as he takes in the sight of our giggling parents . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s , uh . . . what ' s going on with you two ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you win the lottery or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i wage ##r a guess , trying not to think of what would have happened had they come home just a few seconds earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we did win the lottery , in a way , ' ' my dad beams , setting de ##b down at last . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i trade baffled looks , overwhelmed by our parents ' behavior , and the bizarre turn this evening has taken . [SEP]
[CLS] between our mutual confessions and whatever ' s going on with dad and de ##b , i , for one , ca n ' t seem to get my bearings . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you tell them the good news , baby , ' ' my dad urges de ##b , wrapping an arm around her slender waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok honey bear , ' ' she sq ##ue ##als , bouncing on the balls of her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] bob and i . . . well . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s just say we finally figured out what to get you guys for your birthday ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what ' s . . . that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks cautiously . [SEP]
[CLS] in answer , de ##b simply holds her left hand up for us to take a gan ##der at . [SEP]
[CLS] for a split second , i ' m totally at a loss . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , before i catch the spark ##ly g ##lim ##mer shining off her ring finger . [SEP]
[CLS] there on her hand is a rock the size of rhode island . [SEP]
[CLS] an engagement ring , by the looks of it . [SEP]
[CLS] the implications of her new accessory wall ##op me as i sit beside emerson , staring in horrified silence . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b ' s wearing an engagement ring . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re going to get you each a brand new sibling ! [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll be one big , happy family at last ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cries ec ##static ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the fuck are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , spring ##ing to his feet . [SEP]
[CLS] safe to say any lingering evidence of our bliss ##ful excitement is long gone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bob and i are going to get married , sweetie ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b goes on , her smile wave ##ring . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we did n ' t want to ups ##tage your eighteenth birthday ##s , though , so we ' re going to wait until the weekend after . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how thoughtful of you , ' ' emerson snarl ##s , his face turning bright red . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remind me to make sure and nominate you for mother of the year . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop it , ' ' de ##b says , her eyes filling with angry tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t get to ruin this moment for me . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to be happy for me , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] for once in your goddamn life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t really see that happening , ' ' emerson sc ##offs , his walls and defenses spring ##ing back into place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least tell your mother that you ' re happy for her , emerson , ' ' my dad says harshly . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes go wide at his tone . [SEP]
[CLS] he never rep ##rim ##ands emerson for anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` already playing at being my old man , bob ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , with a cold smile that does n ' t reach his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hate to break it to you , but that ship sailed a long time ago . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks for at least waiting until i ' m a legal adult to pull this crap . [SEP]
[CLS] that way i can bail on this shit show with no strings attached . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , please , ' ' de ##b says plain ##tively , but it ' s no use . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s already turned his back and marched out the door once again . [SEP]
[CLS] we hear his chevy start up and peel out of driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] i blink back devastated tears , looking longing ##ly after him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could have at least taken me with him . [SEP]
[CLS] after everything we shared this evening , everything we did . . . he said i could trust him . [SEP]
[CLS] was that just another lie to get in my pants ? [SEP]
[CLS] no . [SEP]
[CLS] of course not . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just hurt by our parents ' careless ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] hurt by what it means for us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to say congratulations at least ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad asks me flatly , placing a comforting hand on de ##b ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . i do n ' t . . . ' ' i st ##am ##mer , looking back and forth between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know what you want from me , dad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that . . . is very disappointing , ' ' he replies , looking as hurt as i ' ve ever seen him . [SEP]
[CLS] but how the hell am i supposed to cong ##rat ##ulate them on what is clearly nothing more than an imp ##ulsive , terrible decision ? [SEP]
[CLS] they barely even know each other . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re still in the early stages of recovery . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell are they thinking ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so un ##grate ##ful , both of them , ' ' de ##b mutter ##s , marching up the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] dad he ##aves a sigh as she slams their bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] an eerie silence falls over the house , pun ##ctuated only by de ##b ' s muffled sobs from upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad and i look at each other across the wide open space . [SEP]
[CLS] this is as alone as we ' ve been in months , ever since de ##b showed up on the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish i could be honest with him right now , tell him how reckless he ' s being , tell him how much it hurts me to see him pick up with the first woman he meets without actually giving a shit about her . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' ve never been able to call my dad out on his bad behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is not how i saw tonight ending , ' ' he mutter ##s , shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just wish you would have asked us if we were ok with this , ' ' i say , frustrated tears stinging my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , ' ' my dad replies , ` ` since when do parents ask their children for permission ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just . . . you hardly know her ! [SEP]
[CLS] she hardly knows you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it you even love about her , dad ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , you do love her - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i do , ' ' he says gruff ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love how she looks . [SEP]
[CLS] how she carries herself . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] her hair . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , sc ##off ##ing , ` ` you like the way she looks ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you and emerson will be adults soon , ' ' my dad says firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` before long , you ' ll know what it feels like to want something - someone - so badly that you ' re willing to do just about anything to be together . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope you ' ll have the courage to make that leap when the time comes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i almost laugh as he sp ##ew ##s these ##s words of wisdom . [SEP]
[CLS] he practically just told me to go ahead and jump my soon - to - be - step ##bro ##ther ' s bones . [SEP]
[CLS] but as absurd as this all is , i ca n ' t laugh at about it just yet . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain is far too raw . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a good chance it always will be . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter five it ' s three in the morning before i hear emerson ' s car swing back into the driveway beneath my window . [SEP]
[CLS] in the four hours or so he ' s been on the road blowing off steam , i have n ' t slept a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] have n ' t even come close . [SEP]
[CLS] my nerves have been on a hair - trigger , ready to snap clean in two , as i wait for him to return . [SEP]
[CLS] the second i hear his car door slam , i throw off my covers and roll out of bed . [SEP]
[CLS] crossing my arms over my chest and throwing my blonde hair into a messy ponytail , i pad over to my bedroom window and ease it open . [SEP]
[CLS] leaning out into the warm spring air , i see emerson leaning heavily against the hood of his car , looking up at our house with despair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , emerson , ' ' i whisper , waving to get his attention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he murmurs back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , ` ` i was waiting for you . [SEP]
[CLS] stay there - i ' m coming down . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to , ' ' he starts to say , but i ' ve already turned away from the window . [SEP]
[CLS] i take the stairs two at a time , not pausing long enough to be self - conscious about my tiny cotton shorts and cam ##iso ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] i gently push open the front door and step out into the darkness of the very early morning . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson watches as i cross the driveway toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles wryly at my approach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you trying to kill me with those shorts or what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says . [SEP]
[CLS] though i know he ' s teasing , there ' s a frustrated , regret ##ful hunger beneath his words that breaks my heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` some of us have been in bed for hours now , ' ' i remind him , leaning against the car by his side , ` ` instead of ren ##ding our shirts and bell ##owing into the wind . [SEP]
[CLS] or whatever it was you were doing out there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that about sums it up , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what , are you pissed at me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it would have been nice to not be stuck alone with our parents after all that , ' ' i point out , ` ` your mom cried for hours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s one of her favorite ho ##bbies , ' ' emerson shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could have at least taken me with you , ' ' i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` after everything . . . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' he says , a small sigh escaping his lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not used to looking out for anyone besides myself , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i gave up on my mom years ago , and i guess when shit gets real i just look out for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok , ' ' i whisper , reaching for his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] to my relief , he lets me take it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re back now . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s what matters . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looks my way , his blue eyes gleaming even in the darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see a million thoughts swirling behind those eyes , afl ##oat in a churning sea of turmoil and rage . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish there was anything i could do to ease that pain . [SEP]
[CLS] and maybe , just maybe , there is . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' i say , tugging his hand , ` ` let ' s go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go where ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , standing stock still . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m exhausted , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just follow me , sawyer , ' ' i reply , pretending impatience . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` unless you ' re too chicken shit , that is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rolls his eyes with just enough playful ##ness to give me hope . [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , i tow him away from the car . [SEP]
[CLS] silently , we make our way around the perimeter of the house , the expansive back yard , the black water of the in - ground pool . [SEP]
[CLS] i lead emerson along the edge of the woods that surround our property , peeling off down a well - worn dirt path . [SEP]
[CLS] i expect his body to tense up as i drag him into the foliage , but he follows game ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose he does n ' t scare so easy , emerson sawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here it is , ' ' i say , after a few minutes of tr ##ud ##ging along through the under ##brush . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve come to a stop before a thick , sturdy trunk , in ##laid with wooden plank ##s that serve as foot ##hold ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a place i ' ve come to love and depend on as a safe haven . [SEP]
[CLS] during the worst of mom and dad ' s fights , and later the worst of his drunken rage ##s , this is where i ' d come . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is ' it ' ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , raising an eyebrow at the makeshift ladder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll show you , ' ' i tell him , grasping a plank and pulling myself up a foot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just do n ' t check out my ass the whole time i ' m climbing , now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that . . . is not a fair request , ' ' he smiles , as i sc ##ur ##ry up the trunk before him . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his eyes ra ##king along my body the whole while . [SEP]
[CLS] and despite my instructions , i ca n ' t pretend that i mind too much . [SEP]
[CLS] as we hit the point where the tree ' s branches begin to fan out , i pull myself onto a wide wooden platform , sc ##oot ##ing over to make room for emerson beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] this weathered deck was built to last , but it helps that i ' ve maintained it over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not quite a tree ##house , but it does the trick as far as secret hide ##away ##s go . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , this is rustic , ' ' emerson laughs , swinging himself up onto the platform to join me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did your dad make this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my grandpa did , actually , ' ' i tell him , ` ` back when my dad was still a kid . [SEP]
[CLS] this was his and my grandma ' s house , before they passed it along to my mom and dad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did they . . . pass away ? [SEP]
[CLS] your grandparents ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nah , ' ' i chuckle , ` ` they just decided that florida was more their scene is all . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t want to go through the has ##sle of selling this place . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re , uh , pretty well off , my grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] good people , but loaded as hell . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not a very typical combination , is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson replies gruff ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks over as me as i ave ##rt my eyes , embarrassed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean you . [SEP]
[CLS] i just - ' ' ` ` did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not , ' ' emerson says , reaching for my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you not four hours ago how i feel about you , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not just some rich girl to me . [SEP]
[CLS] christ , i would never hold you accountable for your family . [SEP]
[CLS] that would mean you could hold me accountable for mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good point . [SEP]
[CLS] and i would n ' t dream of it , for the record , ' ' i laugh shortly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` though apparently , we ' re about to have our shitty families joined in holy mat ##rim ##ony . [SEP]
[CLS] so . . . congratulations to us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or something , ' ' emerson gr ##umble ##s , shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a terrible fucking idea . [SEP]
[CLS] they do n ' t even know each other . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re going to make each other miserable . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' i reply , heaving a sigh , ` ` this is why marriage gets such a bad rap . [SEP]
[CLS] because asshole ##s like our parents fuck it up for everyone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously , ' ' emerson says , pulling out a cigarette . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t even have to ask for one this time , he just passes it my way . [SEP]
[CLS] he holds the lighter for me as i run the tip of my cigarette through the flame . [SEP]
[CLS] we in ##hale deeply in unison , peering up at the stars through the canopy of leaves above . [SEP]
[CLS] our fingers are still en ##twined , natural as can be . [SEP]
[CLS] that might be what hurts the most - the potential of a relationship that feels as easy as breathing , scattered by our parents ' careless ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not fair , ' ' i whisper , my eyes prick ##ling with tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not , ' ' emerson replies , pulling me tightly against his side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean jesus christ , their timing , ' ' i laugh , though nothing about this is funny . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no kidding , ' ' he replies , ` ` if they had n ' t shown up when they did . . . abby , i do n ' t know what would have happened back there . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] i know what i wanted to happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and . . . what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask softly , unable to look him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you know , ' ' he says , circling my waist with his muscled arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what i do n ' t know , at least for sure , is what you want out of this . [SEP]
[CLS] out of . . . us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my heart is lodged in my throat as i think of how to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to be bold now . [SEP]
[CLS] to tell him the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] even if i ' ve read him entirely wrong , and he thinks i ' m insane for what i ' m about to say , we ' ll be out of each others ' lives in a few months ' time . [SEP]
[CLS] so , here goes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if we had n ' t been interrupted , ' ' i say , softly but steadily , ` ` i would n ' t have stopped until we ' d had each other . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s all i wanted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he glances down at me , and i force myself to meet his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes sm ##old ##er with wanting me . [SEP]
[CLS] the intensity of his lust nearly bowls me over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what i wanted , too , ' ' he growls , catching my chin in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] he brings his mouth to mine , kissing me forcefully , deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] but there ' s a hint of final ##ity in his kiss that nearly brings me to tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are we supposed to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , pulling away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s wednesday . [SEP]
[CLS] no , thursday now . [SEP]
[CLS] by sunday , we ' ll technically be siblings . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that , ' ' emerson replies , his teeth gritted in hopeless frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and once that ' s the case , we ca n ' t . . . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course we ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] it would n ' t be right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing about this situation is right , ' ' he sc ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , ' ' i mutter , ` ` why could n ' t we have just found each other years ago , before we were out of time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not out of time . [SEP]
[CLS] yet , ' ' emerson says carefully , as if testing the waters . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart clench ##es tightly as he goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tomorrow is my birthday , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] saturday is yours . [SEP]
[CLS] that means that on saturday , and only on saturday , we ' ll both be legal adults . [SEP]
[CLS] legal , unrelated adults . [SEP]
[CLS] who can argue with that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you . . . are you suggesting . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , my eyes going wide . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if i do n ' t at least suggest it , ' ' emerson says , pulling me into his lap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll regret it for the rest of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] so , yes . [SEP]
[CLS] this is me telling you that i want you , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to be with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i want us to have each other , if only once in our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m suggesting that we give ourselves that before it ' s too late . [SEP]
[CLS] you can tell me i ' m nuts , or to go fuck myself , or whatever you like . [SEP]
[CLS] but i have to at least tell you . . . that that ' s what i want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , emerson , ' ' i say , struggling to take a deep breath , ` ` that ' s convenient . [SEP]
[CLS] because i . . . want that . . . too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we stare at each other for a long moment before bursting into up ##ro ##ario ##us laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] gut - bursting , tension - re ##lie ##ving , hysterical laughter that almost sends us both top ##pling off the platform at once . [SEP]
[CLS] i throw my arms around emerson ' s shoulders as we both roar at the insane , absurd hi ##lar ##ity of this whole situation . [SEP]
[CLS] a wave of relief crashes through me as laugh ##er wr ##ack ##s my body . [SEP]
[CLS] god , it feels good to let some of this pressure release . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that might be the most awkward thing i ' ve ever said in my life ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i crow , wiping tears from my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this may be the most awkward conversation that ' s ever occurred between two people , ' ' emerson replies , ` ` ' hey , i know you ' re about to be my sister , but i really want to do you . ' ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that sets us off again . [SEP]
[CLS] we collapse into each other until we end up lying on our backs , chests heaving , staring up at the stars . [SEP]
[CLS] our hands are clasped , our smiles wide . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the crap ##iness of the whole situation , here we are together . [SEP]
[CLS] on the same page . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` promise me it will happen , ' ' i say to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` promise me that on my birthday , we ' ll get to be together . [SEP]
[CLS] the way we want to be . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise , ' ' emerson says , giving me a sweet , cha ##ste kiss on the forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . [SEP]
[CLS] um . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope you do n ' t mind if i ask another sort of awkward question , ' ' emerson goes on , his fingers tightening ever - so - slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shoot , ' ' i tell him , turning my head his way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , i ' m no novice , when it comes to sex , ' ' he begins , delightful ##ly blunt as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been with a few girls in my time . [SEP]
[CLS] but in your case . . . i guess what i mean is . . . have you ever . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my smiles fades at once as i jerk my face away from his . [SEP]
[CLS] he senses my entire body tense up in the wake of his question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit , ' ' he groans , ` ` that was so stupid of me - ' ' ` ` no , ' ' i cut him off , steel ##ing myself for what i have to say , now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it was n ' t stupid . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . not an easy question for me to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] that does n ' t mean i ' m not going to , it ' s just . . . bear with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he squeeze ##s my hand , but does n ' t say a word . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a breath and go on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was going to tell you this earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] when we were trading secrets . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to explain what happened at the diner tonight , but i was afraid that you . . . anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] the short answer to your question is , yes , i ' ve had sex before . [SEP]
[CLS] the slightly longer answer is that i did n ' t really want to . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t want to at all , actually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , abby . . . ' ' emerson says , his voice as soft as i ' ve ever heard it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mean - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was back in freshman year , ' ' i go on , pl ##owing ahead before i lose my nerve . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was sort of a late bloom ##er , so i was really only beginning to get attention from some guys at our school . [SEP]
[CLS] there was one in particular that i ' d had a crush on since about kindergarten . [SEP]
[CLS] he and i were at the other middle school , not yours . [SEP]
[CLS] anyway , he teased me pretty mer ##ci ##lessly through eighth grade - for being smart , for always having my nose in a sketch ##book , all that . [SEP]
[CLS] but come high school , that teasing gave way to flirting . [SEP]
[CLS] and we started , uh , hanging out . [SEP]
[CLS] right when my mom died , he was still sort of in the picture . [SEP]
[CLS] we were n ' t dating or anything , but we were spending time together . [SEP]
[CLS] i went over to his place one night when my dad was wasted , just to get out of the house for a minute . [SEP]
[CLS] his parents were away , so it was just us . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d broken into his dad ' s liquor cabinet and offered me something to drink . [SEP]
[CLS] said it would make me feel better . [SEP]
[CLS] i had some boo ##ze , he gave me more . [SEP]
[CLS] he over - poured my drinks . [SEP]
[CLS] i got drunk . [SEP]
[CLS] then he started touching me , pushing me further than we ' d been before . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , we ' d only really kissed . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was feeling me up , trying to und ##ress me . [SEP]
[CLS] i told him to stop , i was too wasted to enjoy it , to want it . [SEP]
[CLS] but he kept on me . [SEP]
[CLS] said that would make me feel better , too . [SEP]
[CLS] he was much bigger than me , and i was so far gone . [SEP]
[CLS] i passed out in the struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] when i woke up a few hours later , i was naked from the waist down . [SEP]
[CLS] he was asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] passed out . [SEP]
[CLS] there was some blood on my thighs , and . . . you know . . . everything else . [SEP]
[CLS] i got dressed , went home , and took a shower . [SEP]
[CLS] he and i never spoke again . [SEP]
[CLS] the only other person who knows this besides you is riley . [SEP]
[CLS] but i need you to know . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s important to me that you do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a heavy , thick cloud of silence descends as emerson ' s jaw pulses with rage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this guy , ' ' he says , his voice ragged , ` ` it was tucker . [SEP]
[CLS] was n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' i whisper , ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] it was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , i ' m so sorry , ' ' emerson says , ` ` i ' m so sorry that happened to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry no one was there to help you . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' d known - ' ' ` ` what , you would have beat him up for me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tease , trying to force a little bit of levi ##ty into my confession . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for starters , ' ' emerson says res ##ol ##ute ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would n ' t fix anything , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` even if i ' d told someone , no one would have believed me . [SEP]
[CLS] i only would have gotten a reputation for being a lying whore at school . [SEP]
[CLS] with his popularity , his family ' s reputation in town . . . i would n ' t have stood a chance . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d rather get to leave this place behind and forget about every one of these asshole ##s than give them the satisfaction of dragging me through the mud . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just . . . i wish there was anything i could do for you , ' ' emerson says , ` ` to make things better . [SEP]
[CLS] anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is a pretty good start , ' ' i tell him , giving his hand a squeeze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t change the past , you know . [SEP]
[CLS] but we do get to decide what the future looks like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' he says softly , tucking my hair behind my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the sky is just starting to light ##en overhead as we make our way back inside . [SEP]
[CLS] we have school later today , as mundane as it is to think of . [SEP]
[CLS] we pause at the top of the stairs , just before peeling off toward our own rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lays his hands on my bare upper arms , looking at me intently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for telling me everything , ' ' he whispers , ` ` it means so much that you can trust me with that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d trust you with anything , ' ' i reply , taking his face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] standing on my tip ##to ##es , i kiss him earnest ##ly , swiftly . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , he does n ' t hold what i want just out of reach . [SEP]
[CLS] we step away from each other and dart into our rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] as my face hits the pillow at last , i realize the en ##or ##mity of everything that ' s come to pass in these last 24 hours . [SEP]
[CLS] the diner incident . [SEP]
[CLS] the impromptu date night and steam ##y make out session with emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] dad and de ##b ' s big announcement . [SEP]
[CLS] my confession to emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] our agreement for my eighteenth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` man , ' ' i sigh , drifting off to sleep , ` ` i ' d better give this to riley in small doses , or else she ' s going to lose her shit . [SEP]
[CLS] permanently . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter six sure enough , my best friend is fl ##ab ##berg ##ast ##ed and delighted when i give her the scoop of all that ' s gone down with me since last we spoke . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve decided to spend gym class huddled at the top of the football field b ##lea ##chers , now that our teacher has given up on trying to make us participate in class . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a good thing , too , because the sq ##ue ##al that riley emi ##ts when i let her in on my and emerson ' s plans for saturday would be enough to burst any una ##ccus ##tom ##ed ear ##drum ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the fucking fuck ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shriek ##s , shoving her hands through her black curls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is too much . [SEP]
[CLS] in the best way possible . [SEP]
[CLS] where is it go ##n na go down ? [SEP]
[CLS] what are you go ##n na wear ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if the sex is just too good and you have to rush off and el ##ope just to beat your parents to the punch so that they ' re the fucked up ones ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , whoa . [SEP]
[CLS] slow down , tiger , ' ' i laugh , ` ` neither of us expects this to be a long term thing . [SEP]
[CLS] it ca n ' t be , with our parents getting married . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' d probably hardly even see each other after graduation , anyway , even if they were n ' t tying the knot . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a one ##time thing . [SEP]
[CLS] a gift to ourselves . [SEP]
[CLS] please do n ' t get your hopes up for some happy ending . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who do you think you ' re talking to ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sc ##offs , ` ` my imagination can wr ##ing a happy ending out of any situation . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m holding out hope for you two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish i had your optimism then , ' ' i laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ca n ' t believe you told him about . . . you know , ' ' she says , growing somber . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must really trust this guy , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know it ' s crazy , but i really do , ' ' i tell her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it might blow up in my face and ruin me for life , but hey , nothing ' s been able to ruin me yet . [SEP]
[CLS] so , i like my chances . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re plenty optimistic , ' ' riley says , raising an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] optimistic - is ##h . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] later that evening , i ' m curled up on the couch going through some mind - numb ##ing calculus homework . [SEP]
[CLS] i have my head ##phones in , trying to drown out de ##b and dad ' s pre - wedding chatter with some kings of leon . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re huddled over the kitchen table , going over the last - minute plans for their spur - of - the - moment wedding ceremony and honeymoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t even think about how ex ##cr ##uc ##iating it will be for emerson and i to be alone here for the whole week of their honeymoon , unable to touch each other ever again . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe riley will let me crash at her place . [SEP]
[CLS] or i guess i could just invest in a cha ##sti ##ty belt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey honey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b chi ##rp ##s happily as emerson stroll ##s in through the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] i look up as he enters and tug out an ear ##bu ##d , in case we ' re all about to have a family meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi mom , ' ' he replies shortly . [SEP]
[CLS] to my surprise , he makes a bee ##line to where i ' m sitting on the couch and pl ##ops down next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel una ##cco ##unt ##ably nervous to be near him in our parents ' presence . [SEP]
[CLS] what if they can sense what ' s gone on between us ? [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , they ' re oblivious to the end . [SEP]
[CLS] for once , their na ##rc ##iss ##ism is working in our favor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our best man and maid of honor , here together , ' ' de ##b goes on , clasp ##ing her mani ##cured hands in el ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when did that get decided ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask under my breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t look at me , ' ' emerson replies , ` ` it ' s the first i ' m hearing of it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll need you kids up bright and early on sunday morning , ' ' my dad calls over to us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ve got the justice of the peace booked from noon until half past . [SEP]
[CLS] got ta make it snap ##py . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how romantic , ' ' i observe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and guess what else , ' ' dad goes on , his cheerful ##ness d ##wind ##ling just a hair , ` ` grandma jillian and grandpa frank are going to be here to celebrate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , raising my eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents , frank and jillian rowan , ad ##ore me , but their relationship with my dad is rather spot ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] grandpa frank is pretty critical of my dad ' s history of ` ` free ##loading ' ' off their old money . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they insisted , ' ' my dad smiles tightly . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s actually something of a comfort that dad does n ' t get along with his parents , either . [SEP]
[CLS] just goes to show that it runs in the family . [SEP]
[CLS] grandma and grandpa have been supporting our little family since i was born . [SEP]
[CLS] they really adored my mom , sandy , and pretty clearly thought she was doing my dad a favor by sticking around . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the money for my schooling , clothing , and extra ##cu ##rricular ##s still comes from them . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve even offered to pay my way through college . [SEP]
[CLS] well , whatever i ca n ' t cover with scholarships , that is . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be sure to get to the church on time , ' ' emerson says with sarcastic enthusiasm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i wo n ' t be around much beforehand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , whipping around to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell is he talking about ? [SEP]
[CLS] he has to be around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean , emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b presses her son . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a friend of mine is throwing me an eighteenth birthday party at his parents ' beach house this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] a whole bunch of people are going to be there , ' ' emerson says casually . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , my stomach flipping over . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s ditch ##ing me , and our rather important plans , to hang out at the beach ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . . . well , that ' s nice ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve always been such a popular boy , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s good that you ' ll be with your friends on your birthday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh , ' ' emerson says , examining his fingernails . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess it ' ll just be the three of us celebrating your birthday then , abby , ' ' my dad says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so it would seem , ' ' i reply , glaring at emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel a hard knot forming in my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] was he just messing with me last night , when he told me that he wanted me ? [SEP]
[CLS] has he been telling all his friends about how his per ##vy almost - steps ##ister secretly wants to jump his bones ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i let my guard down . [SEP]
[CLS] i should know better than to trust anyone at all . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , you know what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , finally shifting his gaze my way , ` ` my friends probably would n ' t mind too much if you tagged along , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve got a spare seat in the car . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you . . . i . . . what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer , un ##com ##pre ##hend ##ingly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you should go , abby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b says enthusiastically , ` ` you do n ' t want to hang out with us old far ##ts on your birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] go have fun with emerson and his friends ! [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t you think she should , bob ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' my dad says , ` ` sounds like it could be a fun time for you kids . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you say , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a glint in his blue eyes , a spark of secrecy . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t quite know what he ' s up to , or why he ' s scrapped our plans for the weekend , but anything would be better than being stuck here alone with our parents on my birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i say flatly , leaning back against the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds . . . great . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as long as you ' re on time for the wedding , ' ' my dad reminds us warning ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` super , ' ' emerson grins , snatch ##ing away the bag of milano cookies i ' ve been nos ##hing on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll leave tomorrow after school . [SEP]
[CLS] get as much out of the weekend as we can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good , bro , ' ' i say , glow ##ering at him as he steals my snack . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , is n ' t that just so precious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b grins , as emerson disappears upstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch his retreating back , my mind reeling . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m hurt , and confused , and incredibly disappointed about our plans being scattered . [SEP]
[CLS] how can he think it ' s ok to just blow me off like this , after everything i shared with him last night ? [SEP]
[CLS] it does n ' t make any sense . [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed just as eager to have some . . . alone time together as i did . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell gives ? [SEP]
[CLS] my concentration has been absolutely demolished . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no way i ' m getting any more homework done today . [SEP]
[CLS] unwilling to listen to my parents ' sick ##ly - sweet chatter , i head up to my own room , lock the door , and whip out my battery - operated boyfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' m not going to get any action this weekend after all , i ' d better stock up on the self love every chance i get . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m well accustomed to taking care of myself , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] still smart ##ing from emerson ' s dismissal , i leave for the school the next morning without even sticking around to wish him a happy birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] i halfway expect the rest of the student body to burst out laughing as i hurry into school , convinced that emerson will have spread the word about what a dramatic weird ##o i am . [SEP]
[CLS] but as usual , my entrance into homer ##oom goes unnoticed by all my peers save riley . [SEP]
[CLS] my best friend waves me over , noticing at once that i ' m in a terrible mood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks , as i sit down beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you know , ' ' i sigh , ` ` just everything in the entire world . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , she takes my hand and tow ##s me toward the classroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] our teacher , a bel ##ea ##gue ##red , bald ##ing man in his fort ##ies , looks up from his game of computer sol ##itaire as we march past . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me , ' ' he says test ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where do you ladies think you ' re going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without missing a beat , riley spins around to face him , plants a hand on her hip , and says , ` ` we both just got our periods simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re super heavy too . [SEP]
[CLS] like , horror - movie level . [SEP]
[CLS] so we ' re go ##n na go take care of our woman issues together . [SEP]
[CLS] ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] bye ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the teacher ' s face drains of color as we tr ##ai ##pse out of the room and slam the door behind us . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of our school ##mates are in their classrooms already , so we ' re all alone as we beat a quick path through the halls and hole up in one of the girls ' bathrooms . [SEP]
[CLS] we squeeze ourselves into one of the larger stalls and settle down for a good long talk . [SEP]
[CLS] riley cracks a window so that she can enjoy a gossip - session cigarette , and i tell her about emerson ' s sur ##re ##pt ##iti ##ous change of plans for the weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that does n ' t make any sense , ' ' she says , putting her smoke out on the windows ##ill . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , letting my head fall back against the tile wall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s got to be more to it , ' ' she says res ##ol ##ute ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would he all but prof ##ess his love for you one night - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he prof ##essed his wanting to bone me , ' ' i correct her , ` ` not his love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' riley says , rolling her eyes , ` ` why would he prof ##ess his whatever , only to leave you high and dry ? [SEP]
[CLS] does n ' t follow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the expert on man - brains , ' ' i reply , ` ` you tell me what i ' m supposed to make of all this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just wait it out , ' ' she tells me , resting her hands on my shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure there ' s an explanation , here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] having un ##loaded some of my frustration , i feel like i can at least make it through the rest of the day without exploding . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll see how i feel once i ' m coop ##ed up in some beach house with a bunch of emerson ' s buddies . [SEP]
[CLS] as i step out of the girl ' s bathroom with riley right behind me , i very nearly crash into a wall of person that appears out of nowhere . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` christ , ' ' i mutter , stepping out of the way just in time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` watch where you ' re - ' ' ` ` there you are , ' ' a very familiar voice says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was looking for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up only to find emerson ' s blue eyes looking back at me . [SEP]
[CLS] i do my best to tam ##p down my automatic excitement at seeing him . [SEP]
[CLS] ca n ' t let him get me all ri ##led up , now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , fei ##gni ##ng indifference . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and why were you looking for me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because we ' re getting out of here , ' ' he replies , as if it ' s the most obvious thing in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right now . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you said we were heading out after school ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , even more confused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i say a lot of things , ' ' emerson shrugs , ` ` but right now , i ' m saying that you and i are getting in my chevy and blowing this pop stand . [SEP]
[CLS] what , are you afraid to miss math class or something , miss rowan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be an ass , ' ' i mutter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re so hell - bent on leaving now , fine . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s your freak ##in ' birthday , after all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s the spirit , ' ' he grins , turning on his heel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go , sis . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walks away toward the student parking lot , and i turn to stare at riley , bewildered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you waiting for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispers , giving me a little push , ` ` go with him ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all right , all right , ' ' i mutter , and set off after emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never straight - up ditch ##ed school before , but i ca n ' t let him see that i ' m nervous about this little operation . [SEP]
[CLS] struggling to appear cool as a cu ##cum ##ber , i duck through the front doors on his heels and hurry over to his chevy . [SEP]
[CLS] holding my breath as i slide into the passenger seat , it occurs to me as strange that there ' s no one else hitch ##ing a ride with us . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought we ' d be transporting at least a couple of emerson ' s meat head friends to the beach with us . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson steer ##s the chevy out of the school parking lot , and for a moment it seems that we ' re totally in the clear . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , until the security guard at the front gates looks up from his cross ##word puzzle with a scowl . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you might want to duck down in your seat a little , ' ' emerson tells me . [SEP]
[CLS] i obey , without daring to ask why . [SEP]
[CLS] the security guard lumber ##s out of his hut ##ch , signaling for us to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ease ##s up on the gas as we approach , rolling toward the gates . [SEP]
[CLS] but just as we ' re coming up on the school guard , my reckless companion floors it . [SEP]
[CLS] with a ra ##bid w ##hir ##r of the engine , we fly past the baffled guard and swing out onto the main road out of town . [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow down a terrified ye ##lp as i watch our school shrink behind us in the rearview mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` desperate times , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson laughs , slapping the steering wheel with his palms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand why you ' re so desperate to get to some stupid house party , ' ' i gr ##umble , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` even if it is in honor of your birthday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson raises an eyebrow at me , an amused grin spreading across his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holy shit , abby , ' ' he crows , laughing at my sur ##ly expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are , hands down , the most gu ##lli ##ble person on the planet . [SEP]
[CLS] did you seriously think - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , sitting up a little straight ##er , ` ` did i think what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you seriously think i was going to blow off what we planned for some stupid birthday party ? [SEP]
[CLS] damn . [SEP]
[CLS] i must be a better liar than i thought , ' ' he chuckles , pulling out a cigarette . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart in ##fl ##ates like a helium balloon as i catch his drift . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean , ' ' i breathe , ` ` we ' re still on ? [SEP]
[CLS] for . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course we ' re still on , ' ' he says , glancing my way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think i ' d actually miss the chance to follow through on my promise to you ? [SEP]
[CLS] you must be out of your damn mind , lady . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but then why - ? [SEP]
[CLS] what - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer , smiling despite myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had to feed bob and de ##b that house party bullshit , ' ' he explains , turning off onto the highway ramp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they may be the two most oblivious , self - centered people on the continent , but even they would have been suspicious if their teenage son and daughter had announced they were going off on a romantic seaside retreat together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know something sawyer , ' ' i say , beaming at his brilliance , ` ` you ' re a lot smarter than you look . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wish i could say the same for you , ' ' he sc ##offs playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you fell for that whole thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess my heart is just too pure and whole ##some for my own good , ' ' i kid , fluttering my eyelashes dai ##nti ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or you ' re just gu ##lli ##ble as hell , ' ' emerson replies , crank ##ing up the radio and laying on the speed as we so ##ar along the highway . [SEP]
[CLS] in a matter of minutes , my heart has been entirely men ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson had no intention of abandoning me after all , and certainly did n ' t run off and spread my secrets around the school behind my back . [SEP]
[CLS] but as happy as i am to be back on track with him , a little part of me is worried about the intensity of my reaction to the mere idea of losing him . [SEP]
[CLS] his smallest action has the power to send me soaring to new heights of bliss or drag me down to devastating low ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never intentionally let someone hold that much sway over my heart and mind . [SEP]
[CLS] never cared so much for someone to the point of trusting them so fully . [SEP]
[CLS] i have every reason to think that i can trust emerson not to hurt me . [SEP]
[CLS] but clearly , i ' m having trouble putting any weight on that faith in him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t go into this half - hearted ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] if i make the choice to trust him , be vulnerable and open with him , then i ' ve got to charge full speed ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] the quick ##est way to ruin this thing we ' ve got is to hold back from each other . [SEP]
[CLS] we both risked a lot even telling each other how we feel . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve come so close to breaking through each others ' iron - clad defenses . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s time to lower the walls once and for all . [SEP]
[CLS] as we race along in emerson ' s chevy , i reach for his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] without missing a beat , he gives my hand a squeeze , letting me know that i ' m safe and sound with him . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' m honest with myself , i ' ve known that all along . [SEP]
[CLS] and that might be the scar ##iest part of this whole thing . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seven at least one part of emerson ' s story was true - we are , in fact , spending the weekend at the beach . [SEP]
[CLS] only , instead of shack ##ing up with a bunch of other kids in someone ' s rich parents ' beach house , we ' re staying in a tiny motel in a room of our own . [SEP]
[CLS] i tease emerson as we pull up to the place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a motel ? [SEP]
[CLS] seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile , grabbing my backpack . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bit of a cl ##iche , is n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can set up a tent on the beach if you ' d rather , ' ' he shoots back , ` ` but this place has hbo . [SEP]
[CLS] so i hope you wo n ' t mind if i do n ' t join you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we get our keys from the front office , only drawing a slightly suspicious look from the man behind the desk . [SEP]
[CLS] but hey , emerson ' s eighteen now , and has the id to prove it . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' ll take a little getting used to - the whole being able to do whatever we please thing . [SEP]
[CLS] it may not be a huge deal , booking a motel room of our own , but it ' s cool all the same . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a taste of adult independence , and damn is it thrilling . [SEP]
[CLS] though not nearly as thrilling as what ' s set to go down in said motel room , that ' s for damn sure . [SEP]
[CLS] we find our room at the end of a long line of doors . [SEP]
[CLS] the motel sits right on the edge of the dunes overlooking the long island sound . [SEP]
[CLS] the spring air is just cool enough to be refreshing , and the sun is just beginning to set over the water . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson pushes open our door , and we step over the threshold together . [SEP]
[CLS] my reservations about staying in a motel eva ##por ##ate as i take in the space . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a qu ##aint , simple room , well kept and cozy . [SEP]
[CLS] i spot a deep bath ##tub through the open bathroom door , a huge window with a view of the sea . . . and a big queen bed right in the center of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing that big - enough - for - two bed makes this whole thing real for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m finally going to sleep with emerson sawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] after all these years of wanting him from afar , he ' s right here beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re here with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s almost too good to be true . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t think that , i chi ##de myself , the second you think something ' s too good to be true , it usually is . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' emerson says with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m starving . [SEP]
[CLS] you go ##n na take me out for a birthday dinner or what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since you asked so nicely , ' ' i roll my eyes , ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] where do you want to go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he knows a place nearby , and drives us over to get some gr ##ub . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a tiny , seaside shack with maybe a dozen tables . [SEP]
[CLS] the menu is heavy on seafood and regional staples . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a warmth to the place that can only be captured during the offs ##ea ##son at a sleepy beach town . [SEP]
[CLS] in short , it ' s perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] we settle down into a table by the window and tuck into our complementary basket of biscuits . [SEP]
[CLS] the butter ##y , fl ##ak ##y pastry makes my eyes flutter closed with pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t eaten anything all day . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' d you know about this place ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask emerson , peru ##sing the menu . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my dad used to take me here when i was little , ' ' he replies , looking out the wide front windows toward the docks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' d come out fishing early in the morning , then stop here for lunch before driving home . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not fancy , but it ' s one of my favorite places in the world . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his face takes on a cast of sadness as he talks about his dad . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs to me that i barely know anything about emerson ' s father , or what happened to him . [SEP]
[CLS] i try to open up the conversation as delicately as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does he still live around here , your dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask carefully , reaching for another bis ##cuit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in a way , ' ' emerson laughs roughly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , he ' s still in the state . [SEP]
[CLS] or should i say , in state . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your dad ' s . . . incarcerated ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , pausing in my one - woman bis ##cuit - scarf ##ing contest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to be so formal about it , ' ' emerson replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s locked up . [SEP]
[CLS] has been for most of my life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow . . . ' ' i breathe , unsure of what to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s . . . so rough . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m pretty used to the arrangement by now , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but thanks . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mind if i ask . . . i mean , you do n ' t have to go into it . . . ' ' i fumble . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s ok , ' ' emerson replies , ` ` you ' ve told me so much about your past , it ' s only fair that i be open with you too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we pause our conversation long enough to place our orders with the young , friendly waitress . [SEP]
[CLS] once she ' s taken our menu ##s away and left us alone once more emerson takes a breath and begins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my parents got married pretty young , ' ' he tells me , ` ` for a while , they really were happy . [SEP]
[CLS] they never had much in the way of money , but when you look at old pictures of them , it always looks like they ' re having a blast . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t until they started trying to start a family that things got sort of . . . complicated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` complicated how ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` complicated in that it did n ' t work for them at first , ' ' emerson goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they kept trying to get pregnant without any luck . [SEP]
[CLS] their doctors told them that fertility treatments , iv ##f and all , might help things along . [SEP]
[CLS] the problem is , those treatments cost money , and my parents did n ' t have any . [SEP]
[CLS] but they were hell bent on having a kid , so my dad - peter - decided to get a little creative with the whole money - making thing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and when you say creative . . . ' ' i prompt him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean he started selling drugs to make some extra money , ' ' emerson says blunt ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing major . [SEP]
[CLS] just weed , mostly . [SEP]
[CLS] and it worked , too - they were able to rake in enough extra cash that iv ##f was suddenly on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] my mom was finally able to get pregnant with yours truly . [SEP]
[CLS] which was all well and good , until i was eight or so . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s when the dealing finally caught up with my dad . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t just selling the drugs . [SEP]
[CLS] both my parents had already started having issues with substance abuse by then , and my dad got in a really nasty car accident while under the influence that brought everything out into the open . [SEP]
[CLS] he went away , my mom got worse , and i was left to take care of it all . [SEP]
[CLS] i did , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i have been since i was eight . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , it ' s because they wanted me so badly that they started down that road at all . [SEP]
[CLS] it only seems fair , you know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , ' ' i say softly , reaching for his hands across the table , ` ` you know that none of that is your fault , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sure , ' ' emerson shrugs , ` ` i know that . [SEP]
[CLS] in theory . [SEP]
[CLS] but it ' s hard not to feel kind of ob ##liga ##ted to them now , no matter how badly they mess up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know what you mean , ' ' i nod , ` ` i feel the same way about my dad . [SEP]
[CLS] like , since he lost mom , i always have to be there for him , even if he barely gives me the time of day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look at us , ' ' emerson laughs , ` ` a couple of bleeding hearts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess so , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] our bo ##unt ##iful plates of food arrive - crab cakes for emerson , vegetable pot pie for me - and we dig in eagerly , pl ##owing through every bite of butter ##y , flavor ##ful goodness . [SEP]
[CLS] we even go in for a couple slices of blue ##berry pie to top things off . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m surprised we do n ' t roll out of the restaurant at the end of our meal . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time we make it back to the motel , we ' re happy , sleepy , and more than a little hands ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] my every nerve si ##zzle ##s with anticipation as emerson unlock ##s our motel room love nest and walks in before me . [SEP]
[CLS] he flop ##s onto the soft queen bed , and i tentatively ease myself down next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole being - alone thing is still so novel for us that i find myself feeling a little shy . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson can sense that i ' m still getting my bearings , so he just lets me curl against his side there on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] his arms close around me as i press my back against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] we drift into a post - dinner nap , the sound of the waves coco ##oning us as we lay there . [SEP]
[CLS] even in half - sl ##umber , i can feel my body responding to emerson ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] our chests rise and fall together , our limbs shifting to accommodate each other . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s so simple , so easy . [SEP]
[CLS] like we were built for each other . [SEP]
[CLS] by all rights , i should be feeling so much pressure and anxiety about what we ' ve promised to give each other this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' ve never felt more at peace . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know how much time goes by before i turn myself to face emerson there on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] his blue eyes ease open as i lay my head next to his on the pillow . [SEP]
[CLS] our mouths twist into matching grins as he runs a hand along the curve of my waist , and i rest my hands on his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , he brings his lips to my neck , kissing me slow and deep . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches as his lips move down my throat , across my cl ##avi ##cle , over my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] my blonde hair is sp ##lay ##ed across the pillow beneath me as i writ ##he bliss ##fully at his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] i run my fingers through his to ##us ##led chestnut hair , tugging him closer toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] as i press myself flush against his body , i can feel that he ' s growing harder by the second , just from kissing me . [SEP]
[CLS] god , that ' s hot . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips continue to caress every inch of skin they can find as he slips his hand beneath my gray sweater . [SEP]
[CLS] the touch of his hand is cool against my flushed skin as he trails up my flat stomach , the tips of his fingers brushing against my ribs . [SEP]
[CLS] i hold my breath as i feel him reach around my back and un ##cl ##as ##p my bra with a flick of his wrist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` someone ' s had a lot of practice with bra clasp ##s , ' ' i tease breathless ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what can i say , ' ' he grins , ` ` i ' ve have very capable hands . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he finally brings his lips to mine as he cups my breast in his hand , running his thumb ever - so - lightly over my hard nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] that slight touch sends a pang of desire straight into my core , radiating out through my entire body . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue glances against mine , and i kiss him back , deeper and more urgently with every passing moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his hand skirt ##ing along my torso as i let my own fingers trail down the hard , rip ##pling line of his abs . [SEP]
[CLS] he groans softly as i trace the length of his stiff member through his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath as emerson pops open the button of my jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling me close , he slips his hand between my jeans and panties . [SEP]
[CLS] my sex is aching for his touch , and i ca n ' t help but let my knees fall apart , spreading my legs wider for him . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingertips brush against the thin panel of cotton covering me , already wet with desire for him . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab onto handful ##s of bed ##ding as he pushes aside my panties and rests two strong fingers against my throbbing sex . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , ' ' i breathe , my head falling back against the pillow as he traces a long , slow line along my slit . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t form any other word besides his name , whisper it over and over again as he strokes me , parting me a little deeper each time . [SEP]
[CLS] i bury my face in his chest as he ro ##ves along my sex , laying those two expert fingers against the hard nu ##b of my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been touched like this by a guy , never gotten off with anything that was n ' t battery - operated before . [SEP]
[CLS] for the brief ##est moment , i worry about whether or not i ' ll be able to come with him . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , before he starts tracing long , slow circles around that bundle of nerves , rubbing with just the right amount of force . [SEP]
[CLS] a sweet , aching pressure starts to build in my core as he picks up the pace , rubbing and flicking my clit in a way i ' ve never felt before . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches as he goes on , switching up speed and motion just at the right moment , never leaving me hanging for a second . [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth falls open with wonder as i reach my tipping point . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m right on the edge of spilling over with pleasure when he says : ` ` come for me , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and i do , a shudder of bliss rolls through my body as i clutch onto him with all my might . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve had orgasm ##s of my own creation before , but never have i come with another person . [SEP]
[CLS] and certainly not for another person . [SEP]
[CLS] spent , i fall back against the bed , my chest heaving . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lays down beside me , resting a hand on my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` holy shit . . . ' ' i breathe , ` ` i think you ' ve killed me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could n ' t help myself , ' ' he murmurs , ` ` nothing turns me on like seeing you let go . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the sex ##iest thing , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you have no idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so then . . . are we go ##n na . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , glancing down at his gorgeous body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope . [SEP]
[CLS] we already decided on tomorrow , ' ' he grins mischievous ##ly , ` ` that was just to hold you over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , ` ` but - ' ' ` ` we ' re sticking to the plan , ' ' he says firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tomorrow , when you ' re no longer a the younger woman , it ' ll be a different story . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u ##gg ##hh , ' ' i groan , burying my face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess you have a lot more will power than i do , then , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the thrill of the chase , ' ' he grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' i say , with mock stern ##ness , ` ` do n ' t torment me , now , or i wo n ' t give you your real birthday present . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you got me a present ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , seeming genuinely touched . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nothing , really , ' ' i reply , wanting to temper his expectations some . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just . . . i thought you might like it , so . . . ' ' ` ` well , come on then ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##claim ##s , sitting upright , ` ` show me the goods ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are n ' t you supposed to be a grown ##up now or something , emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back , fei ##gni ##ng impatience as i swing my feet over onto the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] really , i think his enthusiasm is down ##right adorable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nah . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t plan on being a grown ##up anytime soon . [SEP]
[CLS] being a legal adult is n ' t going to change that , ' ' he declares . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , we should drink to that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` drink ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , as i grab my backpack off the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know your dad just keeps this stuff in the house for company , ' ' emerson goes on , snatch ##ing up his own overnight bag , ` ` so i figured he would n ' t mind if we pi ##lf ##ered some . [SEP]
[CLS] dude had , like , twenty bottles in the basement . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s that for will ##power ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i watch as emerson produces a bottle of champagne , and ca n ' t help but giggle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how fancy of you , ' ' i say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] does n ' t champagne in a motel room just scream class to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shoots back , searching around his bag for an opener . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or something like that , ' ' i say , my fingers finally closing around the sketch ##book i ' ve been hunting for . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull out the thick , weathered book as emerson pops open the bottle and pour ##s us each a st ##yr ##of ##oa ##m cup of the bu ##bbly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here you go , ma ' am , ' ' he smiles , handing me some champagne . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to not becoming grown ##ups until they literally force us to , ' ' he says , holding up his cup . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , touching the lip of my cup to his . [SEP]
[CLS] the fi ##zzy wine tick ##les my nose as i take a sip , sa ##vor ##ing the sweetness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks for the boo ##ze , dad , ' ' i add , tipping my cup in the general direction of our hometown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no , ' ' emerson groans , glancing down at my hands , ` ` tell me you did n ' t get me a book for my birthday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first of all , what ' s so bad about getting a book as a present ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s , like , the best present on the planet , ' ' i reply , and before he can protest i add , ` ` secondly , it ' s not a book . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just in a book . [SEP]
[CLS] here . . . ' ' he watches as i peel open the well - loved pages . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow , this feels nearly as intimate as what just went down between us on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly ever show my sketch ##book to anyone , yet here i am , flipping through the pages as emerson looks on . [SEP]
[CLS] sharing my art with someone has always felt impossible , something that required far too much trust for me to be able to do . [SEP]
[CLS] but emerson ' s teaching me that trust is n ' t something that ' s off - limits to me just because of my history . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' m even starting to believe him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are those all yours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his eyes glued to the pages . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , ' ' i reply , ` ` all of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re amazing , ' ' he says rev ##ere ##ntly , as i linger on a drawing of a stylized , distorted landscape . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please tell me you ' re going to major in art when you go to school in the fall . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i do n ' t know , ' ' i dem ##ur , ` ` i might try and focus on something a little more practical . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck practical . [SEP]
[CLS] these are incredible drawings , ' ' he ex ##claim ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . . . who knows ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i allow , ` ` it ' s not like there are any real jobs out there anyway , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] might as well major in something i actually like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s the spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] i think , ' ' emerson replies . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , i come to the sketch i ' ve been looking for . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s right at the end of the book , my most recent finished piece . [SEP]
[CLS] drawing a steady ##ing breath , i turn the sketch ##book around and pass it to emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes fall on the elaborate sketch and go wide . [SEP]
[CLS] he drinks in the image for a long moment before finally looking up at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is , ' ' i assure him , smiling at his amazement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we study the drawing together . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a portrait of emerson i ' ve been working on for weeks , since our first heated exchange at that party . [SEP]
[CLS] the drawing shows him in half - profile , staring with determined purpose from the page . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m really proud of how i was able to capture him , and i can tell he ' s impressed with the effort . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is how you see me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his voice surprisingly soft . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' i tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to me , that ' s the essence of who you are . [SEP]
[CLS] intelligent , strong , unwilling to back down from what you know is right . [SEP]
[CLS] from the things you want out of life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i . . . can i keep this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , looking up at me imp ##lor ##ingly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tell him , ` ` it ' s for you , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you to have it , always . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] placing the sketch ##book down with great rev ##erence , emerson leans forward and catches my lips in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' he murmurs , running a hand through my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s the best gift anyone ' s ever given me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i smile and lower myself onto my knees in front of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you ' re going to love this . . . ' ' i say with my best seductive grin . [SEP]
[CLS] i slowly undo his belt and un ##zi ##p his pants as he leans back , a look of utter disbelief on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] i can see the harden ##ing outline of his staggering cock growing down the inside of his jeans and my mouth begins to water instinctively . [SEP]
[CLS] oh how i ' ve dreamed of this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest as he lifts his hips and i pull down his jeans and boxers , un ##lea ##shing his throbbing dick . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s beautiful , i ' ve never seen one up close before , and his is absolutely amazing . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab it rev ##ere ##ntly , without thinking , and lower my mouth onto him , taking as much of emerson into my throat as possible . . . chapter eight when the early morning light draws me back up from the depths of sl ##umber , i ' m surprised to find that the bed beside me is empty . [SEP]
[CLS] i roll onto my side , peering around the hotel room for my missing companion . [SEP]
[CLS] even after one night , the feel of waking up without him does n ' t suit me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just about to roll out of bed and go searching for him when the motel room door ease ##s open . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson appears on the threshold , carrying two cups of take ##out coffee and a paper bag . [SEP]
[CLS] he sees me sitting up in bed and freeze ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit , ' ' he mutter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning to you too , ' ' i say , raising an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s just . . . i was going to surprise you , ' ' he says , closing the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here - just pretend to be asleep . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson . . . ' ' i moan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' he plead ##s , turning his back to dump the contents of the bag onto the dresser . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for me . [SEP]
[CLS] please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i flop back onto the bed and pull the covers over my head as emerson fu ##tze ##s with something across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i hear the click of a lighter , the cr ##ink ##ling of the bag , and finally emerson saying , ` ` ok . open your eyes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] pulling the covers down ever - so - slightly , i feel my heart melt into a puddle of goo in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson is walking toward me with a little makeshift breakfast in bed . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s my coffee , some cream ##ers , and a blue ##berry mu ##ffin with a couple candles in the shape of a 1 and 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] he places the tray in my lap with great ceremony , humming the happy birthday song . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on . [SEP]
[CLS] make a wish before it gets all wax ##y , ' ' he ins ##truct ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance up at him , wondering what on earth else i can wish for now that he ' s barrel ##ed into my life . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish that this all works out . . . i think to myself . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] i blow out the candles , and emerson sits down next to me on the bed , his own coffee and mu ##ffin hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you wish for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll tell you . . . if it ever comes true , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fair enough , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` happy birthday , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' i say , peeling the wrap ##per off my mu ##ffin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` adulthood is off to a pretty great start , do n ' t you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the day only gets better from there . [SEP]
[CLS] after i treat myself to a long , hot bath and get dressed for the afternoon , emerson and i head down to the beach for a long walk . [SEP]
[CLS] we take our time , talking all the while about our past ##s , our ideas , our notions about the future . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s planning on going to college , eventually . [SEP]
[CLS] but probably not this year . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be starting school in the fall , of course , but we do n ' t talk too much about that part - the never - seeing - each - other again part . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe we can find some way around the distance , if this whole thing does n ' t go up in flames . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ' ll be step - siblings tomorrow , so maybe it will be better to stay away after all . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t talk about that too much , either . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a little town center with shops and cafes down the shore a little ways , and emerson lets me take my time window shopping . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not much for designers or labels , but i love vintage and hand ##made things . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s one store in particular that i go nuts for - a local artist ' s shop that ' s cho ##ck full of gorgeous , eclectic jewelry and hand ##ic ##raf ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] i fall in love with one piece especially - a slender silver ring the bears a single pearl . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s so elegant , so simple . . . and unfortunately out of my price range . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , a girl can dream . [SEP]
[CLS] we spend the day wandering around the sleepy beach town , grabbing ice cream and coffee later on , sitting on the sand together , daring to dun ##k our toes in the still - icy water . [SEP]
[CLS] i field a few texts from riley , who claims ` ` i told you so ' ' right when i let her in on the real nature of my and emerson ' s beach escape . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remember protection , ' ' she texts me , ` ` and call immediately after this is not a drill . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise to call you the second i get off , ' ' i reply , ` ` maybe even during , if you ' re lucky . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do not play with my emotions , lady , ' ' riley warns me . [SEP]
[CLS] though i ' m more than excited for the night to finally arrive , i do feel a slight nervous ##ness starting to trip me up . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t really been with a guy since what happened with tucker all those years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] even though my memories of that night with him are hazy , i start to worry about flashbacks , or even just bad vibe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously , emerson is nothing like tucker , and tonight will be nothing like the night of my assault . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , i ca n ' t help but be a tiny bit anxious . [SEP]
[CLS] tonight ' s dinner is even more del ##ect ##able than the last . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson takes me to a little italian place in town with the best pest ##o i ' ve tasted . . . maybe ever . [SEP]
[CLS] after we ' ve polished off the last bites of birthday ti ##ram ##is ##u , it ' s time at last to head back to our room . [SEP]
[CLS] as if sensing the hush of anticipation , emerson crank ##s up the tunes on the way to the motel . [SEP]
[CLS] the postal service serena ##des us all the way back , and i hurry to throw on some iron and wine from my laptop the second we ' re back in the room . [SEP]
[CLS] awkward silence ##s are n ' t so terrible when sam beam cr ##oons over them , it turns out . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i both shu ##ck off our outer layers , and he moves to open up a second bottle of champagne . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' i tell him , accepting a cup of champagne and taking a generous sw ##ig . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just let me fresh ##en up a little , i ' ll be right out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take your time , ' ' he tells me , his eyes lingering on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] he can tell something is a little off , but is nice enough not to say anything outright . [SEP]
[CLS] i duck into the bathroom , drinking down the rest of my champagne and studying myself in the mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can do this , ' ' i whisper , coaching myself through my nerves , ` ` you ' ve wanted this for years . [SEP]
[CLS] since before anything even happened with tucker . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson is amazing , and he cares about you , and . . . and . . . ' ' ` ` everything ok in there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks at the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , my voice an octave higher than it usually is , ` ` totally fine ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' he says , in a voice that tells me he knows the truth , ` ` do you want to talk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sighing , i turn and gently pull open the bathroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on in , ' ' i say , trying to play off my embarrassment as i turn and sit on the edge of the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s going on up there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , glancing up at my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just . . . it ' s . . . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer , blushing as i try to string the words together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ve been talking about this all week . [SEP]
[CLS] you know . [SEP]
[CLS] the thing we decided to do today . . . ' ' ` ` oh , i know all about the thing , ' ' emerson smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i still really want . . . the thing to happen , ' ' i stumble ahead , ` ` but i ' m sort of out of practice . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve only ever done this once before , and that was n ' t such a great experience . [SEP]
[CLS] and i know it wo n ' t always be like that , but you actually know what you ' re doing , and - ' ' ` ` hey , hey , ' ' emerson says , wrapping an arm around me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s ok , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i understand completely . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have to keep anything from me , you know that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i do , ' ' i say quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , ' ' emerson says , taking my face in his hand , ` ` i ' m crazy about you , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] and i always will be . [SEP]
[CLS] now , because this world is a shitty , unfair place , we do n ' t have always . [SEP]
[CLS] because tomorrow , our parents are sw ##ooping in to fuck everything up . [SEP]
[CLS] we only have tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] but i would rather miss out entirely on having you than force you into anything you do n ' t want to do . [SEP]
[CLS] ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] i want you to want this as much as i do . [SEP]
[CLS] and if any part of you is n ' t interested , or is uncomfortable , then we do n ' t have to do anything . [SEP]
[CLS] just tell me what you want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bring my hazel eyes to emerson ' s , amazed by his level - headed ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d pass up on having sex on the only night we actually can out of respect for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i know , in this moment , that i can trust him . [SEP]
[CLS] and to be honest , i think i knew that all along . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m ready for this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what i want , ' ' i tell him , my voice dipping low once more , ` ` is for you to kiss me now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he does n ' t have to be told twice . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s lips brush against mine , softly at first . [SEP]
[CLS] we warm to each other in an instant , leaving our cups of champagne by the ways ##ide as our kiss becomes more earnest , more searching . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my arms around his broad shoulders , digging my hands into his chestnut hair . [SEP]
[CLS] he slips an arm around my waist , pulling me to him . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lifts me into his lap , cr ##ad ##ling me against his hard chest as our tongues glide and glance against each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the taste of him is more into ##xi ##cating than any champagne i ' ve ever tasted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take me to the bed , ' ' i whisper , kissing down along his throat . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel emerson slip an arm under my knees and effortlessly pick me up . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a solid foot taller than me , and probably about 75 pounds heavier , so i might as well be a feather in his arms - or so he makes me feel . [SEP]
[CLS] in a few quick strides , he ' s carried me out of the bathroom and over to the queen sized bed . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i ' ve imagined it a thousand times , he lays me out across the beds ##pre ##ad , drinking in the sight of me with his blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] only this time , it ' s better than what i ' ve imagined . [SEP]
[CLS] because this time , it ' s real . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` und ##ress me , ' ' i tell him , ` ` i want you to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson knee ##ls before me on the bed , his gaze burning with lust . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s right , ' ' he murmurs , his voice low and hoarse , ` ` i love it when you tell me what you want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he lifts the black cotton tee shirt up over my head , and shu ##cks off his own fl ##anne ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] catching my wrists in his hands , he pins them up over my head and lowers his body on top of mine , kissing me from the neck to the space between my breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] he flick ##s open the clasp of my bra and closes his teeth around the edge of one cup , glancing up at me with a devil ##ish wink . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a deep th ##ro ##b of need between my legs as he tugs my bra away with his teeth , then pulls the white tank top up over his head and immediately lowers his full lips to my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i suck in a huge breath as he wraps his lips around my taut nipple , his hands ro ##ving down my torso all the while . [SEP]
[CLS] the tip of his tongue flick ##s against the hard peak , sending a rush of sensation to the tips of my fingers and toes . [SEP]
[CLS] my head falls back against the bed as he sucks on my breasts , and i ' m so distracted that i almost do n ' t notice as he ease ##s the skinny jeans down off my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wore them , ' ' he grins , sitting back on his heels to admire my choice in panties . [SEP]
[CLS] i look down at the black lace thong barely covering my most intimate flesh . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the same pair i was wearing that night at the party , when we finally let each other in on how we really felt , if not out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] that night seems like e ##ons ago , but it ' s only been a matter of weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] look how much can change when you ' re honest about what you really want . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you ' d appreciate that , ' ' i whisper , letting my legs fall open before him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` appreciation does n ' t even come close , ' ' he growls , un ##buck ##ling his belt and tugging down his own jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] the rise in his black briefs ca n ' t be contained . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s hard as a rock for me , and absolutely huge . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson loops his fingers through the band of my thong and slowly , rev ##ere ##ntly , ease ##s it down my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] i lay before him , utterly naked , the cool air playing against my slick sex . [SEP]
[CLS] with his eyes locked on me , emerson tugs down his briefs , letting me see him in all his glory . [SEP]
[CLS] for a moment , it ' s all we can do to stare at each other . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson knee ##ls over me , his cock standing at full attention for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i drink in the sight of it , thick and throbbing with want . [SEP]
[CLS] without thinking , i bring my hands to his hard length - i need both to grab hold of it . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson groans as i knee ##l opposite him , working my hands all along his cock . [SEP]
[CLS] taking my lead , he lays back on the bed as i continue to stroke him , feeling him get harder in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] as his head hits the pillow , i ca n ' t wait any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] i bring my lips to the round , shape ##ly tip of him and close my lips around it . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes sc ##run ##ch up in bliss as i take his cock into my mouth , running my tongue along his tender shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] i work my mouth along him , using both hands to keep a firm grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] i love the feel of him as he fills up my mouth , the taste of him as he pulses for me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' he gasps , reaching for me , ` ` i need you . . . i need . . . ' ' ` ` tell me , ' ' i breathe , breaking away before running my tongue all around his bulging head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what you want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in reply , i feel his hands close around my hips and tug me up toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] i let him guide me , not knowing where this is heading but not caring too much either . [SEP]
[CLS] with firm hands , he turns my body around so that i ' m facing away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] before i can ask what he wants me to do , he ' s tugged my hips back toward his face , lying out beneath me . [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out in delighted surprise as he brings his mouth swiftly to my sex , licking along my wet slit from below . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches with pleasure as the tip of his tongue finds my rock hard clit , and i groan as he wraps his lips around it . [SEP]
[CLS] his cock is standing tall , harder than ever and far too delicious - looking to let be . [SEP]
[CLS] as emerson flick ##s his tongue across my aching clit , i lean forward and take him into my mouth as vo ##rac ##iously as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] we work each other into a frenzy , giving and taking as much as we can possibly manage . [SEP]
[CLS] how can something feel so illicit and so natural all at the same time ? [SEP]
[CLS] i suck hard on emerson ' s cock as i feel myself tee ##tering on the edge of orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] he must be able to feel it in me , because he takes out all the stops . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel him slide two strong fingers into me as he lick ##s along the length of me . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers pulse against that tender spot inside of me as the tip of his tongue flick ##s against my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] and just like that , i ' m a gone ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] i come hard as he laps up my desire , the room spinning around me . [SEP]
[CLS] as the orgasm shudder ##s through me , emerson rolls me onto my back . [SEP]
[CLS] i sp ##ra ##wl out beneath him , wide - eyed with bliss ##ful wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] word ##lessly , he reaches into the pocket of his discarded jeans and pulls out a condom . [SEP]
[CLS] ripping open the package with his teeth , he can scarcely keep his eyes off of me . [SEP]
[CLS] he rolls the condom down his pu ##ls ##ating length , and it finally hits me : this is really happening . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes are blazing as he lowers his taut body to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] wrapping my ankles around his tape ##red waist , i moan as i feel his swollen head pressing against my wet sex . [SEP]
[CLS] this is it . [SEP]
[CLS] at long last . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson locks his eyes on mine , and we might as well be the only two people on the planet . [SEP]
[CLS] he linger ##s there for just a moment , on the pre ##ci ##pic ##e of our knowing each other in an entirely new way . [SEP]
[CLS] my whole body is screaming to feel him drive into me , demo ##lish and rebuild me with the force of his need . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach up and take his face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m all yours , ' ' i whisper , my gaze steady on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] something blaze ##s behind his eyes as he brings his mouth to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he bucks his hips , pressing himself into me . [SEP]
[CLS] a moan fills my throat as he parts my silky flesh with his staggering length . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel him diving into the very core of me . [SEP]
[CLS] at last , he ' s all the way in , and i can scarcely believe that he fits at all . [SEP]
[CLS] but he does . [SEP]
[CLS] and it feels fucking fantastic . [SEP]
[CLS] our bodies move together , limbs tangled , chests heaving . [SEP]
[CLS] he drives into me as i pull him in further , each of us trying to feel as much of the other as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] a low , thud ##ding bliss is building inside of me once more , and i can feel him growing to fill me - he ' s right on the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] he thrusts hard and deep , his face screwed up in a mask of ec ##static wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab hold of his perfect , firm ass , pulling him in as far as i can as i tell him , ` ` let go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] both of our voices swell into a huge groan as he pu ##mmel ##s into me once more and comes , hard . [SEP]
[CLS] i clutch onto him as i feel him spa ##sm and gus ##h inside of me , gaze up at him as his mouth falls open into a perfect ` ` o ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] it feels like a year goes by before we even begin to come back down to earth again . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lowers himself down next to me on the bed , pulling me to his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] i rest my cheek on his hot skin , listening to the wild beating of his heart . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t formula ##te a single word to tell him what this has meant to me , that it was so much better than i ever could have hoped , and that i do n ' t know how i ' ll stand to never have him again . [SEP]
[CLS] but the thing is , i do n ' t need to tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] just laying here beside me , it ' s clear that he already knows . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter nine i arrange my blonde hair into a hasty up - do , trying to keep from crying . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been on the verge of tears since about five minutes after i woke up this morning - when i remembered what today is . [SEP]
[CLS] our parents ' wedding day . [SEP]
[CLS] the day that emerson and i become step siblings . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve changed into my maid of honor dress , a lavender sheath , and tried my best to apply fancy makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] we have to head right to the church this morning , just like we promised , and we ' re already getting kind of a late start . [SEP]
[CLS] i lock eyes with myself in the mirror , see the tears shining there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop it , ' ' i whisper , ` ` you ca n ' t cry now . [SEP]
[CLS] you always knew this was coming . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] but even though emerson and i had our one night together knowing full well that it would be our last , it does n ' t make it hurt any less . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping out into the hotel bedroom , i feel my heart clench painfully as emerson turns to face me across the space . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s wearing a simple gray suit , but it might as well be a tu ##x for how good it looks on him . [SEP]
[CLS] his hair is pushed away from his face , though the signature stubble i love so much is still in place . [SEP]
[CLS] his blue eyes are shining with remorse for what ' s about to happen and el ##ation at what passed between us last night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look beautiful , ' ' he says , his voice ragged with conflicting emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' i say softly , ` ` you look amazing , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , ' ' he says , moving to the motel mini - fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] he opens it up and takes out a co ##rsa ##ge in its little container . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a small sp ##ri ##g of lila ##c tied with an ivory ribbon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is this , prom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh tear ##fully , as emerson ease ##s the band of the co ##rsa ##ge up over my wrist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just as miserable as prom , probably , ' ' he grins wi ##st ##fully , lac ##ing my fingers through his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , do n ' t go overboard , ' ' i joke , stepping toward him . [SEP]
[CLS] without pre ##am ##ble , he pulls me into a tight embrace , pressing his lips ardent ##ly to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i take his face in my hands , kissing him hard . [SEP]
[CLS] we both know that this is the last kiss we ' ll ever share . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s closed - lip ##ped , almost sacred . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' ll never forget it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know how just yet , ' ' emerson murmurs , running his hands down my arms , ` ` but it ' s going to be ok , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re go ##n na make it through this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have to take your word for it , ' ' i say , shaking my head , ` ` because right now , i ca n ' t see how i ' m ever going to feel alright again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least we ' ll still be in each others ' lives , ' ' emerson says , searching for a silver lining . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` even if it wo n ' t be . . . how we ' d prefer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you know that i ' ll never stop wondering what might have happened between us , ' ' i whisper , ` ` you know . [SEP]
[CLS] if only . . . ' ' ` ` i know , ' ' he says softly , kissing me on the forehead , ` ` me too , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that we wo n ' t be able to utter another word without breaking into tears , we silently gather our things . [SEP]
[CLS] we stand in the threshold together , looking back at the motel room . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure that i ' ll ever be as happy again as i have been here . [SEP]
[CLS] as emerson closes the door behind us , it feels like something is being en ##tom ##bed here - some part of me that is lost forever . [SEP]
[CLS] i sink into the passenger seat of the chevy and stare out the window as we set off on the long drive back to our home town . [SEP]
[CLS] hopefully , by the time we get there , i ' ll find it in my heart to fake a smile or two for my father ' s wedding day . [SEP]
[CLS] things are already well underway at our home by the time we pull up . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad is waiting on the front steps , looking tense . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize my grandparents ' car , and another that must belong to the justice of the peace , in the driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there you two are ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad cries , beck ##oning us forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come in , come in . [SEP]
[CLS] frank and gillian are waiting to see you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s why he looks tense . [SEP]
[CLS] he and my grandparents are already sure to be butt ##ing heads . [SEP]
[CLS] i give dad a quick kiss on the cheek as i pass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look nice , daddy , ' ' i tell him , trying to be chip ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you too , sweetie , ' ' he replies distracted ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] a pang of sadness twists my core at our clipped address . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s taking so much away from me today , more than he could ever know , and for what ? [SEP]
[CLS] a shadow of the relationship we used to have ? [SEP]
[CLS] i force myself not to think of it as i hurry toward the kitchen with emerson in tow . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping inside , i spot my grandparents huddled over the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re dressed to the nine ##s - grandpa frank in an italian wool suit , grandma jillian in her favorite fur stole . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve always looked to me like first class passengers on some old - time ##y luxury cruise line . [SEP]
[CLS] the only things una ##ppe ##aling about their appearances today are the twin scowl ##s they try to cover up as i approach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abigail , ' ' grandma jillian smiles , air - kissing both of my cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] a soft wash of her signature chan ##el perfume brings back a million memories of tense family gatherings and et ##ique ##tte lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] i love my grandparents , but there ' s definitely a lot of pressure that goes along with trying to meet their expectations . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look gorgeous , dear , ' ' grandpa frank says , giving me a swift kiss on the hand . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re a beautiful couple , and look much younger than they actually are . [SEP]
[CLS] grandma ' s perfect crown of platinum blonde curls , grandpa ' s sw ##oo ##sh of silver hair , and their bright white smiles make them look like an advertisement for the swan ##kie ##st retirement community around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` grandpa , grandma , this is emerson - de ##b ' s son , ' ' i say , glancing emerson ' s way . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s got both hands shoved into his pockets , and his mouth is a hard , solemn line . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , ' ' grandpa says , without warmth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] hello , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' emerson nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m jillian . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s nice to meet you , ' ' grandma says , offering her hand for emerson to kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch , trying not to laugh , as he takes her hand and gives it a good solid shake instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here ' s the man of the hour himself , ' ' grandpa says , looking up as dad walks into the kitchen with the justice of the peace - a bald ##ing man with a cheerful red face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are we starting soon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] grandma asks , ` ` the girls are playing bridge at three and i ' d really prefer not to be late . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll start as soon as de ##b is ready , ' ' dad replies curt ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure she ' s just putting the finishing touches on - ' ' ` ` i ' m all set ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b sings out from the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] we all turn to watch her grand entrance as she cl ##atter ##s down the last few steps and st ##rut ##s her stuff our way . [SEP]
[CLS] i can practically hear my grandparents ' jaws crack against the tile floor as de ##b meets us in the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] her rhine ##stone - en ##cr ##ust ##ed heels must be five inches high , and fully visible beneath the micro mini ##dre ##ss that ' s serving as her wedding gown . [SEP]
[CLS] a huge , flowing bust ##le trails along behind her , and her already vol ##umi ##nous blonde curls are stacked a mile high in a hair ##do that would make the most seasoned pageant girl raise an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] her makeup looks painted on , most especially her hot pink lipstick . [SEP]
[CLS] she looks positively ec ##static . . . but not exactly the picture of the blushing bride we all had in mind - especially my grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe our wedding day is finally here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sq ##ue ##als , leaping into my dad ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she kisses every inch of his face , leaving little sm ##udge ##s of pink all over . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m a little concerned that my grandparents have literally turned to stone beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] dad manages to pry de ##b off of him long enough to turn her frank and jillian ' s way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` de ##b , ' ' my dad says through a forced smile , ` ` these are my parents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] my . [SEP]
[CLS] god , ' ' de ##b breathe ##s , sp ##lay ##ing her hands out over her heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are just about the fan ##cies ##t people i ' ve ever seen in my entire life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] well , ' ' grandma says , unable to form any additional words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is . . . some dress you ' ve got there , ' ' grandpa attempts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad , ' ' my own father hiss ##es warning ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , you like it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b chi ##rp ##s , giving us all a little spin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i got in at forty percent off . [SEP]
[CLS] still a rip off , if you ask me , but heck - it ' s a special occasion , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s not like bob here is hurting for money . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents ' eyebrows shoot up , disappearing into their hair lines . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b fa ##lter ##s , looking back and forth between them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] was that tack ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , so you are familiar with the word , then , ' ' grandma says cool ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at emerson , embarrassed by my grandparents ' icy behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] but his face is totally un ##rea ##dable - i have no idea if he ' s even listening . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b , not knowing what to do with my grandparents ' disdain , turns to emerson and me with a tight grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you two look so darling , ' ' she sighs tear ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our big happy family , at last . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i catch grandpa rolling his eyes as the justice of the peace clap ##s his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the jolly official says , ` ` shall we head to the backyard for the ceremony ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b grabs hold of my dad ' s hand and yank ##s him out the back door . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve set up a fl ##im ##sy white altar in front of the pool , which is filled with floating flower blossoms . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson walks out ahead of me , keeping his eyes straight ahead , and my grandparents bring up the rear . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b ' s heels sink into the grass as she tee ##ters toward the altar on my dad ' s arm . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson stands beside her , and i take my place next to dad . [SEP]
[CLS] the justice of the peace stands between them , and my grandparents move front and center , all but wr ##ink ##ling their noses . [SEP]
[CLS] the wedding of the century , indeed . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t make myself focus as the justice of the peace starts rattling through the motions . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i stand facing each other , looking over our parents ' shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never seen him look so miserable . [SEP]
[CLS] more than being upset for my own heartbreak , i hate our parents in this moment for causing emerson so much pain . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s been through so much already , and now this fia ##sco ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s more than anyone should have to bear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok then , ' ' the justice of the peace goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if we could have the rings . . . ' ' emerson thrusts them into my dad ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] our parents slip the ga ##udy tri ##nk ##ets onto each other ' s hands , grinning like two teenagers . [SEP]
[CLS] the words of their vows and even their ` ` i do ' s ' ' fade into white noise as emerson finally lifts his eyes to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] we stare at each other , laid bare in this anguish ##ed moment . [SEP]
[CLS] our gazes say what we never got a chance to : ` ` i care about you more than anything in this world . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so sorry you ' re in pain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and as our parents share their first kiss as man and wife , i try my best to tell emerson one more thing with my silent , pleading eyes : ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and as i look on , my heart breaking , i could swear his blue eyes tell me , ` ` i love you too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter ten by midnight the house is all but silent once more . [SEP]
[CLS] left ##over food and cake cl ##utter ##s every surface of the kitchen , crushed petals stain the floors , and the plastic flowers on the rick ##ety altar out back have started dropping off , one by one . [SEP]
[CLS] dad and de ##b have flown the coop , off on the first leg of their honeymoon in new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] grandma and grandpa beat a quick retreat after a bite of cake and three brand ##ies each . [SEP]
[CLS] the house , my home , feels like a crypt now . [SEP]
[CLS] but i suppose that ' s appropriate - i ' m certainly in mourning . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i , still dressed up in our wedding day best , sit side - by - side at the kitchen island . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s an open bottle of vodka and a gigantic round of wedding cake sitting between us , and we ' re helping ourselves to an abundance of both . [SEP]
[CLS] neither of us can think of anything productive to say , but are lo ##ath ##e to be alone tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] we sit there in silence , being careful not to brush elbows or even look at each other for too long . [SEP]
[CLS] as of this afternoon , when the ink dried on our parents ' marriage license , our relationship can only be strictly plato ##nic . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t been this miserable since my mom passed away . [SEP]
[CLS] this feeling of running up against devastating injustice is something i ' m all too familiar with by now . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , emerson ref ##ill ##s our glasses of straight vodka . [SEP]
[CLS] he snatch ##es up his glass and downs his boo ##ze in one swallow . [SEP]
[CLS] tearing off his neck ##tie , he st ##agger ##s to his feet . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him as he turns to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are you going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i murmur , the room spinning as i stand up after him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bed , ' ' he growls , not looking at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask around the sudden lump in my throat , ` ` it ' s just go ##n na be one word answers from now on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you expect ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he replies , keeping his back to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i expected you to . . . to be . . . ' ' ` ` your friend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sc ##offs , shoving a hand through his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was never going to happen , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you know that as well as i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have to at least try , ' ' i say softly , reaching out to touch him . [SEP]
[CLS] at the slightest brush of my fingers , he rip ##s his arm away from me , spinning around with fire in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t do that , ' ' he rage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no fucking way can i just be your friend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t yell at me , ' ' i say , steady ##ing myself against the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re drunk . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re upset . [SEP]
[CLS] this is n ' t you talking - ' ' ` ` as if you know the first thing about me , ' ' he fires back , shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one fuck , and you think we ' re soul mates or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop it , ' ' i tell him fiercely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know what you ' re doing . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re trying to hurt me . [SEP]
[CLS] trying to drive me away so that you do n ' t have to deal with what ' s happening . [SEP]
[CLS] well too fucking bad . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not going anywhere , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t scare me away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demands , stepping toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] he plants one hand on either side of me , ca ##ging me in against the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really think so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i do , ' ' i whisper , keeping my hazel eyes trained on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] our lips are mere inches from each other , our bodies all but pressed together . [SEP]
[CLS] the sudden proximity of him sets me to trembling . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t be strong enough for both of us . [SEP]
[CLS] i need his help . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , emerson , ' ' i say , blinking away the tears that blur my vision . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could you just . . . hold me ? [SEP]
[CLS] just for a second . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stares at me , his blue eyes frozen over . [SEP]
[CLS] but as the first tear rolls down my cheek , i watch the ice crack . [SEP]
[CLS] the fight goes out of him , making way for the despair he ' s been trying to cover up with aggression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come here , ' ' he murmurs , opening his arms to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i rush to him , throwing myself into his embrace . [SEP]
[CLS] he en ##fold ##s me in a fierce hug as the tears come hard and fast . [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses the top of my head , pulling me tightly against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t disappear on me like that , ' ' i cry , burying my face in the front of his suit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t get through this without you , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry , ' ' he says , his voice ras ##ping . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is just . . . it ' s so hard , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] what am i supposed to do without you in my life ? [SEP]
[CLS] the way i want you to be , i mean . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll let you know when i figure it out , ' ' i say mis ##era ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] we hold each other , each unwilling to be the first to break the embrace . [SEP]
[CLS] as the sky begins to light ##en , we finally tr ##udge upstairs , entirely spent . [SEP]
[CLS] i walk ahead of emerson , my body tired and aching . [SEP]
[CLS] the prospect of sleeping alone tonight is too much to bear . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s hard to believe that it was just last night that i fell asleep next to emerson , my cheek resting against his bare chest . [SEP]
[CLS] it feels like years ago that our bodies met , collided , moved as one . [SEP]
[CLS] it was , without question , the best night of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] and would you look at that ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s being followed up by the worst . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i reach the top of the stairs and pause , each glancing at our bedrooms at opposite ends of the hall . [SEP]
[CLS] turning away from each other now seems like the final step , the last nail in the coffin sealing up our barely - formed relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] after the wren ##ching , brutal es ##cap ##ade that was our parents ' wedding ceremony this afternoon , i do n ' t know if i can take it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , ' ' i say softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` today was sort of like a nightmare . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s for fucking sure , ' ' he murmurs , glancing my way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and after a nightmare . . . is n ' t is usually ok for a little sister to crawl into her big brother ' s bed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask tear ##fully . [SEP]
[CLS] a slow , sad smile spreads across his gorgeous face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice justification , weird ##o , ' ' he tease ##s softly , offering me his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i lace my fingers through his . [SEP]
[CLS] silently , we walk down the hallway toward his room . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t even have the energy to change out of our clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] with vodka - clouded heads and heavy hearts , we collapse onto his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson wraps his arms around me , pulling me close . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no question of things going any further between us now , but this simple comforting embrace is a bal ##m for my battered soul . [SEP]
[CLS] in an instant we ' ve fallen into a deep , mer ##ciful ##ly dream ##less sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m jerked out of sl ##umber the next morning by the sound of screaming voices . [SEP]
[CLS] pry ##ing open my eyes , i notice two things straight ##away . [SEP]
[CLS] first , i am massive ##ly hung ##over , having eaten next to nothing yesterday and had half a bottle of vodka to drink . [SEP]
[CLS] second , i ' m still lying beside the sleeping emerson , despite the fact that it ' s monday morning and school is set to start in a mere twenty minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] but before i can worry about my attendance record , the crash of shattering glass catches my ear from downstairs . [SEP]
[CLS] two hysterical voices rage at each other as other objects go hurt ##ling around the ground floor . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s eyes fly open at the sound of the un ##folding chaos , and we turn to look at each other , at a loss . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize dad and de ##b ' s voices at once , but i ' ve never heard either of them so ira ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` funnel ##ing my money to that low ##life junk ##ie ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad bell ##ows , as something heavy top ##ples over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your money ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b cries shrill ##y , ` ` you mean your parents ' money , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t start with that class warfare bullshit - ' ' ` ` i do n ' t have to ! [SEP]
[CLS] they already did . [SEP]
[CLS] you think i did n ' t see how they looked at me yesterday ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d think i was wearing a g - string and past ##ies - ' ' ` ` well , you were n ' t wearing much else ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] something else smash ##es into a thousand pieces , and i grab for emerson ' s hand , panicked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t try and change the goddamn subject , ' ' my dad snarl ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve been stealing from me for your sc ##umb ##ag ex and your loser drug baby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s fingers tighten around mine , his body rip ##pling with fury . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my son is not a loser ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b weep ##s , charging up the stairs , ` ` and he ' s not staying here in this house for another second ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the entire world grind ##s to a stands ##till as emerson ' s bedroom door flies open . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b appears in the doorway , thick ri ##vu ##lets of mascara co ##urs ##ing down her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i stare up at her , en ##twined in his bed , as my red - faced father appears on the top of the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] the four of us are frozen in a surreal table ##au , and for a second i hope against all hope that this is just another terrible dream but in the next moment , reality floods back in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the fuck is this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b shriek ##s , falling back against the door in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were just - we - ' ' i st ##am ##mer , looking helplessly at emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get away of my daughter , you piece of shit ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad roar ##s , charging into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabs me by my arm and wren ##ches me brutally out of bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad , you ' re hurting me , ' ' i gasp , trying and failing to break free from his grip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t touch her , ' ' emerson shouts , leaping to his feet and shoving my father away from me . [SEP]
[CLS] he shields me from my dad ' s wrath with his solid body , but my dad lung ##es for me all the same . [SEP]
[CLS] the smell of boo ##ze see ##ping off of him turns my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you drunk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp , staring at my father . [SEP]
[CLS] but his swaying stance and blood ##shot eyes answer my question . [SEP]
[CLS] i whip around toward de ##b and see that she , too , is standing un ##stead ##ily , unable to focus on a single point for more than a second . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not even nine o ' clock , and they ' re both wasted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jesus christ , mom , ' ' emerson growls , staring at his mother in disbelief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` again ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you judge me , ' ' de ##b snaps , shaking her mess of wil ##ted curls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you knew the sort of night i had . . . this man is a monster . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m a monster ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad returns , w ##hir ##ling un ##stead ##ily toward her , ` ` you ' re the lying , th ##ieving whore - ' ' ` ` emerson , no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sc ##ree ##ch , as he cock ##s back his fist and slams it against my father ' s jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] dad goes reeling through the open doorway , and emerson leaps after him . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b collapses into a tear ##y puddle as emerson and dad brawl on the landing . [SEP]
[CLS] i rush toward them , ready to throw myself into the fray . [SEP]
[CLS] but a loose punch from dad hits me square in the stomach , knocking me back against the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson snaps his face toward me , too worried about my well ##bei ##ng to focus on my dad . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the moment of his distraction , dad strikes back - sending a cracking blow railing against emerson ' s high cheek ##bone . [SEP]
[CLS] a sick ##ening crunch rings out through the house . [SEP]
[CLS] a scream rip ##s out of my throat as emerson stumble ##s against the second story railing . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad tries to grab him by the front of his suit , but misses . [SEP]
[CLS] in a burst of rage , emerson grabs hold of my dad and slams him against the ban ##nist ##er , ready to throw him off the landing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop it ! [SEP]
[CLS] emerson , stop ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i scream . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , i seem to get through to him . [SEP]
[CLS] with gritted teeth , he lowers my dad away from the edge , tossing him roughly onto the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] he raises his blue eyes to mine , and my heart shatter ##s as i see the furious tears streaming down his face . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping over my dad ' s drunken , pro ##stra ##te form , emerson marches into his room and snatch ##es his mother up by the arm . [SEP]
[CLS] she can barely stand , beside herself with wasted emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson swings her arm over his shoulders and all but drag ##s her away , carrying her dead weight down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , ' ' i call out , my voice a strangled cry , ` ` emerson , where are you going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] but he does n ' t answer me . [SEP]
[CLS] he simply makes his way to the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] i pull myself off the ground and race after him , grabbing for the back of his suit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , ' ' i plead , clutching the ban ##nist ##er as i reach the final stair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t go . [SEP]
[CLS] not now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pauses with his hand on the door ##k ##nob . [SEP]
[CLS] turning back to look at me , his eyes are full of hardened resolve . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s shut his heart out of the equation , i know . [SEP]
[CLS] and try as i might , there will be no reaching him now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodbye abby , ' ' he whispers , and wren ##ches the door open . [SEP]
[CLS] he guides his mother across the threshold and out to his chevy . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t until i hear the engine start that i sink down onto the stairs , hollow and cold . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s gone . [SEP]
[CLS] and this time , i know he wo n ' t be coming back for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance around the house , at all the artifacts of my childhood that were destroyed in dad and de ##b ' s wake . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , it ' s not the material things i gr ##ie ##ve for , now . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s my entire life as i ' ve known it . [SEP]
[CLS] the future that will never come to pass . [SEP]
[CLS] i sit there at the foot of the steps for hours , listening to my dad ' s anguish ##ed groans from the landing . [SEP]
[CLS] at some point , he manages to stand and pull himself into the master bedroom , slamming the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] he wo n ' t come down to check on me . [SEP]
[CLS] not in the state he ' s in . [SEP]
[CLS] but who am i kidding ? [SEP]
[CLS] even at his best , dad could n ' t be bothered to give a shit about me . [SEP]
[CLS] numb ##ness creep ##s through my body as i sit stock still , unable to process what ' s happened to me . [SEP]
[CLS] to emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] to our splinter ##ed family . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing that ' s happened this morning makes any sense . [SEP]
[CLS] what happened that set our parents to drinking like that ? [SEP]
[CLS] what was my dad saying about de ##b stealing from him ? [SEP]
[CLS] and what about my grandparents ' interference with dad and de ##b ' s brand new marriage ? [SEP]
[CLS] chapter eleven it ' s noon before i ' m torn out of my shocked rev ##erie by the sound of a car door slamming . [SEP]
[CLS] my pulse picks up as i pull myself to my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] has emerson come back home again after all ? [SEP]
[CLS] is he here to help me make sense of all this chaos ? [SEP]
[CLS] the front door cl ##atter ##s open , and a familiar face appears - but it is n ' t his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' riley breathe ##s , rushing to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , what the hell is going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` riley ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , unable to focus , ` ` riley , what - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispers , her voice tear ##ful . [SEP]
[CLS] she takes me in her arms , brushing the hair out of my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m . . . riley , what are you doing here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you know to come ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her already dark eyes cloud over as she wraps her arms around me . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s bracing me for something . [SEP]
[CLS] bad news . [SEP]
[CLS] but what ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t show up at school , ' ' she says softly , ` ` but emerson did . [SEP]
[CLS] he stormed in just as people were switching classes . [SEP]
[CLS] abby . . . he . . . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , looking at her with mounting dread . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did he do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rests her hands on my shoulders , take a deep breath , and goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he started screaming for tucker , ' ' she tells me , ` ` and when he finally found him , he . . . abby , he just beat the shit out of him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was brutal . [SEP]
[CLS] some teachers eventually pulled him off and threatened to call the cops . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s been expelled , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] he ran back out of the school and drove off . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t find you anywhere , so i thought . . . i was so scared . . . ' ' i stare at my best friend , un ##com ##pre ##hend ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart can take on no more anguish . [SEP]
[CLS] there is n ' t any room left . [SEP]
[CLS] i sink into a state of cat ##aton ##ic silence as riley gathers a change of clothes for me and leads me out of my house . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the last time i ever step foot in that place i once called home . [SEP]
[CLS] over the course of the tu ##mu ##lt ##uous next few months , the entire so ##rdi ##d saga comes out into the open . [SEP]
[CLS] on the morning after their wedding , dad and de ##b were about to head off to europe for a couple weeks for the second leg of their honeymoon . [SEP]
[CLS] dad visited the bank to get some travelers ' checks , but found that his accounts had been frozen because of some suspicious activity . [SEP]
[CLS] he and de ##b had already consolidated accounts when they moved in together , but dad has never been good about keeping track of his money . [SEP]
[CLS] only when it was pointed out to him by the bank did he notice the dozen or so transactions in de ##b ' s name . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been withdrawing money , keeping some in a separate account , presumably for her and emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest she ' d been wiring to her ex - husband , emerson ' s father , still serving time in connecticut state prison . [SEP]
[CLS] devastated by de ##b ' s betrayal , dad struck out to hurt her in the worst way he could think of . [SEP]
[CLS] he stocked up on boo ##ze , headed back to the hotel , and bait ##ed her into going on a bender with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she allowed it to happen , of course , but dad was the ins ##ti ##gat ##or . [SEP]
[CLS] only when they were both wasted in their hotel room in the wee hours of the morning did he turn on her . [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded an explanation , but the only one she had to give was that she ' d been using him . [SEP]
[CLS] she noticed him at aa - saw his nice clothes , fancy car , and sad eyes - and knew he ' d go for her . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b insisted that she developed real feelings for him later , and that she could n ' t just leave her ex - husband to rot in prison , but it was obviously too late . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s expulsion from our high school was immediate and iron ##cl ##ad , after what he did to tucker . [SEP]
[CLS] i have no idea what possessed him , in that moment , to target my ass ##ail ##ant from years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe he wanted to hurt someone who had hurt me , and given that he could n ' t throttle my dad the way he wanted to , went after tucker instead . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll never know what his motivation was . [SEP]
[CLS] all i know is that tucker ended up with two broken ribs and had to wear a neck brace to prom . [SEP]
[CLS] or so i ' m told . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not like i had any reason to go . [SEP]
[CLS] the bender dad started as pay ##back for de ##b did n ' t end the day after his wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] or the week after . [SEP]
[CLS] or the month after . [SEP]
[CLS] he descended into an alcoholic depression that far exceeded the one he ' d fallen into after mom ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t go back to his house - i did n ' t feel safe there . [SEP]
[CLS] i stayed with riley for a few days before my grandparents arrived on the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] they came up from florida and took me in to one of their nearby summer homes for the duration of the school year . [SEP]
[CLS] dad did n ' t even put up a fight when they took me away . [SEP]
[CLS] but he did tell them all about finding me in bed with emerson the morning after the wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] and even though nothing had happened between us that night , my grandparents looked at me a little differently from then on . [SEP]
[CLS] in no time at all , the marriage was ann ##ull ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] no one will tell me where emerson and de ##b have gone , and i do n ' t even know where to start looking . [SEP]
[CLS] but to be honest , i ' m too broken ##hearted to search very hard . [SEP]
[CLS] if emerson wanted me to know where he was , i ' d know . [SEP]
[CLS] as painful as it is , i have to accept the fact that he does n ' t want to be a part of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] even once our parents ' marriage is dissolved , there ' s no trace of him . [SEP]
[CLS] so be it . [SEP]
[CLS] i dive into the last semester of my school ##work , and end up graduating in the top ten percent of my class . [SEP]
[CLS] riley and i both decide to continue our studies in the fall at the new school in new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents agree to pay for the portion of my tuition that is n ' t covered by scholarships , and even let riley and me stay in the apartment they own in new york as an investment property . [SEP]
[CLS] i spend the summer by my best friend ' s side , slowly but surely coming to terms with everything that ' s happened . [SEP]
[CLS] i tell myself every day that come fall , i ' ll be able to leave the whole ugly mess of my childhood behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] and hopefully , my memories of emerson sawyer along with it . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter twelve new york city eight years later ` ` which do you like better ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask anxiously , holding two dresses up before me , ` ` the black , or the navy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley rolls her eyes at my outfit choices . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like it if you ever bought anything that you could n ' t also wear to a funeral , ' ' she replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you be serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i plead , ` ` my interview is in two hours , and god knows it ' s probably going to take me an hour to get there , and i might have to stop and find a starbucks to pee in first because i ca n ' t ask to pee during an interview - ' ' ` ` abby , ' ' riley says , taking my just - scrubbed face in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to nail this . [SEP]
[CLS] you are perfect for this job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare back at her , trying to have as much confidence in me as she does . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past six years , riley has transformed from a dissatisfied party girl to a successful pr powerhouse . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s traded in the cheap vodka for top - shelf martini ##s and the house parties for bottle service and chef ' s tables at all the best places in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve been living together since we were eighteen , and are closer than ever because of it . [SEP]
[CLS] but being close means being blunt , and she does n ' t hold back with me now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t take a breath and cool it , you ' re going to be kicking yourself all the way home , ' ' she says , marching me over to her closet . [SEP]
[CLS] she rum ##mage ##s through her colorful wardrobe and hands me an emerald green blouse and yellow pencil skirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here . [SEP]
[CLS] put these on . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re very . . . bright , ' ' i say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just like you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re interviewing at a creative agency , not a mor ##gue , for christ ' s sake . [SEP]
[CLS] a little color will be good , trust me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks , ' ' i sigh , taking the pieces and heading back into my room to change . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t fill them out as well as you , but . . . ' ' ` ` if you think i ' m going to cry you a river for having stayed the same size since you were seventeen years old , you ' ve got another thing coming to you , ' ' riley tells me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` speaking of getting older , though , what do you want to do for your birthday this weekend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing , ' ' i tell her through the crack in my bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not an option , ' ' she replies , as i slip into the clothes she ' s lean ##t me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i hate my birthday , ' ' i call back , pi ##ling my hair into a quick , wi ##sp ##y up do . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s still blonde , if a bit of a darker shade than when i was a kid . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all i ever want is to have a quiet night at home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you know that i ' ve never taken that for an answer , ' ' riley reminds me , rustling around the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my grandparents are already taking me out to some swan ##ky restaurant , ' ' i tell her , ` ` i owe it to them for letting us stay in this place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re not using it , ' ' riley reminds me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` still , ' ' i insist , ` ` living rent free is not exactly something to be taken for granted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not with what i spend on boo ##ze it is n ' t , ' ' riley agrees . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least let me take you out for a drink after your fancy dinner , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] you can give me all the juicy family gossip . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cr ##inge to think of what that gossip might be as i sw ##ipe some light makeup onto my face . [SEP]
[CLS] every time i see my grandparents , they spend at least an hour moaning about how badly my dad is doing . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s been in and out of rehab since breaking up with ` ` that woman , ' ' as my grandparents like to refer de ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] after the brawl that ensued the morning after his wedding , i no longer make an effort to include him in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] some things ca n ' t be forgiven , and the way he treated me that day is one of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll give you one birthday drink , ' ' i tell riley , grabbing my purse , ` ` but no surprise kara ##oke this year , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] or surprise strip ##pers . [SEP]
[CLS] or . . . you know what ? [SEP]
[CLS] just no surprises period . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cross my heart , ' ' riley smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' i say , stepping back out into the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? [SEP]
[CLS] how do i look ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fabulous , as ever , ' ' she says , giving me a quick once - over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re going to love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope so , ' ' i sigh , ` ` bas ##tian does such amazing work . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re one of the best new creative agencies out there . [SEP]
[CLS] it would be a dream to work for them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , tell them that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley insists , giving me a quick hug and a pat on the ass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go get ' em tiger . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i take a deep breath and march out of our upper west side apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been a few months since i finished my masters program in graphic design . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been able to freelance for a few different companies , and have built up my portfolio by doing so . [SEP]
[CLS] i never pictured myself having such a tech - based job , always sort of assumed i ' d stick with visual art exclusively . [SEP]
[CLS] but graphic design lets me be just as creative as drawing does , and employ my mind in other ways , too . [SEP]
[CLS] if i get this job as bas ##tian , i ' ll be designing and helping come up with marketing strategies for different companies and brands . [SEP]
[CLS] it would be something new every day , the perfect , totally consuming job . [SEP]
[CLS] just what i ' m looking for . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t get me wrong , i have other interests and ho ##bbies , outside of work . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m an avid runner , ad ##ore going out to restaurants , read like a mania ##c , and try and volunteer around the city . [SEP]
[CLS] i just lo ##ath ##e down ##time more than anything in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] down ##time means thinking time , re ##mini ##sc ##ing time , and i want as little of that in my life as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] without fail , my thoughts always turn to the past if they ' re not rooted in the present . [SEP]
[CLS] and that ' s never a pleasant experience for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i take the subway down to the lower east side , a neighborhood cho ##ck full of galleries , cool shops , and excellent cafes - not the mention some kick ##ass bars . [SEP]
[CLS] the bas ##tian offices are housed in a building that used to be a factory , once upon a time . [SEP]
[CLS] these days , it has the industrial feel that ' s so popular in the city while simultaneously being super high tech . [SEP]
[CLS] the best of both worlds . [SEP]
[CLS] i stop before the front door the office , taking a moment to check my reflection in the glass . [SEP]
[CLS] riley was right to suggest this top - it brings out the green in my hazel eyes nicely . [SEP]
[CLS] as i ring the buzz ##er , a strange feeling passes through me . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s almost like de ##ja vu , the feeling that this moment is significant , somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] clandestine . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe i ' m just anticipating the interview going well ? [SEP]
[CLS] whatever the case , there ' s no more time to ponder . [SEP]
[CLS] the door opens before me , and i step quickly into an old fashioned elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] the elevator doors part before me , and i step out into the high - ceiling ##ed office space . [SEP]
[CLS] a large communal desk stands at the center of the room , surrounded by a dozen hip twenty - something ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the walls are covered in white board , so that people can jo ##t down ideas whenever and wherever they occur . [SEP]
[CLS] my jaw falls open a little as i see a fully stocked bar standing in one corner of the main room . [SEP]
[CLS] the people running this place were n ' t kidding when they described it as ` ` off beat ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] i like it . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m supposed to be meeting with the founding partner and ceo of the agency , owen cooper . [SEP]
[CLS] but glancing around the spacious room , i do n ' t see a reception desk anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] silly me . [SEP]
[CLS] as if a place this cool would ever have something as square as a front desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] asks one of the people at the communal desk , pl ##uck ##ing out an ear ##bu ##d as the rest of the group types on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , that ' s me , ' ' i smile , hoping my nervous ##ness does n ' t show . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cooper is waiting for you in his office , ' ' she says , nodding toward a glass door off the main room . [SEP]
[CLS] calling the boss by his last name , huh ? [SEP]
[CLS] how unconventional . [SEP]
[CLS] another check in the plus column for this place . [SEP]
[CLS] i thank her and make my way toward the door . [SEP]
[CLS] before i can raise my hand to rap against the frost ##ed glass pan ##e , it swings open before me . [SEP]
[CLS] standing there is a man i recognize from the bas ##tian website as owen cooper himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s super young for a ceo , in his late 30 ' s or so . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s dressed in jeans , a sweater , and a friendly smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , as if we were old friends . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess being able to check out interview ##ees ' social media profiles makes everyone fast friends these days . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on in . [SEP]
[CLS] coffee ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' i reply , ` ` it ' s nice to meet you mr . - ' ' ` ` just ' cooper ' is fine , ' ' he cuts me off , pulling a shot from a fancy es ##press ##o machine sitting on a table against the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , thanks for coming in . [SEP]
[CLS] even if this is a bit of a formal ##ity . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , happily accepting the rich cup of es ##press ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your portfolio is excellent , ' ' he tells me , sitting down at his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` top notch . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew i wanted to hire you from the second i saw your work . [SEP]
[CLS] sorry . . . did i forget to mention that in my last email to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that you did , ' ' i say , sinking into a chair opposite him in mild disbelief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you saying . . . i already have the job ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do if you want it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles , ` ` you ' ll have to forgive my absent - minded ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] my brain is always hurrying onto the next task , so i sometimes skip over what ' s right in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] any ##how , yes ! [SEP]
[CLS] the job is yours for the taking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i absolutely want to take it , ' ' i grin , ` ` thanks mr . . . er , cooper . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , cl ##inking his coffee cup to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re in luck , too . [SEP]
[CLS] one of our managing editors from the european office is going to be lending me a hand here in new york for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s much less of a sc ##atter ##bra ##in than i am , so he ' s going to be the one showing you the ropes . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t remember if i told him that . . . ' ' ` ` that sounds great , ' ' i reply , sipping the fine es ##press ##o as i try to play it cool . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i stressed out all week for an interview that was actually a job offer ! [SEP]
[CLS] i guess with the fast - paced aspect of the tech world , hiring practices are a little quicker at places like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , what else can i tell you . . . ' ' mr . cooper continues , prop ##ping his sneak ##ered feet up on his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` salary is 60 ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] full benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] three weeks vacation . . . ' ' i stare at him , practically saliva ##ting . [SEP]
[CLS] i try to never think that something is too good to be true , as a rule . [SEP]
[CLS] but this whole situation is testing me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , what do you say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he presses jo ##vial ##ly , ` ` are you interested in the job , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m . . . very interested . [SEP]
[CLS] absolutely , ' ' i grin , ` ` this is my dream job , mr . . . cooper . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t tell you how i excited i am - ' ' ` ` yes , yes . [SEP]
[CLS] very good , ' ' cooper says , standing abruptly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , like i said , our brilliant managing editor is back from europe this afternoon , and he ' s going to be helping you get settled here at bas ##tian . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll trail him to meetings , sit in on brains ##torm ##ing sessions , all that good stuff . [SEP]
[CLS] but for today , just go home and relax . [SEP]
[CLS] take the friday to yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a fast - paced company , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to need all your stores of youthful energy come monday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds great to me , ' ' i say , standing as cooper opens the door for me . [SEP]
[CLS] we walk back out onto the main floor together , but i might as well be walking on a cloud . [SEP]
[CLS] this whole week , i ' ve been stress ##ing out about an interview that was actually an offer ! [SEP]
[CLS] what a screw ##y industry this is . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i ' m going to love it . [SEP]
[CLS] the other employees look up with interest as cooper leads me to the elevators . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' ll be so nice to work with people my age at a company on the cutting edge of creative innovation . [SEP]
[CLS] and i did n ' t even have to get grille ##d to score my place here ! [SEP]
[CLS] this day could not get any better . [SEP]
[CLS] though of course , that just means it could get much , much worse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you next week ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper says , as the elevator ding ##s to a stop at our floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks again for giving me this job , ' ' i tell him , giving his hand a quick shake . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise you , you wo n ' t be sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] beaming , i turn to the elevator as the doors sw ##ish open . [SEP]
[CLS] so blinded am i by my luminous good fortune that i stride into the elevator car without noticing the person trying to step out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] i reel backward , having collided with the human equivalent of a solid brick wall . [SEP]
[CLS] je ##ez , i thought this was a tech company , not a holding room for the iron man competition . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i actually bruised something on this guy ' s sharply cut muscles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry about that , ' ' a voice says from about a foot over my head , ` ` i hope i did n ' t hurt you , or . . . ' ' the voice is oddly familiar , though i ca n ' t place where i may have heard it before . [SEP]
[CLS] a commercial , maybe ? [SEP]
[CLS] or the radio ? [SEP]
[CLS] it trails off into distracted silence , and i look up for some more clues as to whose it might be . [SEP]
[CLS] the face looking down at me is utterly gorgeous - sculpted , symmetrical , and engaged . [SEP]
[CLS] a short crop of dark hair and a hint of stubble on the mans ' s razor - like jaw ##line perfect ##s his look . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a pair of dark rim ##med glasses perched on his straight nose , and for a moment the overhead light glare ##s against the lenses , ob ##scu ##ring his eyes from me . [SEP]
[CLS] but then he shifts , ever so slightly , and i can see his blue eyes clear as day . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize them at once , from the very core of me . [SEP]
[CLS] how could i not ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve only thought about them every day , at least once a day , for the past eight years . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson sawyer is standing right in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] and from the look in those all too familiar eyes , i know full well that he recognizes me , too . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah ! [SEP]
[CLS] here he is ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i hear cooper say , as if from very far away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , i thought you were n ' t due in for another couple of hours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was able to catch an earlier flight , ' ' emerson replies , his eyes still locked on me . [SEP]
[CLS] now that i ' ve placed that voice , every syllable he utter ##s twists my hearts ##tri ##ng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] his voice is lower , now . [SEP]
[CLS] richer . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s even taller than he was when we last met , at least by a couple of inches . [SEP]
[CLS] his body was muscular even when we were kids , but now every ounce of boy ##ish baby fat has melted from his frame , leaving nothing but a perfectly cut form in its wake . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s wearing perfectly - fitted dark wash jeans , a white cotton button down , and those designer black - rim ##med glasses . [SEP]
[CLS] no wonder i did n ' t recognize him at first - emerson ' s transformed from a gr ##ung ##y , angry teenage boy to a successful , intellectual tech genius . . . a tech genius who works for the same company i just landed a job at , who ' s supposed to show me the ropes of my new position , and who clearly was n ' t brief ##ed on the fact that i , abby rowan , was going to be his new protege . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i , uh , really have to run , ' ' i say , my voice faint . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have a . . . i ' ve got to . . . ' ' ` ` no worries . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll see you soon ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson here will teach you everything you need to know next week . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' i say , my eyes locking onto emerson ' s once more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok . well . [SEP]
[CLS] bye . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i skirt around emerson ' s tall , built form , all but dive into the elevator , and ja ##b the ` ` close door ' ' button with as much fe ##rocity as i can muster . [SEP]
[CLS] the second those doors snap shut again , i fall back against the elevator wall , my chest heaving , trying not to burst into tears . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like i ' m going to faint . [SEP]
[CLS] or be sick . [SEP]
[CLS] how could i have possibly not known that emerson works for bas ##tian these days ? [SEP]
[CLS] what are the chances that we ' d end up face - to - face like this , after all these years ? [SEP]
[CLS] and what the hell am i supposed to do now ? [SEP]
[CLS] i burst back out of the front doors , gulp ##ing down deep breaths as best i can . [SEP]
[CLS] all around me , new yorker ##s brush past , completely unaware that i ' m having the strange ##st , most di ##sor ##ient ##ing day of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] but , that ' s new york city for you - the best and worst place ever to have a panic attack . [SEP]
[CLS] struggling to regain a mod ##icum of composure , i straighten myself up and make to book it away from the bas ##tian offices . [SEP]
[CLS] i get about three steps , too , before i feel a strong hand catch mine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' i hear emerson say , ` ` abby , wait - ' ' ` ` what did you do , sc ##ur ##ry down the drain pipe ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , spinning around to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i prefer the stairs to the drain ##pipe , but thanks for the tip , ' ' he replies , looking at me with dazed wonder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you ' re here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry , ' ' i say quickly , stepping out of the busy sidewalk traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had no idea you work here , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] if i ' d known , i never would have applied . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says , taking a step toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t mean to show up here , una ##nn ##oun ##ced , and . . . you know . [SEP]
[CLS] crash your party , ' ' i ba ##bble , unable to keep my eyes on his face for long . [SEP]
[CLS] in the last eight years , his gorgeous ##ness has solid ##ified into sheer perfection . [SEP]
[CLS] i can only hope that time has treated me half as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise , i ' ll shoot cooper an email this weekend and tell him i ca n ' t accept the job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , i do n ' t want you to do that , ' ' emerson says , his brow fur ##row ##ing slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' d just listen to me for a minute , i could tell you that i ' m not mad about your being here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , surprised , ` ` but . . . why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because we ' re not ten years old , and this is n ' t a ' no girls allowed ' clubhouse , for one , ' ' emerson laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s . . . wonderful to see you , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t quite believe that it ' s happening , but . . . ' ' ` ` yeah , ' ' i laugh nervously , ` ` i certainly was n ' t expecting to run into you , well . . . ever . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how the hell have you been ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , laying a hand on my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] my skin sparks at his gentle , familiar touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` says you , ' ' i cho ##rt ##le in ##ele ##gan ##tly . [SEP]
[CLS] nice one , abby , i chi ##de myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , says me , ' ' emerson smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] we laps ##e into silence , staring at each other there on the sidewalk . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart is still hammering against my rib ##ca ##ge , my knees shake un ##con ##tro ##lla ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing emerson again is like a dream . [SEP]
[CLS] a very sexy dream . [SEP]
[CLS] but that said , i need to wake up , now . [SEP]
[CLS] the sooner the better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really should go , ' ' i insist , ed ##ging away , ` ` this is wild and everything , but i do n ' t think we should draw it out , you know ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll just leave you to your company , and find some other agencies to apply to , and - ' ' ` ` i just told you i do n ' t want you to turn down the job , ' ' emerson says , with just the slightest note of hardness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well . [SEP]
[CLS] i do want to turn it down , ' ' i shoot back , a bit annoyed at his tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he insists , crossing his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gee . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder , ' ' i reply , rolling my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` working side - by - side with my estranged ex - step ##bro ##ther slash . . . ' ' ` ` slash what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , his eyes hard on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just think it would be a terrible idea , ' ' i say flatly , ` ` but , hey , maybe i ' ll see you at a conference sometime , or - ' ' ` ` or over drinks , ' ' he cuts me off , the corner of his mouth twisting up into his signature , ro ##gui ##sh grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` drinks ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , raising an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what drinks are those ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the drinks we ' re going to have tomorrow night . [SEP]
[CLS] i know a great martini bar around here . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not as good as champagne in a motel room . . . ' ' my heart flip ##s over as he immediately brings up our fated night as lovers . [SEP]
[CLS] christ , he knows how to go right for the jug ##ular , does n ' t he ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` last time i checked , i had n ' t agreed to a drink , ' ' i remind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` true . [SEP]
[CLS] but you know what tomorrow is , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grins . [SEP]
[CLS] of course . [SEP]
[CLS] if saturday is my birthday , then tomorrow is his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want to spend your birthday . . . with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you have some leg ##gy , blonde super ##mo ##del to entertain ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` several , ' ' he says without missing a beat , ` ` but i ' d still rather hang out with you . [SEP]
[CLS] meet me at clinton and houston at eight . [SEP]
[CLS] wear something fancy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i know that there ' s no way he ' s going to let me off the hook , here . [SEP]
[CLS] the best i can do is say yes now and blow him off tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' i say crisp ##ly , extending my hand for him to shake , ` ` see you then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i swallow a gasp as he scoop ##s up my hand , draws it to his lips , and plants a kiss there . [SEP]
[CLS] someone turned into a gentlemen over the past eight years . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder how the hell that happened ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` looking forward to it , ' ' he smiles , holding onto my hand for longer than is necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and do n ' t you dare blow me off , ab . [SEP]
[CLS] it is my birthday , after all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i turn on my heel and hurry away , feeling all the blood in my body rush to my head . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a good thing i ' m familiar with this city by now , because i ca n ' t pay a lick of attention to anything all the way home . [SEP]
[CLS] in the blink of an eye i ' m staggering , dazed ##ly , back into my apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] i drop my purse onto the floor and flop onto the couch , staring straight ahead of me , un ##see ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] riley poke ##s her head out of her bedroom as she hears me enter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey ! [SEP]
[CLS] how ' d it go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i got the job , ' ' i tell her , my voice flat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s great , abby ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sq ##ue ##als , rushing out to join me on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] she stops short at my glazed expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby ? [SEP]
[CLS] is n ' t that great ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' i tell her , ` ` the job is great . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s perfect , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] amazing company , good salary , nice benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] and emerson sawyer happens to work there , too . [SEP]
[CLS] so there ' s that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley stares at me blankly . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t uttered emerson ' s name for years - well , not while sober , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you shit ##ting me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley hiss ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you saw emerson today ? [SEP]
[CLS] at your new company ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s going to be showing me the ropes , ' ' i tell her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or he would be , if i was going to take the job . [SEP]
[CLS] which i ' m obviously not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley ex ##claim ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why the hell would you not take it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you miss the part about emerson working there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as in my one - time brother , long - lost lover , walked out of my life forever and broke my heart into a million little pieces emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i caught that loud and clear , ' ' riley replies , sling ##ing an arm over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and there ' s no way you ' re passing up a dream job because he happens to be working at the same company . [SEP]
[CLS] if anything , his working there should be a per ##k ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what , ' ' i say , narrowing my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now you can re ##kind ##le your romance at last ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley ex ##claim ##s , ` ` it ' s ki ##sm ##et ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a train wreck waiting to happen , ' ' i correct her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in case you ' re forgetting , we did n ' t exactly end on great footing , emerson and i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ? [SEP]
[CLS] it was your parents who fucked everything up back then , ' ' riley presses , ` ` you could totally hit it off now that you ' re adults . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god . [SEP]
[CLS] did you give him a pep talk too or something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , shaking my head , ` ` he asked me out for a birthday drink about three seconds after we ' d run into each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley shriek ##s , pulling me to my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he asked you out ? ! [SEP]
[CLS] for when ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tomorrow , ' ' i tell her , wig ##gling out of her excited grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but do n ' t get your hopes up , it ' s not happening . [SEP]
[CLS] no way . [SEP]
[CLS] no how . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] all at once , riley snaps from gi ##ddy girlfriend to drill sergeant mode . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping into my path , she plants her hands on her hips and levels a glare at me that could cut through diamond . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abigail cecil ##y rowan , ' ' she begins . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for the past eight years , i have watched you pine away for this person , miss him beyond all comprehension , and refuse to get serious with anyone else because no one could ever take his place in your heart . [SEP]
[CLS] now , all of a sudden , fate has deposited him back into your lap , and you ' re seriously thinking of bail ##ing ? [SEP]
[CLS] that , my dear , just will not do . [SEP]
[CLS] i am not going to stand by while you flip off destiny and forever ruin your happily - ever - after chances because you ' re afraid of getting hurt again . [SEP]
[CLS] you will take this job . [SEP]
[CLS] you will let emerson back into your life . [SEP]
[CLS] and you will start tomorrow with a drink on his birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] do i make myself clear ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] looking into riley ' s furious face , i realize two things . [SEP]
[CLS] first , i ' ve been dying for someone to give me permission to see what happens from here with emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know how to give it to myself , of course , so thank god she ' s here . [SEP]
[CLS] second , even if i did n ' t want to see him ever again , she would make me anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] so , this is looking like a win - win . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you at least help me pick out something to wear ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' she sc ##offs , ` ` as if i ' d let you dress yourself for something this important . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and just like that , the matter is settled . [SEP]
[CLS] i let myself consider the possibility that maybe running into emerson today was n ' t a cruel joke from the universe , but a gift . [SEP]
[CLS] a super sexy , super loaded , super intelligent gift wrapped up in an incredible person that i ' ve loved since i was a kid , that is . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter thirteen after trying on twenty outfits , getting in at least three fights with riley , and nearly booking a plane ticket to canada rather than going through with this evening , i make it out the door to meet emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s asked me to meet him back on the lower east side , just a stone ' s throw from the bas ##tian offices . [SEP]
[CLS] i arrive a few minutes after eight and linger on the corner . [SEP]
[CLS] the birthday boy is nowhere in sight . [SEP]
[CLS] riley dressed me up in a deep red dress with a low - cut back and taste ##ful scoop neck ##line . [SEP]
[CLS] my blonde hair is arranged in a loose chi ##gnon , and the warm spring night does n ' t even require me to wear a jacket . [SEP]
[CLS] my stomach is a little flutter ##y , and i ' m still halfway convinced that i dreamed up seeing emerson the other day , but i ' m willing to stand here for another five seconds or so before i flee . [SEP]
[CLS] five . . . i count down in my head . [SEP]
[CLS] four . . . three . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel a hand on the small of my back and spin around sharply to find emerson standing before me . [SEP]
[CLS] and of course , he looks utterly fantastic . [SEP]
[CLS] a gray blaze ##r , light slacks , and trend ##y sued ##e loaf ##ers have him looking right at home in this neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' s lost the glasses , too - the better for me to og ##le his twenty - five - year - old - or rather , twenty - six - year - old face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you showed up , ' ' he grins , his eyes gleaming as he gives me a subtle once over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well , ' ' i shrug , burning up under his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t resist a martini , so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , i ' ll take it , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on . [SEP]
[CLS] the bar ' s right over here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i clutch onto my tiny black purse as emerson leads us over to an un ##rem ##ark ##able doorway embedded in the busy line of shops . [SEP]
[CLS] he rap ##s the door three times quickly , then twice at a slower pace . [SEP]
[CLS] i cock an eyebrow at his antics , but before i can say anything , the door swings open for us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s sort of a speak ##ea ##sy type place , ' ' he explains , nodding for me to follow him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a little bit exclusive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' s not kidding , either . [SEP]
[CLS] as i step into the dimly lit bar after him , i feel my jaw drop . [SEP]
[CLS] the place is elegant , imp ##ec ##cable , and super swan ##ky . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost laugh , remembering the little seafood shack we went to on his eighteenth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] how far we ' ve come ! [SEP]
[CLS] there are only a dozen or so people in here , all of them looking perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] this must be some elite , secret spot , known only to the rich and famous . [SEP]
[CLS] wait a minute . . . is emerson rich and famous now himself ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is my favorite table , ' ' he tells me , sinking into a plush corner booth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a favorite table here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , sinking down beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , ' ' he grins , ` ` and a favorite drink too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gap ##e as a martini appears on the table before emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] he wink ##s at the server , who clearly knows emerson ' s usual order . [SEP]
[CLS] the server , dressed in a finer suit than any of the men i ' ve dated , asks me for my order . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll . . . have what he ' s having , ' ' i say faintly . [SEP]
[CLS] the man nods and hu ##rries off to fix a drink for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i look around at the exquisite room , the beautiful patrons , and the spec ##ter from my past sitting across the table from me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i say at last , ` ` this , my friend , is officially bizarre . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess it sort of is , ' ' emerson laughs , more than happy to acknowledge the strange ##ness of our reunion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but , what good thing in life is n ' t a little surreal ? [SEP]
[CLS] i say we run with it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a perfect martini material ##izes before me . [SEP]
[CLS] i thank the server , pl ##uck up the cocktail , and hold up my glass in a toast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , happy birthday , emerson , ' ' i say , ` ` i hope you enjoy your one night of being older than me as much as you did when we were kids . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i think i will , ' ' he smiles , cl ##inking his glass to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a sip of my drink and freeze , sa ##vor ##ing the mind - blowing delicious ##ness of it . [SEP]
[CLS] this is top - shelf vodka . [SEP]
[CLS] the kind that ought to be kept in a safe . [SEP]
[CLS] a drink like this must cost a fortune . [SEP]
[CLS] and this is emerson ' s usual ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , i guess the past eight years have treated you well ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , stunned by the fine ##ness of the liquor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve done ok for myself , ' ' emerson nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , since there ' s no elegant se ##gue to be found here , start from the beginning , ' ' i tell him , ` ` how ' s your life been , tank ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##of , ' ' he cr ##inge ##s , ` ` using my old lacrosse nickname ? [SEP]
[CLS] harsh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , well . [SEP]
[CLS] old age has hardened me , ' ' i say , trying to keep a straight face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now spill ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ok , ' ' emerson says , taking a sip of his drink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , when we last saw each other , shit was going down in flames . [SEP]
[CLS] mom had just re ##la ##pse ##d , obviously , and i had just . . . well . . . ' ' ` ` kicked the shit out of grade - a do ##uche ##bag and gotten expelled , ' ' i finish his thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would be correct , ' ' emerson nods . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom and i picked up and left . [SEP]
[CLS] we landed at her sister ' s place in pennsylvania for a minute . [SEP]
[CLS] we got mom into rehab , and i found a little apartment outside of phil ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] nice town , you know . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t do much for the next year except visit my mom , take odd jobs to pay rent , and tool around on the computer . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think you knew this about me in high school , but i ' ve always been kind of a tech ne ##rd . [SEP]
[CLS] i became fascinated with programming , data , building things that other people could use . [SEP]
[CLS] i got my ge ##d , and told myself i ' d take a year to learn some more about programming before applying to college . [SEP]
[CLS] i took some courses in the city , and found out that i was pretty damn good at the whole thing . [SEP]
[CLS] the app cr ##az ##e was only just about to take off as i put together my first real project . [SEP]
[CLS] with a little bit of luck , and a whole lot of venture capital backing , the thing took off . [SEP]
[CLS] i sold my app , made a ton . [SEP]
[CLS] overnight , everything was different . [SEP]
[CLS] so instead of going to college , i just kept building , and thinking , and meeting new people . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , i ran into cooper , and he all but handed the european offices of bas ##tian to me on a silver platt ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been there for a couple of years , and it ' s been amazing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re telling me that you went from bad boy jock to tech millionaire ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , staring at him across the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` close , ' ' he says , unable to contain his proud but modest smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i went from bad boy jock to tech billionaire . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes go wide as i try to comprehend the thing he ' s just told me . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s smile fades as i sit silently beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , was that a total asshole move ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , frowning , ` ` i do n ' t know what i was thinking , just bringing that up - ' ' ` ` no , emerson , ' ' i say quickly , reaching for his hand before i can stop myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s amazing . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just so , so proud of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in unison , we glance down at our now - clasped hands on the table . [SEP]
[CLS] bash ##ful as ever , i lift my fingers away . [SEP]
[CLS] my skin tingle ##s where it glanced against his . [SEP]
[CLS] as if i did n ' t have enough reason to be nervous around him before , now it turns out that he ' s not only my long - lost first love , but also a goddamn billionaire ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is shaping up to be quite a week , i ' ll tell you . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . . . what about you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , breaking the pointed silence , ` ` how did things play out for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' i begin , taking a nice big sip of my drink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from the point of our parents ' disastrous one - day marriage , my dad totally wiped out . [SEP]
[CLS] re ##la ##pse ##d harder than ever . [SEP]
[CLS] really just never recovered . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents took me in until high school was over , and then i moved to the city to study at the new school with riley . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve been living together ever since , in this great place my grandparents own . . . u ##gh . [SEP]
[CLS] sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i sound like such a mo ##och . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , not at all , ' ' emerson assure ##s me , ` ` you ' ve got to use the resources you have , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll take that , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else . . . i studied graphic design and digital media , got my masters , and vo ##ila ! [SEP]
[CLS] here i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` design , huh ? [SEP]
[CLS] so you still get to be an artist , ' ' he says , his eyes resting warmly on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] i smile , touched that he ' s remembered my childhood passion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in a way , yes , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i guess you ' ll be seeing a lot more of my work soon , what with your kind of being my boss and all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m your colleague , not your boss , ' ' emerson insists . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh - huh . [SEP]
[CLS] sure , ' ' i tease , ` ` whatever you say , boss . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` careful , lack ##ey , ' ' he shoots back , jumping on my joke , ` ` or i ' ll have to dock your pay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##oh , i ' m shaking in my panties , ' ' i s ##nick ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] my cheeks flame red as i realize that it ' s taken me all of five minutes to bring my panties into the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , ' ' emerson chuckles , seeing my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t courtney hai ##nes ' house party . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not go ##n na make you hand them over or anything . [SEP]
[CLS] unless you really want to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` duly noted , ' ' i tell him , all but sw ##ig ##ging my martini . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear she ' s on broadway now , ' ' emerson goes on , glancing down at his drink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really , ' ' i say , feeling an old tri ##ll of jealousy run through me as i remember the redhead ##ed beauty who s ##na ##gged emerson ' s attention all those years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] almost won a tony and everything , ' ' emerson says , pl ##uck ##ing up his olive and popping it into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i should call her up and see how she ' s doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m about to say something polite and change the subject , until i see the look in emerson ' s gorgeous blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you bait ##ing me , sawyer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it working , rowan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he wink ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re terrible , ' ' i inform him , relieved that he was n ' t serious about courtney . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s true , ' ' he sighs dramatically , ` ` some things never change . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , there surely is n ' t room for courtney in your hare ##m , ' ' i go on , ` ` with your whole gorgeous bad boy billionaire thing , you ' ve probably got a girlfriend for every day of the week . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , ' ' emerson replies , ` ` but thanks for calling me gorgeous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like you do n ' t know , ' ' i shoot back , ` ` so then , just the one girlfriend for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m afraid not , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fiancee ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , with mounting dread , ` ` wife ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , there is ro ##xie . . . ' ' he says , ` ` she ' s very important to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ro ##xie ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , ` ` you ' re with a woman named ro ##xie ? [SEP]
[CLS] who the hell - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s my west highland terri ##er , ' ' he cuts me off with a smirk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but good to see you ' re still protective of me , ab . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not - i just - ' ' i sp ##utter , ` ` i ' m just curious , is all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that makes two of us , ' ' he replies , ` ` i ' m expecting a report on your love life , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or lack thereof , you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask dr ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just finished gr ##ad school . [SEP]
[CLS] that means my most significant romantic relationship at the moment is with my pizza delivery man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who is he ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll throttle him , ' ' emerson says , raising his fists like a cartoon le ##pre ##cha ##un . [SEP]
[CLS] but the memory of the beat down he gave tucker all those years ago is too fresh for that particular joke to be funny . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time these evening , the silence between us grows tense . [SEP]
[CLS] despite our relatively bree ##zy reunion so far , there ' s a lot of ugly , buried emotions hanging between us . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve spent a good part of the last eight years being furious with emerson for disappearing on me when i needed him . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been hurt , angry , and more than anything , just terribly sad to have lost him . [SEP]
[CLS] all that feeling ca n ' t just eva ##por ##ate because he ' s res ##ur ##face ##d with a shit ton of money and nice ##r biceps than ever before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what you ' re thinking , ' ' he says with quiet firm ##ness , leaning toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honestly ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , ` ` i ' m thinking about all the imaginary fights i ' ve had with you these past few years . [SEP]
[CLS] all the things i ' d dream of saying to you , if we ever ran into each other again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks intently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t want me to tell you , ' ' i mutter , ` ` your eyebrows might get sing ##ed off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that bad , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that bad , ' ' i assure him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i had plenty of imaginary conversations with you , too , ' ' he tells me , moving closer by just an inch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want to know how most of them went ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure - ' ' ` ` usually , they rev ##olved around me ap ##olo ##gizing for vanishing into thin air on you , ' ' he cuts me off , ` ` and for leaving you to deal with the fallout on your own . [SEP]
[CLS] and hey , now that you ' re actually sitting here with me , i can tell you - i ' m sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think sorry can begin to fix it , ' ' i whisper , staring down at my drink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you left , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] left me alone in that house , with my dad , after the way he treated us . [SEP]
[CLS] he could have hurt me , if riley had n ' t shown up to get me . [SEP]
[CLS] did you even care ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course i cared , ' ' he said fiercely , ` ` but try to imagine being me in that moment . [SEP]
[CLS] having my mother bring the whole family crashing down all on her own . . . it was humiliating . [SEP]
[CLS] i felt like absolute sc ##um for being my parents ' kid . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t even look at you , i was so ashamed of who i was . [SEP]
[CLS] and so furious that i could n ' t do anything to help or protect you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that why you nearly killed tucker ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess it is , ' ' emerson allows , shaking his head , ` ` i was n ' t really thinking about it much at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] to be honest , abby , i do n ' t lose much sleep over what i did to him . [SEP]
[CLS] in my mind , that ' s what he had coming from the moment he . . . anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] i had to disappear , ab . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t stand the idea of you being as ashamed of me as i was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was never ashamed of you , ' ' i burst out , ` ` never once , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] that was just some crazy idea you cooked up in your own damn mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i never gave a shit about our families ' money and standing . [SEP]
[CLS] you know that . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least you should have known . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re right , ' ' emerson murmurs , reaching for my hand , ` ` i should have . [SEP]
[CLS] and for that , again , i am truly sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] but do n ' t you think for a second that i would n ' t have come running back if you ' d ever needed me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how would you have known if i did ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , exasperated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i followed you , ' ' he says , ` ` online , i mean . [SEP]
[CLS] your social media presence was pretty remarkably un ##pro ##tec ##ted when you were younger . [SEP]
[CLS] for a while , i scope ##d you out on facebook , myspace , checked in to see how you were doing . [SEP]
[CLS] but once you got to college , and it seemed like your whole life was just opening up in front of you . . . i knew you ' d be ok . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew you did n ' t need me anymore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not true , ' ' i whisper , my eyes stinging with unexpected tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did need you , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] so much . . . ' ' ` ` i needed you too , ' ' he replies , rubbing his thumb against my hand , ` ` but we could n ' t be in each others ' lives then . [SEP]
[CLS] not with everything that had happened . [SEP]
[CLS] but look . [SEP]
[CLS] we seem to have found a way back in again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so it would seem , ' ' i smile softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve spent the past eight years wondering what i would say to you , if i ever saw you again , ' ' emerson murmurs , his voice dipping low . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that dip , know what it means . [SEP]
[CLS] between that and the gleam in his eye , his intentions are pretty clear . [SEP]
[CLS] and despite every ounce of logic i possess , i can feel myself responding to his lead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want to say , then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , my own voice soft and husky . [SEP]
[CLS] my heart feels like a kick drum as emerson moves closer to me . [SEP]
[CLS] our sides brush against each other as he moves his hand up my arm , pulling me in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it turns out , i do n ' t want to say anything , ' ' he says , his words gravel ##ly and ardent . [SEP]
[CLS] his lips move ever closer to mine , and i can feel my mouth lifting to his , as if of its own accord . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson goes on , his mouth nearly on mine , ` ` i ' d rather show you . . . ' ' ` ` hey emerson ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] someone says from across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i jerk away from emerson as a trio of familiar faces make their way across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize the two men and woman as some of the young people manning the communal desk at bas ##tian . [SEP]
[CLS] my new cow ##or ##kers , as it were . [SEP]
[CLS] and they ' ve just happened upon me about to suck face with my superior . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at emerson , my mind scrambling to figure out what my heart wants . [SEP]
[CLS] he just looks back at me with frustrated desire , forcing a smile as his colleagues come over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s it going , bradley ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , as the st ##yl ##ish three ##some comes to a stop before us , ` ` tyler , emily - do you guys all know abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the new recruit , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the man called bradley asks . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s doing the whole trend ##y - pseudo - rustic look , full beard and all . [SEP]
[CLS] and from the barely - concealed amusement on his face , i know he ' s hip to what was about to happen between me and emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] they all are . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s me , ' ' i say faintly . [SEP]
[CLS] looking up at them , then across the table at emerson , i feel like we ' re back in our hometown diner - that night emerson ' s lax bros nearly gave me a heart attack . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the panic beginning to rise inside of me at the mere thought of it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you guys mind if we join you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] asks emily , the chi ##c hips ##ter with bright violet hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was actually just going to head out , ' ' i say , grabbing my purse and rising quickly to my feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have to catch a drink with you guys some other time ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' emerson says , his smile tightening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to go already - ' ' ` ` i really do , ' ' i shoot back firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about your drink ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he presses , as our cow ##or ##kers drink in the tense drama . [SEP]
[CLS] with my eyes locked on emerson , i raise my martini glass and knock back the rest , chu ##gging the insane ##ly expensive and delicious liquor just to spite him . [SEP]
[CLS] he holds my gaze , his expression harden ##ing into that un ##rea ##dable mask i know so well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you guys later , ' ' i say to emerson and our three fl ##ab ##berg ##ast ##ed cow ##or ##kers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a lovely evening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , i turn on my heel and dash out of the bar . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve barely made it back onto the busy street before the tears come . [SEP]
[CLS] i should have known that this - being alone with emerson - would be too much for me all at once . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s too much history there , too much pain , for some bree ##zy birthday drinks to be possible . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry back toward the subway , cursing myself for being such a damn idiot . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d love to not make this running - after - you thing a habit , ' ' i hear emerson ' s ter ##se voice say from over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s an easy fix for that , ' ' i snap back , ` ` stop running after me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i draw myself up short as emerson places his staggering , perfect body in my path . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t mean to freak you out , ' ' he tells me , ` ` i should n ' t have pushed you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . i ca n ' t pretend that i do n ' t still want you , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] that i do n ' t still care - ' ' ` ` god ##dam ##mit emerson , ' ' i ex ##claim , wrapping my arms around my waist , ` ` have n ' t you ever heard of subtle ##ty ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tried it once . [SEP]
[CLS] not a fan , ' ' he shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t going to work , ' ' i tell him , shaking my head , ` ` we ca n ' t just pick up right where we left off after that night at the beach . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he insists , taking my hands in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you took a sl ##edge ##hammer to my heart , you asshole ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , tearing away from his grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve loved you for the better part of a decade , but we ' re not kids anymore , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] we ca n ' t just throw caution to the wind , you live in europe , and - ' ' ` ` we ' re twenty - five ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughs , inc ##red ##ulously , ` ` we can do whatever we like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re twenty - six , ' ' i remind him , ` ` and i ' ve spent the last eight years picking up the pieces of my life on my own . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not about to let you shatter them again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that what you think i ' d do , if you gave me another chance ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his voice hard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' i reply , feeling my bottom lip begin to tremble , ` ` i know it ' s what you ' d do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes flash with wounded sorrow as i barrel past him . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , he lets me go . [SEP]
[CLS] i charge away , back up to my haven on the upper west side , struggling to hold it together . [SEP]
[CLS] i manage to make it all the way home before my own grief spill ##s over . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time i glance at my bedside clock , i see that it ' s after midnight . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s officially my own twenty - sixth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] and would you look at that ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m lying here alone , miserable as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see , this is why i hate birthday ##s , ' ' i mutter to myself , surrender ##ing to sleep at last . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fourteen it seems that emerson has taken the hint . [SEP]
[CLS] there are n ' t a thousand voice ##mail ##s and texts waiting on my phone in the morning , and he does n ' t appear out of thin air all day during my birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] riley , unable to contain herself , wakes me up with a wonderful breakfast spread to start the day off right . [SEP]
[CLS] one look at my face and she does n ' t press for details about the night before . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a saint , that woman . [SEP]
[CLS] we take our time waking up , head out for a hot yoga class , and take a nice long walk along the hudson river together . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , i fill her in on what went down at drinks last night . [SEP]
[CLS] she listen ##s pens ##ively as i give her the scoop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you may not want to hear this , ' ' she begins , glancing at me as we stroll by the water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that probably means i need to hear it though , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh , ` ` go ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] shoot . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it sounds like you ' re scared by how much you still care about him , ' ' riley says , laying a hand on my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re terrified of history repeating itself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do still care about him , ' ' i admit , surprised by the knot in my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never stopped caring about him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' riley smiles sadly , ` ` i ' ve been with you these last eight years since he disappeared from your life . [SEP]
[CLS] but abby . . . you have to remember that there ' s one huge difference between then and now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his pe ##cs ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i offer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should see them , ri - ' ' ` ` not what i meant , ' ' she laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was going to say , you were kids when everything went wrong before . [SEP]
[CLS] you had to answer to your horrible , selfish parents . [SEP]
[CLS] now , you have no one to answer to but yourselves . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe that ' s what ' s freaking me out , ' ' i say softly , ` ` there ' s no one to blame if things go wrong again . [SEP]
[CLS] if we mess it up this time . . . it ' s because we ' re not actually right for each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` being a grown ##up sucks , do n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley laughs , shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you know what else sucks ? [SEP]
[CLS] sq ##uan ##der ##ing a wonderful relationship with someone you ' re nuts about , just because you ' re scared . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can you always know the right thing to say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask her , amazed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just a genius , ' ' she sighs , as we turn toward home , ` ` n ##b ##d . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents are swinging by the apartment to check up on the place and have drinks before we go out to dinner , but that wo n ' t be until early this evening . [SEP]
[CLS] i have the whole lazy late afternoon to myself . [SEP]
[CLS] which would be fine and dan ##dy if i could do anything but lay around thinking about emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to check in with him about last night and explain my freak out . [SEP]
[CLS] but every time i reach for my cell , something stops me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , miss 26 - year - old , ' ' i mutter stern ##ly , staring down at my phone , ` ` put on your big girl panties and give him a - ' ' i let out a very und ##ign ##ified ye ##lp as the phone begins to vi ##brate in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] dropping the device onto my bed in surprise , i peer down at it and feel my stomach flip . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a text on my screen that simply reads : hey abby , it ' s emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab up the phone and text back before i lose my nerve . [SEP]
[CLS] me : hey , i was just about to call you . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] him : so do i . [SEP]
[CLS] how do you feel about doing it in person ? [SEP]
[CLS] me : oh , i do n ' t think i have time to come all the way back downtown before my plans tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] him : you do n ' t have to come downtown . [SEP]
[CLS] me : no ? [SEP]
[CLS] i jump a foot in the air as my apartment buzz ##er rings . [SEP]
[CLS] another text arrives in its wake : him : nope . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you expecting a package ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley calls from the living room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ri , it ' s him ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp , yanking open my bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson is here ? [SEP]
[CLS] at our apartment ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she breathe ##s excitedly , ` ` well , what are you waiting for ? [SEP]
[CLS] buzz him up ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . [SEP]
[CLS] i . [SEP]
[CLS] what if - ' ' i st ##am ##mer , biting my lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , for christ ' s sake , ' ' riley groans . [SEP]
[CLS] she marches across the room and pushes the ` ` door ' ' button on the buzz ##er , granting emerson access to our building . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' she grins , marching toward her room , ` ` i ' ll be in my bo ##ud ##oir . [SEP]
[CLS] call if you need any further intervention , yeah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' i say weakly , paralyzed as i stare at the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] at least i made an effort to look present ##able today . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve got my favorite pair of skinny jeans on , a sl ##ou ##chy white tee with a charcoal card ##igan , and some eclectic pieces of jewelry i ' ve picked up at the brooklyn flea market . [SEP]
[CLS] my blonde hair hangs in loose , easy waves , and my favorite red matt ##e lipstick finishes off the look . [SEP]
[CLS] still , even knowing that i look my millennia ##l - chi ##c best , my heart nearly bursts out of my chest as i hear a knock on the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s here . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` answer it or i will ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley tri ##lls from the other room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` u ##gh . [SEP]
[CLS] fine , ' ' i mutter , going to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` quit crack ##in ' the whip , would you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that about whip ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson grins , as i swing the door open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' i st ##am ##mer , taken aback by his perfect appearance yet again . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s wearing a black v - neck and gray jeans , and the sm ##atter ##ing of stubble on his jaw is as sexy as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] the glasses are nowhere to be seen , which means his vibrant blue eyes are on full , gorgeous display . [SEP]
[CLS] the tee shirt cuts off just above his bulging , perfect biceps . [SEP]
[CLS] i spot a few new tattoos on his arms , too . [SEP]
[CLS] guess there ' s still a bad boy mixed in with that tech billionaire . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no literal whip ##s on hand , sorry to di ##sa ##pp ##oint you , ' ' i laugh , moving aside to let him in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a shame , ' ' he sighs , taking a look around the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m suddenly self - conscious of the ornate , elegant decor . [SEP]
[CLS] i know emerson has money now and everything , but the decade ##nce of my grandparents ' apartment still has me feeling very un ##co ##ol . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , this place is a bit much , ' ' i say nervously , watching his blue eyes ro ##ve around the space . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but , you know , it ' s my grandparents ' . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re not exactly hip to the whole minimal ##ism , eco - friendly movement . [SEP]
[CLS] actually , they ' re stopping by soon for a little birthday celebration . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` frank and jillian ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , laying on a parody of his most proper , upper - class voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a delight ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] not my idea of a good time , but they ' re family . [SEP]
[CLS] and they ' ve also been supporting me my entire life . [SEP]
[CLS] so i can handle a bit of wasp ##y tension once in a while , ' ' i reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be sure to get out of here before they show up , ' ' emerson says , ` ` would n ' t want anyone to have a heart attack on your birthday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure they ' d be happy to see you , ' ' i offer . [SEP]
[CLS] we look at each other for a moment before bust ##ing out laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson is the last person on the planet my grandparents would want to run into , billionaire or no . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i doubt they ' d be impressed by something as ga ##uche as ' new money ' , ' ' emerson cho ##rt ##les , settling down on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , how dare you be successful in this economy , young man , ' ' i reply , doing my best frank rowan impression as i settle down beside emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] we sit next to each other and laps ##e into silence . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess this is the moment where we ' re supposed to address what went down last night , but it ' s always hard to start . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope you do n ' t mind my swinging by , ' ' emerson begins , ` ` i know it ' s an un ##in ##vite ##d visit , but i wanted to talk to you before we got back into the office on monday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' i laugh , ` ` yeah , that might have been awkward . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i also did n ' t want to let the day pass without wishing you a happy birthday , ' ' he goes on , training those gorgeous eyes on me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' i breathe , very aware of the slender space between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` has it been a good one so far ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it just got a lot better , to tell you the truth , ' ' i reply , my voice low and quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel that panicked resistance rising in me the more my want of him grows , but i force myself to get through it . [SEP]
[CLS] deal with it . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t let my own fears fuck this moment up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear it , ' ' emerson smiles , ` ` and i hope this is n ' t too forward , but i also wanted to make sure to give you your birthday present before the day was out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , turning to face him on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean , present ? [SEP]
[CLS] we only just ran into each other two days ago . [SEP]
[CLS] how did you already - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s just say i ' ve been holding onto it for a while , ' ' he says , reaching into the pocket of his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` about eight years , as a matter of fact . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the world grind ##s to a halt around me as he produces a simple black ring box . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at the tiny gift , my mind and heart making the obvious leap . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson watches my jaw hit the floor and rushes to assure me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t worry . [SEP]
[CLS] i would n ' t do that to you , ' ' he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right , ' ' i breathe , ` ` of course . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he goes to hand me the box , but at the last second holds it up over his head , out of my reach . [SEP]
[CLS] his favorite old joke from when we were kids . [SEP]
[CLS] and given that he ' s got even more height on me now , the joke holds . [SEP]
[CLS] i give him a playful shove , and he finally hands the box to me . [SEP]
[CLS] my hands tremble as i force a pl ##ac ##id smile onto my face and open the ring box . [SEP]
[CLS] am i relieved that he did n ' t just whip out an engagement ring , or was some ridiculous little corner of my mind hoping that he was going to ? [SEP]
[CLS] whatever the case may be , the question fades out of my mind as i lift the lid of the box and see what ' s inside . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a delicate silver ring , set with one gleaming freshwater pearl . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i ' ve seen this ring before . [SEP]
[CLS] but where ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when we were at the beach for our birthday ##s , all those years ago , ' ' emerson says , watching me intently , ` ` we stopped at that one shop you liked so much in town , with all those hand ##made crafts and things . [SEP]
[CLS] you stared at this ring for a good five minutes , just admiring it . [SEP]
[CLS] you did n ' t say anything , of course , but i knew you loved it . [SEP]
[CLS] i waited until you were trying things on in the dressing room and bought it for you . [SEP]
[CLS] for your eighteenth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] but with everything that actually ended up happening that day . . . i never got a chance to give it to you . [SEP]
[CLS] well . [SEP]
[CLS] until now , that is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve . . . held onto this the whole time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper , looking up at him in wonder , ` ` you ' ve had this ring for eight years , emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess some part of me always hoped i ' d have the chance to give it to you someday , ' ' he says softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and would you look at that ? [SEP]
[CLS] here you are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here i am , ' ' i smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never forgot about you , abby , ' ' he says , resting a hand on mine , ` ` not for a second . [SEP]
[CLS] through every other relationship , and date , and fling , i always had you at the back of my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] no one ever measured up to you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not blaming you for my lack of committed relationships , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just . . . i never wanted to settle down with anyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] because the person i really cared about was still out there . [SEP]
[CLS] only , i ' d already met and lost her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t lose me , ' ' i whisper , lac ##ing my fingers through his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we just . . . mis ##placed each other for a while . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll take that , ' ' he smiles , inch ##ing toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] i force myself to take a deep breath as we move closer , and closer . [SEP]
[CLS] the heat and near ##ness of him are making my head spin , and that ' s not all . [SEP]
[CLS] i clench my thighs together , acute ##ly aware of the throbbing need building between my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] just being close to him , alone in this room , is enough to turn me on . [SEP]
[CLS] it dawn ##s on me , for the first time , that i do n ' t have say ` ` no ' ' in this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing is stopping me from being with emerson the way i want to be . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , i ' ve missed you , ' ' emerson murmurs fiercely , catching my face in hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] you know how i feel about showing and telling , sawyer , ' ' i whisper , my voice low and ras ##ping with want . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that i do , ' ' he grins , those blue eyes mere inches from mine . [SEP]
[CLS] and with that , he tugs me tightly against him and brings his mouth to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i bend my body to his , opening myself without a second thought . [SEP]
[CLS] the familiar taste of him , still the same after all these years , sets the syn ##ap ##ses of my brain spark ##ing , dr ##edging up a million memories . [SEP]
[CLS] my every barrier and defense goes crumbling down as i run my fingers through his now - crop ##ped brown hair . [SEP]
[CLS] i press my body flush against his as i feel his tongue sweep against mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses me swiftly , ferocious ##ly , and i match his intensity at every stroke . [SEP]
[CLS] now that we ' ve given ourselves the permission to touch and be touched by each other , there ' s no stopping us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no one ' s ever made me feel the way you do , ' ' i gasp , as emerson pulls me onto his lap , kissing down along my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just know you , abby , ' ' he growls , his hands running down the length of my body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my god , you feel exactly the same . [SEP]
[CLS] the way your body moves , the way you respond to me . . . ' ' ` ` i ' ve missed these hands , ' ' i groan softly , as emerson brushes his fingers against my tender inner thigh , runs his hands over the rise of my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' ve missed you , ' ' he smiles devil ##ishly , catching my lips in his once more . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t keep my hips from grinding against his as i st ##rad ##dle him on the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] our tongues glide against each other , twisting and caressing like i wish our limbs could , right this second . [SEP]
[CLS] my breath comes hard and fast as that throbbing between my legs grows more intense - more intent on getting what it wants . [SEP]
[CLS] i can already feel myself getting wet for him as he pulls me flush against him - lets me feel the tell ##tale rise in his jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no one ' s ever known how to turn me on like you do , either , ' ' he says , his fierce blue eyes hard on my face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe we ' ve gone so long without this , ' ' i breathe , taking his gorgeous , sculpted face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we do n ' t have to wait any longer , ' ' he replies , turning his face to lay a kiss against my palm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not if you do n ' t want to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want to , ' ' i whisper , letting my sex rub ever - so - lightly against his stiff cock . [SEP]
[CLS] the feel of him pressing hard against me brings a sudden , un ##tem ##per ##ed cry to my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] i just ca n ' t help myself as i feel the staggering bulk of him brush against my aching clit , even through layers of clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] the second my moan escapes into the air , my eyes go wide . [SEP]
[CLS] i clasp my hands over my mouth , but it ' s too late . [SEP]
[CLS] riley ' s bedroom door flies open , and i scramble off of emerson ' s lap as she appears in the doorway in full action mode . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m surprised she is n ' t carrying a fry ##ing pan or something . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demands , taking in the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , sure ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh dem ##ented ##ly , leaping off of the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re fine ! [SEP]
[CLS] sorry ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my best friend sees emerson ' s fl ##ab ##berg ##ast ##ed , frustrated expression , not to mention the to ##us ##led state of my hair and clothes , and puts two and two together . [SEP]
[CLS] her game face is replaced by a knowing grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i heard you scream , ' ' she says , fei ##gni ##ng innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t mean to interrupt anything , or - ' ' ` ` it ' s ok , ' ' i insist , shooting her a look that says , please shut the fuck up , dude . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that emerson sawyer i see sitting on our couch ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she goes on , crossing her arms with an amused smile on her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that it is , ' ' emerson says , grinning game ##ly back at her as he stands . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s rolling with the interruption , just like that night when our post - dr . z ##hi ##va ##go make - out session was interrupted by our parents - and the announcement of their doomed engagement . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s always been quick on his feet , my emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] my emerson ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ask myself , what ' s this about my emerson , abby ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` man , it ' s been forever ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley ex ##claim ##s , ` ` you look great , man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] you too , ' ' he replies , shoving his hands into his pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] the flush fades from his chi ##sel ##ed face . [SEP]
[CLS] good . [SEP]
[CLS] at least one of us is composed . [SEP]
[CLS] i probably look like a deer caught in the headlights . [SEP]
[CLS] who also happens to be in heat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , did you offer our guest a drink ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] no , ' ' i mum ##ble bash ##fully , ` ` i did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure , if you guys are having something , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` vodka tonic ##s good for everyone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks , making her way over to our home bar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` make mine a double , ' ' i mutter , trading glances with emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] he strides my way and leans close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` later , ' ' he whispers in my ear , ` ` just you wait . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you trying to make me faint or something , sawyer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i whisper back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not just yet , ' ' he wink ##s , and goes to join riley at the bar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here we go , ' ' she says , passing out the three cocktail ##s and raising her glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to old friends , all grown up and kicking ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll drink to that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hell yeah , ' ' i smile , cl ##inking my glass to theirs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and to your birthday , of course ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley adds . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] happy birthday , abby , ' ' emerson says warmly , taking a sip of his drink . [SEP]
[CLS] my body may still be reeling with having had a moment of contact with emerson , but the mere knowledge that things between us are back on track is enough to keep me gi ##ddy . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i ' m here with my best friend and long - lost lover . . . who i ' ve been carrying a torch for almost the entire past decade , despite our asshole parents ' one - day marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] happy birthday to me , indeed . [SEP]
[CLS] the three of us settle down in the living room , riley and emerson catching each other up on their lives and careers . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t help but be wildly proud of these two . [SEP]
[CLS] neither one of them had any idea what they wanted to do with their futures as high school seniors , but now that they ' ve followed their passions , they ' ve made incredible lives for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , if anyone ' s slack ##ing on the whole bright shiny future thing , it ' s me . [SEP]
[CLS] but maybe now that i ' ve got my job at bas ##tian , things will start to take off for me , too . [SEP]
[CLS] at least , i hope that ' s the case . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t suppose you keep in touch with anyone from high school , emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks , whipping us up a second round . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no one except courtney hai ##nes , ' ' i tease , nu ##d ##ging him . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re co ##zie ##d up on the couch next to each other , casual as can be . [SEP]
[CLS] amazing how comfortable it is to be near him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t keep in touch with courtney hai ##nes , ' ' emerson laughs , nu ##d ##ging me back , ` ` or anyone , for that matter . [SEP]
[CLS] i consider myself a bit of a hometown ex ##pa ##t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that make three of us , ' ' riley replies , fur ##nish ##ing us with fresh cocktail ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in fact , if i had n ' t run into you two again , i doubt i ' d ever have run into a familiar face from those glory days , ' ' emerson goes on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not even family ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks without thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot her a look , and she realizes her mistake at once , but it ' s too late now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , mom ' s still more or less living in the rehab revolving door , ' ' emerson says , not meeting anyone ' s gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and my dad . . . he actually passed away , a few years after i left connecticut with my mom . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] this is news to me , and i ca n ' t help but wrap my arm supportive ##ly around emerson ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] as if he needed any more pain to carry around on those broad shoulders of his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , ' ' i murmur , ` ` i know how hard that is , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i actually thought about calling you , when it happened , ' ' he laughs shortly , ` ` i knew you ' d gone through the same thing . [SEP]
[CLS] could n ' t think of anyone else i ' d want to talk to more . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could have , you know , ' ' i say softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' emerson sighs , shaking off the sadness of his father ' s passing , ` ` you ' re here now , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] guess we ' ve just got some more catching up to do . [SEP]
[CLS] all of us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we all return to our drinks as the conversation resume ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t eaten a ton today , so my drinks are really doing a number on me already . [SEP]
[CLS] just as i start wondering whether we should order a huge pizza to so ##ak up some of this vodka , i remember what tonight actually has in store for me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shit . [SEP]
[CLS] what time is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , standing up suddenly from the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just about seven , ' ' emerson says , glancing at his watch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why , what - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh god , ' ' riley groans , looking up at me , ` ` your grandparents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not dressed . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have time . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re going to be here any second , ' ' i cry , setting down my empty martini glass and setting off toward my bedroom to get changed . [SEP]
[CLS] but the second i spin around on my heel , i hear the buzz ##er ring out . [SEP]
[CLS] frank and jillian rowan have arrived for the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , shit , ' ' emerson laughs darkly , ` ` it ' s a family reunion ! [SEP]
[CLS] this should be fun . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , abby , ' ' riley says , anticipating my panic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a grown woman . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s none of their business who you spend your time with . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` try telling them that , ' ' i mutter , anxiously buzzing them up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` look , i ' m sure it will be fine , ' ' emerson sighs , starting to gather his things , ` ` if nothing else , they ' ve got that whole s ##nob ##by , fake - polite thing going on . [SEP]
[CLS] so it ' s not like they ' ll start anything with me . [SEP]
[CLS] rich people do n ' t do confrontation . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not proper . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m surprised to feel a twin ##ge of annoyance at emerson ' s general ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents are n ' t perfect , but they ' re the only family i have these days . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re the only people who have supported me through my life , even if that support has been more financial than emotional . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not ok with emerson slamming them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are n ' t you a rich person now , too ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask curt ##ly , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson raises an eyebrow , taken aback by my tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure . [SEP]
[CLS] but i earned my money , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have n ' t just been inherit ##ing my advantages and coast ##ing along . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like i ' m doing , you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] now i ' m really getting pissed off . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought that he , of all people , would n ' t be judgment ##al about something like money . [SEP]
[CLS] but i guess maybe i was wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe having money has changed him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know i ' m not talking about you , ' ' he says , actually shocked by my reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , you do n ' t coast . [SEP]
[CLS] you work your ass off , you ' re great at what you do - ' ' ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] when you spend your whole life inherit ##ing your advantages , you have a lot of time to devote to your interests , ' ' i say dr ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t put words in my mouth , ' ' emerson says stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t sp ##out orders at me , ' ' i return . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , whoa , ' ' riley says , placing herself between us , ` ` back to your corners , you two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he started it , ' ' i mutter , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson sc ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god , ' ' riley groans , ` ` just because you ' re in the same room again , does n ' t mean you get to rev ##ert back to your ang ##st - ridden teenage se ##lves . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before i can reply , the doorbell chi ##mes . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents are right outside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s my cue , ' ' emerson says , walking toward the door with me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry for what i said . [SEP]
[CLS] i didn ' t - ' ' ` ` me too , ' ' i say quickly , pausing before the door . [SEP]
[CLS] riley is kind enough to go back into her room for the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i at least give you one last birthday kiss ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , catching my hand and placing the ring box onto my palm . [SEP]
[CLS] i nod , clutching the box to my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson lowers his lips to mine , giving me a sweet , swift kiss goodnight . [SEP]
[CLS] i pocket the box , gi ##ddy and flushed , and pull open the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents are revealed to us in all their finer ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch them go stock - still , forced smiles paralyzed in place , as they see emerson beside me . [SEP]
[CLS] it takes them a moment , but recognition floods in at last . [SEP]
[CLS] and the second it does , the goodwill drains from their eyes in an instant , replaced by sheer rev ##ulsion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandmother breathe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is , ' ' emerson smiles , drawing himself up to his full , towering height . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good to see you again , jillian . [SEP]
[CLS] frank . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell is he doing here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandfather says to me , refusing to look at emerson for another second . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he was just leaving , ' ' emerson replies , ` ` but you all have a good night . [SEP]
[CLS] happy birthday again , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leans over and gives me a kiss on the cheek , and i watch as my grandparents ' eyes bug out of their heads . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m surprised they do n ' t keel over as he moves past them to the stairs and disappears from sight . [SEP]
[CLS] a long moment of silence un ##fold ##s as my grandparents stare at me , absolutely see ##thing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . do you guys want to come in , or - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i offer faintly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abigail cecil ##y rowan , ' ' my grandfather blu ##sters , charging into the apartment with grandmother on his heels , ` ` how dare you subject us to that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , taken aback by his outrage . [SEP]
[CLS] i knew they would n ' t be happy to see de ##b ' s son again after all these years , but they ' re absolutely liv ##id . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how could you blinds ##ide us like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandmother asks , her nose wrinkled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seeing that boy here , in our apartment - ' ' ` ` i thought this was my apartment , too , ' ' i cut in , ` ` i do live here , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rent free , ' ' grandpa sc ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' i reply ter ##sel ##y , ` ` i did n ' t realize that meant i could n ' t have a friend over to celebrate my birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] should i clear all my guests with you , or - ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a friend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] grandma hiss ##es , grabbing onto my wrist with surprising force for such an old lady . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think we ' re absolute idiots ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , ` ` i do n ' t understand why you ' re so upset about this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t understand why we ' re upset to see you hanging out with that piece of trash ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] grandpa shouts , slamming his fist down on the kitchen counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your father told us all about finding you two in bed together the morning after the wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s absolutely disgusting , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you have no business fra ##tern ##izing with someone of his kind - to say nothing of the fact that he was your step ##bro ##ther ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need to stop right there , ' ' i say firmly , yanking my arm out of my grandmother ' s grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know the first thing about emerson , or what happened between us when we were kids . [SEP]
[CLS] there was nothing disgusting about our relationship then , and there ' s nothing wrong with us spending time together now ! [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s a wonderful man . [SEP]
[CLS] a smart , successful , funny man who i care very deeply about . [SEP]
[CLS] why ca n ' t you respect that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his trash ##y mother ruined your father ' s life , ' ' grandma spit ##s , ` ` she and her jail ##bird husband were sucking him dry that whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] and just look at him now ! [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s an absolute wreck . [SEP]
[CLS] he never recovered from what that woman did to him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad ruined his own life , ' ' i tell them , ` ` de ##b did a terrible thing , taking advantage of him like that . [SEP]
[CLS] but he ' s a grown man . [SEP]
[CLS] no one forced him to re ##la ##pse . [SEP]
[CLS] no one made him refuse to go to rehab and get his life together . [SEP]
[CLS] he let himself go to pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] and even if de ##b and her husband did set him off , that has nothing to do with emerson ! [SEP]
[CLS] he and i were just kids when dad and de ##b got together . [SEP]
[CLS] we were innocent by ##stand ##ers to that whole train wreck . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t accept that , ' ' grandpa sniff ##s , crossing his arms , ` ` you ca n ' t possibly think that the son of two low ##life ##s could be anything but a piece of garbage himself . [SEP]
[CLS] the apple never falls far from the tree , dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back , ` ` well then what does that say about you , with everything dad ' s been through ? [SEP]
[CLS] what does it say about me , when he ' s such a wreck ? [SEP]
[CLS] terrible things can happen to good people , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' d seriously have us believe that this emerson is a good person ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] grandma sc ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would , ' ' i tell her , ` ` if you ' d just try and get to know him , you ' d see - ' ' ` ` this is ridiculous , ' ' grandpa mutter ##s , shaking his head , ` ` i wo n ' t hear another second of it . [SEP]
[CLS] jillian , do n ' t bother taking off your coat . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re not staying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i say , ` ` i thought we were going to spend some time together ? [SEP]
[CLS] get something to eat , and - ' ' ` ` i ' m afraid i ' ve lost my appetite , ' ' grandpa says grimly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just seeing that boy , being reminded of everything this family has gone through . . . it ' s too much . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t be subjected to this kind of nonsense . [SEP]
[CLS] especially not in an apartment i own myself ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must n ' t see that person again , abby , ' ' grandma says stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i actually let out a laugh at this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i must n ' t see him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , ca ##ck ##ling at the absurd ##ity of what she ' s said , ` ` well , that ' s not really an option , seeing as we work together , now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my grandparents gasp in unison . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve just been hired by the creative agency emerson works for , ' ' i inform them , ` ` i was going to tell you the good news over dinner , but . [SEP]
[CLS] well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for christ ' s sake , ' ' grandpa mutter ##s , ` ` what are you giving him in return for getting you this job ? [SEP]
[CLS] do i even want to know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at my grandfather , go ##bs ##mack ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think i got the job by . . . what ? [SEP]
[CLS] sleeping with emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think that little of me ? [SEP]
[CLS] of my abilities ? [SEP]
[CLS] i . . . i do n ' t even know what to say , grandpa . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` say that you wo n ' t get involved with that man outside of work , ' ' grandma plead ##s , ` ` especially not here , under our roof . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re so concerned with emerson not being under your roof , maybe i ' d better move , ' ' i say , exasperated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if that ' s what you want , ' ' grandpa says coldly , ` ` you can carry on with that man all you like , but you ' d best not expect to have anything to do with us if you choose to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] if you keep on with your disgrace ##ful little relationship with him , i ' m afraid we wo n ' t be able to continue being a part of your life , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll have to leave this apartment , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] and be content with never seeing us again . [SEP]
[CLS] if you can live with all that , go ahead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' d cut me out of your lives ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask quietly , ` ` just for being with emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we would , ' ' my grandfather assure ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' d have no other choice , ' ' my grandmother agrees with him . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a hint of sadness in her voice , but she ' s always gone along with what grandpa decides . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . . . ' ' i say , my voice hollow , ` ` you certainly have given me a lot to think about this evening . [SEP]
[CLS] and would you look at that , my appetite seems to be gone , too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you just call us when you ' ve come to your senses , ' ' grandpa says , heading for the door , ` ` or at least call to let us know if we need to start looking for a new tenant . [SEP]
[CLS] you have a couple of days to decide . [SEP]
[CLS] if we do n ' t hear from you , we ' ll assume you ' ve made your decision and act accordingly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t care what you decide to do about the apartment , ' ' i tell him , ` ` i ' m more than happy to find a new place to live , i can pay rent now that my job is lined up . [SEP]
[CLS] but cutting me out of your lives altogether ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s what hurts . [SEP]
[CLS] how can you be so mad at me , just for spending time with someone i care about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are n ' t mad at you , abby , ' ' grandma says , following him out , ` ` we ' re just terribly , terribly disappointed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i know the feeling , ' ' i whisper , wrapping my arms around my waist . [SEP]
[CLS] they march off into the elevator , and i slam the door in their wake . [SEP]
[CLS] hot , angry tears course down my cheeks as i press my back to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] how dare they say those horrible things about emerson ? [SEP]
[CLS] they do n ' t even know him . [SEP]
[CLS] and how could they threaten to cut me out of their lives , just for being with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe they ' d di ##so ##wn their only granddaughter over something so petty as a gr ##udge . [SEP]
[CLS] especially when that gr ##udge is built on nothing but bullshit ! [SEP]
[CLS] the injustice of it all has me reeling . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel the room spinning around me , and i know it ' s not just the boo ##ze that ' s knocking me off ki ##lter . [SEP]
[CLS] if my grandparents turn their backs on me , i ' ll be officially without any family in this world . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t really spoken to my dad for years , i have no aunt ##s and uncles , no cousins . [SEP]
[CLS] frank and jillian are it . [SEP]
[CLS] and they ' re ready to abandon me if i keep emerson in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##agger over to the couch , curling up into a ball and letting the tears come hard and fast . [SEP]
[CLS] the very thought of losing what ' s left of my family has me feeling un ##moor ##ed , alone . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not just having to find a new place to live that scares me , i can take care of that in no time . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the idea of losing my history , my only real links back to my mother , my old life , that terri ##fies me the most . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what . . . ' ' i mutter , as i feel something dig into my hip . [SEP]
[CLS] i reach into my pocket and feel my fingers close around the ring box emerson brought over tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i blink away my tears and open the box once more , staring down at the beautiful pearl ring . [SEP]
[CLS] with trembling fingers , i carefully pl ##uck the ring out of its cushion ##ed bed and slip it onto my right hand . [SEP]
[CLS] it fits perfectly . [SEP]
[CLS] after all these years , i still love it . [SEP]
[CLS] and if i ' m being honest , i still love the person who gave it to me , too . [SEP]
[CLS] daring ##ly , i slide the ring off and slip it , breathless ##ly , onto the other hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i look down at the single pearl , g ##lim ##mering on my left ring finger . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to say , i like the look of it there . [SEP]
[CLS] in that moment , i know that i ca n ' t cut emerson out of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] not again , no matter what it costs me in the end , he ' s worth whatever price i have to pay . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter fifteen i spend most of sunday recovering from my less - than - ideal birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] but before i know it , monday morning has arrived ; my first day on the job at bas ##tian creative . [SEP]
[CLS] my stomach is in knots as i get ready for the day . [SEP]
[CLS] i was already nervous to begin my dream job , but this weekend only ramp ##ed up the pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] with my cu ##sh ##y free housing likely to be yanked away , i need this first week at bas ##tian to go incredibly well . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s sure to be a bit of a probation period where cooper can let me go if i do n ' t fit in at bas ##tian . [SEP]
[CLS] so i guess my only choice is to be the model employee , even with my one - day step ##bro ##ther and potential lover training me . [SEP]
[CLS] sure . [SEP]
[CLS] no problem . [SEP]
[CLS] speaking of emerson , he did n ' t even try to get in touch with me after our roller coaster of a saturday night . [SEP]
[CLS] between our steam ##y make out session , our tu ##ss ##le over money issues , and my grandparents ' at ##ro ##cious behavior , i ' m not really sure where we stand . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , we ' re going to spend this entire week in each others ' company as i learn the ropes of my new job . [SEP]
[CLS] this should be interesting , that ' s for sure . [SEP]
[CLS] i arrive at the bas ##tian offices right on time , dressed in my best ` ` professional hips ##ter ' ' office attire . [SEP]
[CLS] but as i step out of the elevator , ready to dive into my training , i ' m surprised to find myself alone in the communal work ##room . [SEP]
[CLS] of the dozen or so other employees , no one else seems to be around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i call , glancing around in search of my cow ##or ##kers . [SEP]
[CLS] i check my phone and see that it is , indeed , 10 a . m . [SEP]
[CLS] the start of the work ##day . [SEP]
[CLS] what gives ? [SEP]
[CLS] for something to do , i head on over to the well - stocked bar and snack cart , where a fancy , gleaming es ##press ##o machine stands at the ready . [SEP]
[CLS] as i set to work craft ##ing myself an excellent cup of coffee , i hear footsteps behind me . [SEP]
[CLS] spinning around , i find myself face - to - face with the man i ' ve been thinking of inc ##ess ##antly for the past two days . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh abby , you should n ' t have ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson tease ##s , eyeing my es ##press ##o , ` ` it ' s not your job to make me coffee in the morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how convenient ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i chi ##rp , playing along with his bit as i grab my mug , ` ` because this sucker is all mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll just have to join you , then , ' ' emerson smiles , stepping around me to get at the es ##press ##o machine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` unless we ' re still doing that not - talking thing that i hate so much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not at all , ' ' i reply , my heart thumping wildly in my chest . [SEP]
[CLS] and not from the caf ##fe ##ine , either . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` provided that you do n ' t hate me after saturday night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' emerson laughs , ` ` i ' ve long since stopped caring about what people think of me , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] and i certainly do n ' t make a habit of holding peoples ' families against them . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry that i said those shitty things about your grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s not my place to judge them , even if they have no problem at all judging me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` man . [SEP]
[CLS] how ' s the weather up there on the high road ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , sipping my coffee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what can i say ? [SEP]
[CLS] that charming temper of mine is n ' t quite as hot as it was eight years ago , ' ' he replies , picking up his own mug of joe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` turns out that punching people is frowned upon in the tech industry . [SEP]
[CLS] who knew ? [SEP]
[CLS] so , what do you say ? [SEP]
[CLS] are we all right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re all right , ' ' i smile back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see you like your present , ' ' he observes , looking down at my right hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah , ' ' i reply , admiring the silver ring once again . [SEP]
[CLS] thank god i remembered to put it back on the right hand , rather than the left . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s beautiful , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you still think so , after all this time , ' ' he says , ` ` still the same old abby , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more or less , ' ' i shrug , ` ` though i seem to be more ob ##no ##xious ##ly pun ##ct ##ual these days . [SEP]
[CLS] where is everyone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , cooper does n ' t usually roll in until noon or so , and the rest of the office has taken to his schedule , ' ' emerson tells me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` je ##ez , ' ' i say , ` ` just when i was thinking this job could n ' t get any better . . . ' ' ` ` it ' s a pretty sweet gig , ' ' emerson agrees , ` ` we work hard , but on our own terms . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never been happier with any other company i ' ve worked for . [SEP]
[CLS] i figured i ' d get here early to meet you today , show you the ropes before everyone gets here . [SEP]
[CLS] ready to start , protege ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all set , ' ' i say , draining the rest of my coffee , ` ` teach me your ways , o ' wise one . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the day un ##fold ##s before us as emerson walks me through all the ins and outs of the agency . [SEP]
[CLS] my job will mostly consist of brains ##torm ##ing new ideas for marketing and branding before passing them along to different clients . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get to execute my ideas using bas ##tian ' s top - of - the - line design suite , too . [SEP]
[CLS] i never thought that i ' d get to have a job that i actually like , especially not this early on in my career . [SEP]
[CLS] between the new gig at bas ##tian and emerson happening back into my life , 26 is shaping up to be a fine year , indeed . . . that is , as long as i do n ' t think of the whole grandparents - di ##so ##wn ##ing - me - thing . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i are sitting together at one end of the communal desk as our cow ##or ##kers begin to arrive a couple hours later . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone greet ##s me in a cord ##ial , if not chip ##per , way . [SEP]
[CLS] but hey , we ' re all millennia ##ls , that ' s how we roll . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d rather they be real with me than overly enthusiastic . [SEP]
[CLS] i recognize a few people - bradley , tyler , and emily - from the other night at the bar . [SEP]
[CLS] they all smile politely at me as they settle down to work , but i can feel their eyes darting back and forth between emerson and me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure they ' re wondering what we were doing at the bar together , what the nature of our relationship is , all that . [SEP]
[CLS] i almost laugh , thinking about how i ' d explain our relationship these days : ` ` oh , you know , we were step - siblings for a day , slept together once , have n ' t seen each other in ten years , but yeah - it ' s totally chill ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i decide not to worry about what anyone else might be thinking and focus on learning the ropes . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of my first day , i feel like i ' m starting to have an idea of all that the job will en ##tail , and i ' m more excited than ever to keep learning more . [SEP]
[CLS] it turns out , emerson is a great teacher . [SEP]
[CLS] cooper does n ' t roll into until after noon , just like emerson said . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiles around at his worker bees , and comes over to say hello to me and emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s your first day so far , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks jo ##vial ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have n ' t broken anything yet , ' ' i reply , ` ` so i guess it ' s all good ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s a natural at this , ' ' emerson tells cooper . [SEP]
[CLS] out of the corner of my eye , i see tyler nu ##dge bradley and shoot him a knowing look . [SEP]
[CLS] i should remind emerson not to praise me too vocal ##ly around the others . [SEP]
[CLS] it might get people talking about us . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe even feeling a little jealous of my friendly relationship with one of the agency ' s higher - ups . [SEP]
[CLS] my grandfather ' s qui ##p about what i might have done with emerson to get this job still sting ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want anyone here getting the same idea . [SEP]
[CLS] though glancing around the communal works ##tation , it looks like it might be too late for that . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel myself growing quiet as the day wears on , self - conscious of what my cow ##or ##kers might be saying about my rather cozy relationship with the head of the company ' s european branch . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time we all start to clock out and head home once more , my jaw may as well be wired shut . [SEP]
[CLS] my growing silence is n ' t lost on emerson , either . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know it ' s a lot to take in all at once , ' ' he says , as we step into the elevator together with a few other cow ##or ##kers , ` ` but you really are doing a great job . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to do so well here , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m proud of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my tongue until we reach the ground floor . [SEP]
[CLS] as the other bas ##tian employees head off in their own directions , emerson and i fall into step with each other out on the sidewalk . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel like i can breathe again for the first time in hours . [SEP]
[CLS] never under ##est ##imate the st ##if ##ling nature of cow ##or ##kers ' judge ##y passive aggression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how does it not bother you that people are clearly gossip ##ing about us in there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask emerson , as we head for the subway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , cock ##ing an eyebrow at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our cow ##or ##kers , ' ' i spell it out , ` ` they obviously know that something ' s up between us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , something is up , is n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , slipping an arm around my waist in his mischievous fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` seriously emerson , ' ' i say , drawing to a stop beside the subway entrance , ` ` are n ' t you worried that this could mess things up for us at work ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' he says shortly , looking a bit ir ##ked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not worried about being f ##od ##der for the rumor mill for a week or two . [SEP]
[CLS] this is n ' t high school , ab . [SEP]
[CLS] gossip ca n ' t hurt you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it could be a bigger deal than that , ' ' i reply anxiously , ` ` i mean , what if cooper does n ' t approve of us . . . being whatever we are ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can he di ##sa ##pp ##rove of ' whatever we are ' if we have n ' t even decided what we are yet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson counters . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##of . [SEP]
[CLS] this is making my head hurt , ' ' i laugh , the tension of the day di ##sp ##elling now that we ' re out of the office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bet i have the cure for what ai ##ls you , ' ' he replies , taking my hand in his and tugging me down the block . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s my train , ' ' i inform him , glancing back at the subway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' he says , ` ` but my apartment is this way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you inviting me over ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , trailing along behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` obviously , ' ' he laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what . . . for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , digging my heels in ever - so - slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in case you ' ve forgotten , i ' m a pretty decent cook , ' ' he replies , ` ` let me make you dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] we can call it a bela ##ted double - birthday celebration , since our other attempts at celebrating got . . . der ##ailed this weekend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dinner at emerson ' s apartment ? [SEP]
[CLS] that sounds an awful lot like a romantic evening to me . [SEP]
[CLS] and though i know it would be wise to take this whole thing slow , i just ca n ' t resist him tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] who am i kidding - when have i ever been able to resist emerson sawyer ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i smile , ` ` lead on , iron chef . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] we swing by a fancy high - end grocery store on the way to emerson ' s apartment so he can gather his ingredients . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t help but smile wi ##st ##fully as i think of the last time he cooked for me . [SEP]
[CLS] there was so much sweetness and sorrow wrapped up in those few fleeting weeks of our younger years that any thought of them is bursting with remembered sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , it ' s not like this reunion of ours has been without its emotional moments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here we are , ' ' emerson says , drawing to a stop on a gorgeous block lined with cozy cafes and class ##y boutique ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he leads me up a set of stone steps and unlock ##s a door there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is where you live ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , glancing over my shoulder at the cosmopolitan block . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure is , ' ' he says , holding the door for me . [SEP]
[CLS] i expect to walk into the lobby of an apartment building , a ground floor leading off to a bunch of different units . [SEP]
[CLS] but as emerson nu ##dge ##s open a second door and steps through , i feel my jaw drop . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire space inside is an open , spacious loft . [SEP]
[CLS] this entire building is his . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve watched enough house - hunting reality tv to know that this is easily a multi - million dollar property - and this is n ' t even his only place ! [SEP]
[CLS] the imp ##oss ##ibly high ceilings vault above a perfectly - arranged interior . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a huge , sparkling kitchen , a sunken living room , and an enclosed bedroom off the main space . [SEP]
[CLS] huge , towering windows take up the entire wall opposite us , and lead off onto a private terrace . [SEP]
[CLS] the design is mostly minimal - white walls and hardwood floors - with purpose ##ful touches of natural materials like wood and stone . [SEP]
[CLS] the appliances and decor are an art ##ful mix of new and vintage . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s home is utterly perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] it could have been ripped right off my ` ` dream home ' ' pin ##ter ##est page . [SEP]
[CLS] amazing how our tastes are so aligned , even though we come from totally different backgrounds and have led completely different lives . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d call that a good sign . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as a throw pillow comes barrel ##ing my way , only to realize in the next moment that the gallo ##ping bundle of white flu ##ff is actually an adorable little west highland terri ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the tiny dog col ##lide ##s with my legs , tail wa ##gging a million miles an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must be ro ##xie , ' ' i laugh , reaching down to scratch her ears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s the lady of the house , ' ' emerson smiles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` house ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i shoot back , kneeling down to get a better look at the friendly west ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more like palace . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pick your jaw up off the floor and tell me what kind of wine you like , ' ' he laughs , setting the groceries down on the kitchen island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something red , ' ' i say , staring in wonder at the imp ##ec ##cable space . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` coming right up , ' ' he replies , opening a concealed miniature wine cellar nestled into the island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how does a nice rio ##ja sound ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it sounds . . . nice , ' ' i tell him , settling down at one of the wooden stool ##s before the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] ro ##xie follows me over into the kitchen and sits at my feet , staring up at me with ami ##able , adorable curiosity . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she likes you , ' ' emerson observes , pausing to give ro ##xie a good nu ##zzling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] she has wonderful taste , ' ' i kid , flipping my blonde hair theatrical ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] he produces a couple of wine glasses and pour ##s generous ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to our 26th years , ' ' he smiles , cl ##inking my glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to you not doing too sha ##bb ##ily for yourself , ' ' i reply , taking a sip of the delicious wine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , you told me how well you ' ve made out with this app development gig , but holy crap . [SEP]
[CLS] this loft , emerson . . . ' ' ` ` i ' m glad you like it , ' ' he says , gathering and prep ##ping his ingredients . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i actually prefer it to my place in london , to tell you the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] but that ' s where cooper decided he needs me most , so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it takes a second for emerson ' s words to click . [SEP]
[CLS] of course . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s not even based here at the new york offices of bas ##tian . [SEP]
[CLS] he runs the show in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] that means , of course , that he ' s probably due back there soon . [SEP]
[CLS] like , the end of the week soon . [SEP]
[CLS] why did n ' t i think of that before ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , heating up some olive oil in a cast iron skill ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah , ' ' i say , snapping back to attention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just . . . kind of forgot that this is a temporary situation . [SEP]
[CLS] you being in new york . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm , ' ' he mutter ##s , non ##com ##mit ##tal ##ly , ` ` it ' s true , i did only swing by to train the new recruit at cooper ' s request . [SEP]
[CLS] if i could have known that you were the new recruit , well . . . ' ' ` ` well what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , leaning my elbows on the island . [SEP]
[CLS] he glances over his shoulder at me , smiling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i would n ' t have bought a return ticket , in the end . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m torn between el ##ation and tre ##pid ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] best not force the issue of what ' s going to happen between us once my training is complete and focus on the moment at hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch as emerson grill ##s two del ##ect ##able salmon fill ##ets , blanche ##s some bro ##cco ##li ra ##be , and prepares a small batch of pest ##o pasta . [SEP]
[CLS] the food smells amazing , the wine is fantastic , and i ' m here with one of my favorite people on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] today may have been a little bit rough , but it sure is shaping up nicely . [SEP]
[CLS] if i try real hard , i can pretend that this is what my life is like every day , and forget that this is just a fleeting anomaly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here we go , ' ' emerson says proudly , pl ##ating our food and nodding toward the terrace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` shall we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i follow him out onto the secluded patio with ro ##xie right on my heels . [SEP]
[CLS] we settle down at a little table beneath a canopy of string lights and overgrown ivy . [SEP]
[CLS] i know i should n ' t get attached to this place , this feeling , but i ca n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] this is all so . . . perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] and that ' s even before i taste the food . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my god . . . ' ' i murmur , taking my first bite of perfectly grille ##d salmon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` better than my ri ##so ##tto , even ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , helping himself to his meal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never would have thought it possible but , yes , ' ' i ex ##claim , sa ##vor ##ing the taste . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i kept up with the hobby , ' ' he says modest ##ly , ` ` spending a bit of time in france certainly whipped my cooking skills into shape . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you lived in france ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , wide - eyed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yeah , ' ' he nods , ` ` france , england , spain , even finland for a while . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` damn , ' ' i whistle , ` ` i ' ve been in the same apartment since i was eighteen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing wrong with having roots , ' ' he replies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . . . ' ' i murmur , thinking of my grandparents ' threat to tear those roots right out from under me . [SEP]
[CLS] we sa ##vor our incredible meal , the fine wine , each other ' s company - and of course the delightful presence of ro ##xie . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s shaping up to be a pretty good first day at the new job after all , even if this is strictly extra - cu ##rricular . [SEP]
[CLS] the evening wears on , a couple more glasses of wine are poured , and emerson even manages to find a record we can both agree on - iron and wine , an old favorite of ours . [SEP]
[CLS] we retire back into the loft , and i mean ##der about the space at my leisure , taking in all the little details that make his house a home . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d offer you a grand tour , ' ' emerson says , watching me from the center of the room , ` ` but this is pretty much it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about in there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , nodding toward the bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you trying to get a peek at my bedroom , rowan ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , grinning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i am , sawyer , ' ' i shrug , ` ` unless you ' re afraid of me finding your playboy st ##ash or something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this from the girl who kept a vi ##bra ##tor within arm ' s length through her entire adolescence , ' ' he laughs , walking toward his room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have needs , ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ex ##claim , fei ##gni ##ng defensive ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he replies , his voice going ras ##py around the edges as he pauses in the doorway of his bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] the delicious wine has lowered both of our inhibition ##s , and my body comes alive as i feel us transition ##ing into the more . . . sensual part of the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] we have n ' t mentioned our steam ##y kiss from this weekend , yet , but we seem to be coming back around to right where we left off . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s blue eyes flash with desire as i step up to him , resting a hand on the firm pan ##es of his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know about my needs better than anyone , ' ' i say softly , trailing my fingers down his cut , defined torso . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll just have to see what we can do about them , then , ' ' he murmurs , catching my wrist . [SEP]
[CLS] my eyes go wide as he draws my hand to his full lips and takes the tip of my finger into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his tongue brush against my finger ##tip , remember what it felt like to feel his mouth other places . . . and break off into his room , chest pounding . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a small , simple space with high ceilings and a huge king bed front and center . [SEP]
[CLS] a sleek dresser and wide window round out the space , and a few well - placed keeps ##akes make it feel like a sacred space . [SEP]
[CLS] i trail my fingers along the dresser , setting down my drained glass of wine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just on the far edge of tips ##y , and my cares are swirling away by the second . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a few framed pictures on the dresser , and my stomach turns to see an old wedding photo . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t of our parents ' ridiculous ceremony , of course , but i do recognize a much - younger de ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] this must be from her first wedding to emerson ' s father , a man who looks remarkably like the one standing next to me now . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##b looks so happy . [SEP]
[CLS] healthy , even . [SEP]
[CLS] it breaks my heart to think of what her life has become . [SEP]
[CLS] i tear my eyes away from the old picture and notice that a second frame holds not a photograph , but a drawing . [SEP]
[CLS] it only takes a split second for me to recognize it , and as soon as i do , i feel my hand fly to my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] there , on emerson ' s dresser , is the sketch of him i drew when we were kids , the one i gave to him on his eighteenth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] the drawing features him in half - profile , looking serious and sure . [SEP]
[CLS] i worked on this piece for hours - days , even - before giving it to him in that seaside motel room . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been preserved perfectly , loving ##ly , and for a spell i ' m too moved to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] two strong arms wrap around my waist from behind as i stare at the picture of teenage emerson , drawn by my very own hand . [SEP]
[CLS] i clasp his hands where they rest against my body , letting my head lean back against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you kept it , ' ' i whisper , turning my face toward his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' he murmurs , resting his cheek against the top of my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that picture has traveled the world with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve kept it in every home i ' ve ever lived in , from my little apartment in phil ##ly to my flat in london . [SEP]
[CLS] every time i get to thinking that i do n ' t deserve my success , that i ' m just some punk kid who ' s pulling one over on the rest of the world , i just look at this picture . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s always reminded me that there ' s someone in the world who thinks i ' m strong , and worthy . [SEP]
[CLS] someone who loved me , once . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` loves you , ' ' i whisper , turning to face him , ` ` not loved . [SEP]
[CLS] loves . [SEP]
[CLS] present tense . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i was supposed to be the teacher this week , ' ' he murmurs , running his hands down the sides of my body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing giving me a grammar lesson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i think we both still have plenty to teach each other , emerson , ' ' i say , taking his sc ##ruff ##y , sculpted face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean it , then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , grabbing hold of my slender hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you . . . you still . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , emerson , ' ' i whisper , letting those blue eyes swallow me whole . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i always have . [SEP]
[CLS] i always will . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank god , ' ' he grins , pulling me to him , ` ` ' un ##re ##qui ##ted ' is n ' t a good shade on me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean . . . ' ' i breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you too , abby , ' ' he says , ` ` but right now , i need you too much to waste another second talking about it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine by me , ' ' i murmur . [SEP]
[CLS] i throw my arms around emerson ' s shoulders as he brings his lips to mine . [SEP]
[CLS] he scoop ##s me up into his arms as his powerful jaw works my mouth wide open . [SEP]
[CLS] i clasp my ankles around his tape ##red waist , and he bears my weight as if it were nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue glide ##s against mine , caressing it , as he spins me around in the air , laying me out flat across his king bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he lowers his staggering body to mine , encompassing me , sub ##sum ##ing me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel his every muscle ripple as we move together , a tangle of limbs and lust . [SEP]
[CLS] i bury my fingers in his hair , letting my tongue sweep against his as his hands roam down the length of my body . [SEP]
[CLS] he tastes exactly the same , beneath the fine red wine . [SEP]
[CLS] but while our bodies find the same easy sync ##opa ##tion we ' ve always known , there ' s more sure ##ness and grace in our motion . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson was all raw power at eighteen , but now ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s totally comfortable in his body , assured and knowledge ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] his every muscle is a tightly coiled spring of power and fines ##se . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve been craving his touch for eight years , but i never could have guessed how good it could possibly feel to have it again . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no precious ##ness in our desire , now . [SEP]
[CLS] no need for things to be right or perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] we just need each other , in the raw ##est , most car ##nal way . [SEP]
[CLS] we tear at each other ' s clothing , ripping off layers and tossing them across the room . [SEP]
[CLS] i rake my nails across the firm planes of his body - his rip ##pling back , his imp ##oss ##ibly cut torso - as he grabs hold of whatever part of me he can . [SEP]
[CLS] in a matter of minutes , our naked bodies are pressed together on his king bed , our skin flushed with want , our mouths ins ##ati ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i almost forgot this , ' ' i whisper , tracing the outline of his sparrow tattoo as he knee ##ls above me . [SEP]
[CLS] his cock is rock hard , throbbing at its full , massive best . [SEP]
[CLS] i bring my hands eagerly to that pu ##ls ##ating length , shivering with delight as i wrap my fingers around his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes close as i work my hands along the full stretch of him , my thumbs tracing along the ridge of his swollen head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` almost forgot this , too , ' ' i grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growls , catching my wrists and pinning them over my head , ` ` well , let me remind you of a few other things , while we ' re at it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes rake down along the length of my naked body . [SEP]
[CLS] my back arches as if his very gaze is caressing me . [SEP]
[CLS] i let my knees fall open as he brings his lips to the hollow of my throat , leaving searing kisses all along my skin . [SEP]
[CLS] he lowers himself to me as he moves his mouth over my body , letting me feel the tip of him brush against my wet slit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so ready for me , ' ' he growls , pressing his cock forward by just a hair as he kn ##ead ##s my tits with capable hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he pinch ##es my nipples just hard enough , and i cry out as the first thunder ##ing shock ##wave of pleasure runs through me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` christ , ' ' i breathe , my eyes wide with wonder , ` ` you know exactly how to touch me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in reply , he lowers his lips to my nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] keeping his eyes on mine , he takes that hard peak into his mouth , rubbing against it with the tip of his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] i gasp as his fingers skirt down my lean torso and find my wet , aching sex . [SEP]
[CLS] sucking and biting at my tits , he traces his fingers along the slick length of me , working farther into me with every pass before he finally , glorious ##ly , lays two strong fingers against my hard , throbbing clit . [SEP]
[CLS] my head falls back against the pillows as he bites my nipple , tracing firm , quick circles over that tender nu ##b between my legs . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab onto huge handful ##s of bed ##ding , forcing myself to breathe as he rolls his fingers over my clit , faster and harder with every moment . [SEP]
[CLS] my knees begin to tremble as i dig my nails into his back , holding on for dear life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` right there , ' ' i moan , as he flick ##s and kn ##ead ##s that pulsing bundle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` god , that ' s good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think that ' s good ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growls , catching a handful of my blonde hair in his hand and turning me to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] the sudden jolt of force coupled with his expert touch between my legs nearly makes me come right then and there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just wait . . . ' ' he gives me a swift , hard kiss , working my jaw open and letting his tongue sweep deeply into my mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] i wrap my arms around his neck , shuddering on the edge of orgasm as he bears down on my clit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so close , ' ' i whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how close ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growls in my ear , forcing my knees further apart with his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . so . . . ' ' i gasp , my eyes screwing up in bliss . [SEP]
[CLS] i tee ##ter on the edge , ready to tumble . [SEP]
[CLS] but the room spins around as emerson grabs hold of my hips , flip ##s me roughly onto my stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] shock and illicit delight con ##fo ##und me as i look back at him over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a savage hunger burning in his blue eyes as he knee ##ls over me from behind , letting me feel his enormous cock against the tight , forbidden circle of my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] for just a moment , i think i know where we ' re headed , but again he surprises me . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling me forcefully onto my hands and knees , emerson runs his fingers into the firm rise of my ass . [SEP]
[CLS] i arch my back , knowing how much he loves to drink in the sight of me wild with needing him . [SEP]
[CLS] with a low , gut ##tura ##l growl , he tugs me back toward him , lowering his mouth to my sex . [SEP]
[CLS] my mouth falls open in amazement as he pushes against my flesh , parting me before him from behind . [SEP]
[CLS] the illicit thrill is almost too much , which makes it just enough to drive me absolutely crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] i sa ##vor the sensation of his tongue tracing all along my slit , licking me from behind . [SEP]
[CLS] the very next moment , i feel the tip of his tongue against my raw , tender clit . [SEP]
[CLS] i buck against him as he has his fill of me , licking up every drop of my desire as he works that hard button . [SEP]
[CLS] i barrel toward the edge of bliss , blinded by the force of it . [SEP]
[CLS] my screams echo around the small room as emerson wraps his lips around my clit and gives it one last forceful suck . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m done for . [SEP]
[CLS] with an el ##ated scream , i come hard into his waiting mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] my limbs shudder with the force of the orgasm that rolls wildly through me , lighting up every nerve ending with unprecedented sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson drinks me up , unable to get enough , until i ' m absolutely spent . [SEP]
[CLS] i turn to look back at him , dizzy and amazed . [SEP]
[CLS] in the throbbing aftermath of my bliss , i can only think of one thing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need you to fuck me , emerson , ' ' i breathe , on my hands and knees before him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to feel you inside of me . [SEP]
[CLS] now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as if i could wait another second , ' ' he growls , taking my face in his and kissing me deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] i can taste myself on his tongue , and shudder with delighted anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] with his mouth on mine , he lifts my body and presses me hard against his wooden head ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] i grab on tight as he moves behind me , flat ##ten ##ing me against the sturdy surface . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s just enough time for me to take a breath as he produces a condom from the bedside table , tears the package open with his teeth , and rolls it down his throbbing shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] i brace myself , lifting my ass to emerson as i feel him poised behind me , his hard chest heaving with anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] our voices rise together in a soaring moan as emerson drives his cock into my waiting , eager body . [SEP]
[CLS] my fingers dig into the head ##board as he splits me open , slamming into the very core of me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never felt him this way before , never dreamed anyone could reach me so deeply , so fully . [SEP]
[CLS] i press myself back into his every thrust , taking him in as far as i can . [SEP]
[CLS] my head falls back between my shoulders as emerson pounds into me , his fingers digging into my hips and his thumb pressing around my ass - the feeling so intensely illicit it drives me crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] with every pass , i feel more of him . [SEP]
[CLS] i swear , he grows harder by the second as i cl ##ing to the head ##board , dash ##ing myself against him with all my might . [SEP]
[CLS] his grasp tighten ##s as he care ##ens toward the edge himself . [SEP]
[CLS] i bear down as his pace becomes quicker , his buck ##ing hips more intent . [SEP]
[CLS] i know he ' s about to lose it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come , ' ' i gasp , turning to meet his gleaming blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to - ' ' he rear ##s back and drives into me with one last , breath ##taking thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] we cry out in unison as he er ##upt ##s inside of me . [SEP]
[CLS] our bodies are run through with sweeping sensation , and we ride the crashing wave together . [SEP]
[CLS] we peak and collapse together , folding into one tangle of spent limbs . [SEP]
[CLS] our chests rise and fall like mad as i curl into emerson ' s muscular side . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulls me close , en ##cl ##osing me in his arms as our breathing slowly even ##s out . [SEP]
[CLS] the record finally ends as we lay in emerson ' s bed together . [SEP]
[CLS] in the warm , easy silence , we finally swim back to the surface of reality , gazing at each other in the half light . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe i went nearly a decade without this , ' ' i laugh softly , running a hand through his closely crop ##ped brown hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me either , ' ' he grins , kissing my palm , ` ` let ' s not do that again , ok ? [SEP]
[CLS] the being - apart thing , i mean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds good to me , ' ' i sigh happily , resting my cheek against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could n ' t stand to lose this again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t , ' ' he says , his voice taking on a serious cast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever happens , abby , i wo n ' t let anything ruin this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the world reforms around us , the na ##gging intrusion ##s of the real world creep back into my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to believe that nothing can der ##ail us now , that we ' re home free . [SEP]
[CLS] but what about my family ? [SEP]
[CLS] our parents ? [SEP]
[CLS] our history ? [SEP]
[CLS] what about our careers , and that fact that we live on different continents ? [SEP]
[CLS] but as emerson kisses away the worried cr ##ease between my eyebrows , all those unknown factors fade away . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s only him and me , now . [SEP]
[CLS] alone in this beautiful soho apartment with another bottle of wine just waiting to be opened and a little bundle of white fur leaping up onto the bed to cu ##ddle at our feet . [SEP]
[CLS] i wonder if this is what things would have been like if we had n ' t been separated all those years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] would we have been able to continue on as a pair and wind up here eventually ? [SEP]
[CLS] or did we need to be apart for that time , grow into our own se ##lves before we could be together ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s impossible to know , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , it ' s a comfort to think that all the pain we ' ve been through , separately and together , has n ' t been in vain . [SEP]
[CLS] that our whole lives have been leading up to something wonderful that we now get to share . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' emerson says , easing my up from bed and handing me my top , ` ` we have n ' t even had dessert yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re perfect , you know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i sigh , slipping back into my clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] i know , ' ' he tease ##s , leaning in for another kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] we head back out into the loft half - dressed , open up a bottle of pin ##ot gr ##ig ##io , and dig into a couple pin ##ts of ice cream - ta ##hiti ##an mint for me , black cherry for him . [SEP]
[CLS] settling down onto the expansive , pillow ##y couch , we talk late into the night , halfway paying attention to some mu ##sh ##y rom - com that ' s playing on tv as we rev ##el in playing house together . [SEP]
[CLS] i hardly even notice as i start drifting off into a sat ##ed , happy sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] my appetite ##s - all of them - have never felt so satisfied as they do tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter sixteen sloppy kisses land all over my sleeping face , dragging me out of sl ##umber . [SEP]
[CLS] man , has emerson lost his sm ##oo ##ching prowess already ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think to myself , pry ##ing my eyes open . [SEP]
[CLS] but as i blink into the morning sunlight , it is n ' t emerson ' s blue eyes i find staring back at me , but ro ##xie ' s chocolate brown pee ##pers . [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh , giving her a good scratch behind the ears and pulling myself to sitting . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve fallen asleep on the couch with my head in emerson ' s lap . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s still out , and i help myself to a moment of watching him sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] his features are soft and relaxed , as gorgeous as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i have the privilege of seeing him this way again . [SEP]
[CLS] swinging my legs over the couch , delicately so as not to wake him , i reach into my purse and grab for my phone . [SEP]
[CLS] i blink down at the welcome screen and see a dozen texts from riley , asking where i am . [SEP]
[CLS] there are missed calls , too , a good handful . [SEP]
[CLS] and not just from riley , either . [SEP]
[CLS] the bas ##tian offices seem to have called my phone , more than a few times . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , i ca n ' t imagine why . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , until i see what time it is . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fuck ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out , tumbling off the couch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` huh ? [SEP]
[CLS] what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson mum ##bles , snapping out of his sl ##umber and looking wildly around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the matter ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s twelve thirty already ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i tell him , scrambling to my feet in a panic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re supposed to be at work ! [SEP]
[CLS] how the hell did we overs ##lee ##p ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guess we wore each other out last night , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson smiles , reaching for me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t , ' ' i snap , tearing off in search of my clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re going to be an hour late to work , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s only my second day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , ' ' he says , following me into the bedroom , ` ` i ' ll vo ##uch for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' ll look awesome , ' ' i shoot back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` me stroll ##ing in on my superior ' s arm , getting special treatment because i happen to be fucking the right person . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa , slow down , ' ' he says , ` ` first of all , i did n ' t mean to off ##end you , i just do n ' t think this is as big a deal as you ' re making it out to be . [SEP]
[CLS] cooper does n ' t even show up until noon , remember ? [SEP]
[CLS] and secondly , i did n ' t realize we were just ' fucking ' , here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not - i ' m just - ' ' i st ##am ##mer , shoving my hands through my hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been dreaming about a job like this for months . [SEP]
[CLS] years . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , when i finally get my foot in the door , i fuck it up immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] god , i do n ' t even have any fresh clothes to wear ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to have to show up in the same thing i wore yesterday , and everyone ' s going to know that we - ' ' ` ` here , ' ' emerson says , reaching into his wallet and withdrawing a credit card . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take this . [SEP]
[CLS] go to the shop downstairs and buy something new . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll head right over to the office . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t take your card , ' ' i say , gaping at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s . . . it ' s yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugs , ` ` it ' s partially my fault we overs ##le ##pt . [SEP]
[CLS] let me help fix it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but - ' ' ` ` go , ' ' he insists , pressing the card into my palm , ` ` i ' ll get dressed and meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] reeling , i gather my things and tr ##und ##le out of emerson ' s loft onto the soho street . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a tiny boutique downstairs , cho ##ck full of incredible items . [SEP]
[CLS] the shop girl raises an eyebrow as i barrel in , but forget ##s her troubles when i hand her the surprisingly heavy credit card . [SEP]
[CLS] in no time flat , she has me styled in a combination of new and vintage pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson appears as i ' m being run ##g up , impressed by my sleek black jeans , silky yellow blouse , and gr ##ung ##y stud ##ded jacket . [SEP]
[CLS] i nearly faint as i see what this outfit is going to cost , but emerson does n ' t even bat an eye as his card is charged . [SEP]
[CLS] i still ca n ' t get used to the idea that money is no issue for him . [SEP]
[CLS] and i definitely do n ' t know how to feel about using his money for myself . [SEP]
[CLS] but no time to debate the issue now , we ' ve got to book it . [SEP]
[CLS] we set off for our office , which is thankfully located in the same neighborhood as emerson ' s apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , by the time we step into the elevators , it ' s one in the afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i bounce on the balls of my feet as the elevator lifts us up to the offices , feeling anxious and guilty . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take a breath , abby , ' ' emerson tells me , as we draw level with our floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure no one ' s even going to notice that we ' re - ' ' as the doors slide open , i feel the breath catch in my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] a dozen faces whip around in unison as the entire office turns to stare at us . [SEP]
[CLS] every face at the communal desk stares at me and emerson una ##bas ##hed ##ly as we step onto the floor side - by - side . [SEP]
[CLS] i can feel my cheeks burning as my co - workers ' gazes go from curious to smug . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure they all spent the entire morning wondering if emerson and i were together , and now their suspicions have been confirmed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cooper asked to see you both as soon as you got in today , ' ' says emily , one of the people who saw me and emerson at that bar together . [SEP]
[CLS] the corners of her mouth are turned up in a grin that ' s starving for scandal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' emerson says curt ##ly , drawing himself up to his full height . [SEP]
[CLS] he has no reason to be cow ##ed by our co - workers ' scrutiny . [SEP]
[CLS] he has senior ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] and a billion - dollar bank account . [SEP]
[CLS] i , on the other hand , am absolutely leveled . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t believe i ' ve let myself become a joke within my first forty - eight hours here . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nice du ##ds , ' ' mutter ##s tyler , sc ##oping out my outfit as emerson and i hurry past the desk toward cooper ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what a sugar daddy will get you , ' ' bradley stage whispers . [SEP]
[CLS] delighted chuckles go up all around the table , and my embarrassment harden ##s into anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you focus on the task at hand instead of s ##ni ##ping like a little pre ##tee ##n , beard ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i snap back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow . [SEP]
[CLS] someone ' s touch ##y , ' ' he says , raising his bush ##y eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought hot sex was supposed to be relaxing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , bradley ' ' emerson cuts in , whipping around the face the alternative do ##uche bag . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you try shutting the fuck up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the room goes quiet around us as bradley and his co ##hort ##s back down . [SEP]
[CLS] but instead of this being a relief , it only adds to my annoyance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t fight my battles for me , ' ' i mutter to emerson , marching toward cooper ' s door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your battles ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shoots back , ` ` you ' re in this alone now , are you ? [SEP]
[CLS] i could have sworn that it takes two to overs ##lee ##p after tearing up the bed sheets all night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m just - ' ' i begin , but the frost ##ed glass door swings open before i can finish . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re here , ' ' cooper says , appearing in the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] his jolly demeanor has totally vanished , in its place is nothing but a cool , detached stare . [SEP]
[CLS] the transformation is total , and it takes me off guard . [SEP]
[CLS] but emerson ' s not worried - or at least , he ' s pretending not to be . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wanted to see us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , stroll ##ing into the office . [SEP]
[CLS] i hurry in after him , feeling a dozen judgment ##al stares boring into my back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' cooper replies crisp ##ly , closing the door behind him and taking a seat at his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have a seat , you two . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have a seat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson laughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` feeling a bit formal today , coop ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just sit down , emerson , ' ' cooper shoots back . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i sink down into the two chairs before cooper ' s desk . [SEP]
[CLS] our boss looks back and forth between us , his expression un ##rea ##dable . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson , for his part , looks cool as a cu ##cum ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] i , on the other hand , probably look like i ' m going to be sick . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , i just might be , depending on how this little meeting goes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the last thing i want to do in my precious free time is intercept office gossip , ' ' cooper begins , crossing his arms over his sweater vest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but the buzz about you two has been a bit impossible to ignore this morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` people like to talk , ' ' emerson shrugs , leaning back in his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] i glance at him nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] his non ##chal ##ance could very easily read as di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` be that as it may , ' ' cooper goes on , ` ` whatever it is that ' s going on between you two is distracting the rest of your cow ##or ##kers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` again , i do n ' t see how that ' s news , ' ' emerson presses , ` ` they need to mind their own business and focus on their work . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s rather rich , coming from you , ' ' cooper says test ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson replies , ` ` i take my work for bas ##tian very seriously , cooper . [SEP]
[CLS] you know that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper shoots back , ` ` is that why you missed our conference call with new zealand this morning ? [SEP]
[CLS] because you take this work so seriously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i watch as the color drains out of emerson ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time since we woke up this morning , he fa ##lter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` damn , ' ' emerson murmurs , sitting up in his chair , ` ` new zealand . [SEP]
[CLS] i forgot . [SEP]
[CLS] cooper , i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i just - ' ' ` ` just what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper cuts him off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` overs ##le ##pt ? [SEP]
[CLS] blew it off ? [SEP]
[CLS] what explanation could you possibly have ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re my right hand man in europe , sawyer , but that does n ' t mean you can just come and go as you please . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought you were committed to your position here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am , ' ' emerson insists , ` ` it was just a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] look , abby and i have been having a pretty strange week - ' ' i wince as i ' m brought into the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] cooper raises an eyebrow looking at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a strange week ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he says flatly , ` ` miss rowan , has your first week here been so prohibit ##ively strange that you ' ve just decided not to come into work at all ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . i ' m not , ' ' i st ##am ##mer , ` ` it ' s a really long story , mr . [SEP]
[CLS] cooper . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m listening , ' ' he says , training his eyes on me . [SEP]
[CLS] i look over at emerson , who nods for me to go on . [SEP]
[CLS] i draw a deep breath and continue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i probably should have mentioned this right after my interview , ' ' i begin , meeting cooper ' s steady gaze , ` ` but emerson and i are n ' t exactly strangers . [SEP]
[CLS] we , uh , know each other from high school , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] and when i ran into him that first day , even after our interview went so well , i was going to turn down the job because of that . [SEP]
[CLS] i was afraid things might be . . . difficult . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you know each other from when you were kids , ' ' cooper replies , ` ` why would that mean you had to turn down the job ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we did n ' t just know each other , ' ' emerson cuts in , ` ` we were . . . our parents were together , for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] they were even married , for a very short time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper ' s eyes cloud over as he looks back and forth between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but the talk in the office has been . . . and you showed up here together this morning . . . ' ' he blu ##sters , looking more disturbed by the second , ` ` i was under the impression that there was some sort of romantic relationship happening between you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] for once , even emerson is silent as we stare at cooper . [SEP]
[CLS] our boss shakes his head , unable or unwilling to put the pieces together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ca n ' t be seeing each other , then . [SEP]
[CLS] not if your parents - ' ' ` ` it ' s complicated , ' ' i say quietly , my fingernails digging into my palms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not the word i would have used , ' ' cooper sc ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hey , ' ' emerson jumps in , ` ` you do n ' t have all the details , cooper . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and believe me , i do n ' t want them , ' ' our boss says quickly , shoving a hand through his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what i want is for you two to tell me what the hell i ' m supposed to do , here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , his jaw tens ##ing angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , i have a new employee who ca n ' t seem to show up for work , a senior employee who ' s more interested in carrying on some per ##verted relationship with his steps ##ister than pulling his weight , and an office full of people who ca n ' t talk about anything but the two of you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper ran ##ts furiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cry out , as he lung ##es to his feet and towers over cooper ' s desk . [SEP]
[CLS] in an instant , it ' s like he ' s eighteen again , facing off against his torment ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] his entire body is alive with powerful rage , and i ' m truly afraid of what he might do next . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you dare pre ##sume to judge me , ' ' emerson growls . [SEP]
[CLS] i watch as cooper ' s eyes bug out of his head in alarm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get out of my face , sawyer ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] our boss cries , shrinking back into his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know the first thing about my life , ' ' emerson rage ##s on , shaking , ` ` abby is the best thing that ' s ever happened to me , and i ' m not going to let you shit on what we have . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] cooper shoots back , ` ` you two go off and live in whatever kind of sin you prefer , just do n ' t do it under my nose ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you trying to fire me , cooper ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson growls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t fire you . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re under contract . [SEP]
[CLS] and all of the partners need to agree before terminating someone , ' ' cooper says , exasperated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' d strongly suggest that you consider - ' ' ` ` i quit , ' ' emerson cuts him off , pushing roughly away from the desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great , ' ' cooper shouts , ` ` good idea , sawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] just walk away from the agency because you ' re caught up on a piece of ass . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my vision flashes bright white as my boss ' s words sink in . [SEP]
[CLS] before emerson can launch himself across the desk at cooper , i leap to my feet and block his path . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare down at cooper , the corners of my vision blur ##ring with rage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am not some piece of ass , ' ' i say , my voice clear and strong , ` ` i was almost the best graphic designer you ever had . [SEP]
[CLS] but you blew it . [SEP]
[CLS] if emerson goes , i go too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' cooper see ##thes , looking back and forth between us , ` ` just get out before i call security on both your ass ##es . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problem , ' ' emerson says , grabbing my hand . [SEP]
[CLS] we storm out the door together , our shoulders squared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good luck , you two , ' ' cooper calls sarcastically after us as we march across the community work space . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` enjoy your inc ##est ##uous little cab ##al while you can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] our cow ##or ##kers rubber ##neck to get a better view of us as we pass , but one with ##ering look from emerson and they all pry their eyes away . [SEP]
[CLS] we charge down the stairs and back out into the light of day . [SEP]
[CLS] just a few days ago , i was walking into this office and landing my dream job . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson was one of the most important people in this agency . [SEP]
[CLS] and now here we are , out on our ass ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] and all because we tried to make a go of being together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' emerson says through gritted teeth , ` ` guess i was wrong about overs ##lee ##ping not being a big deal , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i open my mouth to answer , but the ringing of my cell phone interrupt ##s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i snatch the device out of my purse and see that riley is calling . [SEP]
[CLS] after her dozens of texts and calls over the course of last night , i figure i ' d better at least answer once . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ri , it ' s really not a good time , ' ' i say into the phone , turning away from emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah , tell me something i do n ' t know , ' ' she replies , sounding panicked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where the hell are you , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m at work , ' ' i tell her , ` ` or . . . the place that was work for a second , at least . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s going on , riley ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you ok ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been trying to call you all night , ' ' she hu ##rries on , ` ` abby , there were some papers delivered to the apartment last night from your grandparents ' lawyer . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re kicking us out of the apartment , effective immediately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , nearly voice ##less with shock . [SEP]
[CLS] this ca n ' t be happening . [SEP]
[CLS] not right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` apparently they were n ' t kidding when they said you had to choose between them and emerson , ' ' she goes on , ` ` they had n ' t heard from you , so they ' re kicking us out . [SEP]
[CLS] unless you assure them that emerson wo n ' t be a part of your life , that is . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m silent for a long moment , just watching as the other people on the sidewalk pass me by . [SEP]
[CLS] then , for lack of a rational response , i start to laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] wildly . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson looks at me as if i ' ve sp ##routed a second head , but his confusion only sets me off further . [SEP]
[CLS] this ca n ' t all be happening to me . [SEP]
[CLS] and yet , here it all is , landing in my lap in a heap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you totally lost it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley asks me over the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s possible , ' ' i ca ##ckle , gripping my sides , ` ` it ' s very possible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i should have known better than to feel sunny about my twenty - sixth year . [SEP]
[CLS] in a matter of hours , i ' ve managed to lose my new job , my apartment , and the only family i have left . [SEP]
[CLS] every stable thing i ' ve muscled into place has disappeared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , as i let the phone drop from my ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we head home now and talk all this out ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` home , ' ' i repeat , my voice going hollow on me , ` ` i do n ' t think i have one of those anymore , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his brow fur ##row ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been evicted . [SEP]
[CLS] by my grandparents , ' ' i tell him , wondering at the statement even as it leaves my lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand . [SEP]
[CLS] why would they do something like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , outraged on my behalf . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re their granddaughter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cooper is n ' t the only one who di ##sa ##pp ##rove ##s of us being together , ' ' i reply , ` ` my grandparents forbid me from seeing you after the other night . [SEP]
[CLS] they said i could either be a part of their lives , or a part of yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i watch the news sink into emerson ' s mind . [SEP]
[CLS] his outrage soft ##ens as he understands what i ' ve sacrificed for him . [SEP]
[CLS] and why losing my job now is such a huge deal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . [SEP]
[CLS] you can borrow my home , then , ' ' he says , the hardness draining from his voice as he dr ##apes an arm over my shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything ' s going to be ok . ' ' i let him guide me back through the lower east side . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel shell - shocked , blinds ##ided . [SEP]
[CLS] like every bit of context organizing my life has fallen away all at once . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least , every bit of context besides emerson himself . [SEP]
[CLS] for now , just having him by my side is enough . [SEP]
[CLS] we can figure out the rest along the way . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter seventeen after i ' ve made sure that riley is n ' t going to be left out in the cold tonight , i settle in for a long , be ##fu ##ddled evening at emerson ' s place . [SEP]
[CLS] the hours creep past as i try to process everything that ' s happened , and what i ' m supposed to do now . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i are both out of a job , i ' m out of a home , and he ' s bound for europe at the end of the week . [SEP]
[CLS] so much for that bright , shiny future i ' d been so optimistic about . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson spends about an hour on the phone with cooper and the other bas ##tian partners when we get back to his loft . [SEP]
[CLS] they argue inc ##ess ##antly , trying to hammer out a truce . [SEP]
[CLS] no one at that company wants to see emerson leave , least of all emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] but with everything that went down between him and cooper this afternoon , i do n ' t see what other choice there is . [SEP]
[CLS] for my part , i spend the better part of the afternoon absent ##mind ##edly patting ro ##xie ' s head and trying to work up the nerve to call my grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] surely , they ' re just bluff ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] they do n ' t actually expect me to bend to their will and never see emerson again . [SEP]
[CLS] or do they ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' emerson sighs , emerging from his bedroom having hung up on the hour long conference call . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' ve backed off the whole firing - me front . [SEP]
[CLS] now it ' s just a matter of whether or not i want to back off the i - quit front . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , as he sits down beside me , ` ` what do you think you ' re going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for starters , ' ' he says , brushing a lock of hair out of my face , ` ` i ' m going to open another bottle of wine . [SEP]
[CLS] helps me think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he offers me his hand and pulls me off the couch , towing me back to the kitchen island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you talked to your grandparents yet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks me , selecting a bottle of mer ##lot to start with . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' i say faintly , burying my face in my hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know what the hell i ' d even say to them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` say they ' re a couple of asshole ##s who should fuck right off , ' ' emerson shrugs , fetch ##ing a wine opener . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want them to fuck off , ' ' i ex ##claim , ` ` they ' re my family , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] why ca n ' t you understand that that ' s important to me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe because i know just how badly family can mess you up , ' ' he replies , popping out the cork . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think i do n ' t know that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do , you seem to have forgotten , ' ' he remarks , taking two wine glasses down from the cupboard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i ' m just not ready to give up on my family so easily , ' ' i say without thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson pauses with his back to me , his shoulders going stiff . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is that supposed to mean , abby ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his voice death ##ly quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just that i ' ve never been the type of person who cuts and runs on the people who care about her , ' ' i say , wave ##ring in my stance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i am ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , ira ##te as he turns to face me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was my mother ' s nurse for years while my father was away . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d probably still be taking care of her if she ' d ever gotten well enough for out ##patient treatment again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , emerson , ' ' i say , ed ##ging away from his rage . [SEP]
[CLS] after the flare of anger i saw go through him at the office today , i do n ' t want to provoke him any further . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` for fuck ' s sake , i had to raise my mother , rather than have her raise me , ' ' emerson fu ##mes , clutching the edge of the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] his knuckles go white with the force of his grip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t mean to upset you , ' ' i tell him , trying to keep my voice calm , ` ` i know how much you sacrificed for your mom . [SEP]
[CLS] but you know better than anyone how painful it is , having your family not be there for you . [SEP]
[CLS] cutting my grandparents out of my life should be easy , but it ' s not for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not like they ' re giving you much of a choice , ' ' emerson says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just have to figure out a way to get through to them , ' ' i say shaking my head , ` ` without this job , i ' m going to need a place to stay , at least for a little while . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a place to stay , ' ' emerson replies quiz ##zic ##ally , ` ` right here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you ' re letting me stay here tonight , ' ' i tell him , ` ` but i mean long term , emerson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i mean long term too , abby , ' ' he shoots back , his anger fading to determination . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask him , ` ` you ' re not even staying here long term . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going back to london at the end of the week . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only if i decide to keep my job at bas ##tian , ' ' he says . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him , jaw hanging out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not seriously considering quit ##ting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , ` ` that job is once - in - a - lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] bas ##tian is the best in the field . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t walk away from that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure i can , ' ' he challenges me , stepping around the island toward me , ` ` after the way cooper di ##sr ##es ##pe ##cted us this morning ? [SEP]
[CLS] why would i want to stay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' i say , ` ` no , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t leave that agency on my account . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demands , placing his hands on my hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because , ' ' i sp ##lu ##tter , staring up at him , ` ` i ca n ' t . . . that ' s too much pressure ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t be responsible for you losing your job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m responsible for you losing yours , ' ' he points out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yeah . [SEP]
[CLS] but , ' ' i st ##am ##mer , resting my hands on his firm chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was doing perfectly well before bas ##tian hired me , ' ' emerson says , ` ` i can do perfectly well without them now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what if you start res ##enting me ? [SEP]
[CLS] you know . . . for making you leave ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , unable to meet his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would never happen , ' ' he says , turning my face toward his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know that , ' ' i insist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes i do , ' ' he says , his eyes flashing angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know myself , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] i know what i care about . [SEP]
[CLS] and what i care about above all is you . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to work for any company that does n ' t value you as much as i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then what are we supposed to do , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , taking a step away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything we want ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##claim ##s , ` ` i have enough money saved up from my first few app sales to last us two lifetime ##s ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m just supposed to be content , living off your money ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask arch ##ly , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remember how well that worked for my dad ? [SEP]
[CLS] and your mom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s not the same thing , ' ' he says stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t see any difference , ' ' i say , shaking my head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my dad never had any pride in himself , because he just lived off his parents ' money his whole life . [SEP]
[CLS] i was already headed down that road with my grandparents , but bas ##tian was finally going to get me on my own two feet . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to find another job , another way to be independent , not another meal ticket . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that what i ' d be to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks heated ##ly , ` ` a meal ticket ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course not ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i cry , ` ` i love you , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] i loved you when you were a penn ##ile ##ss eighteen - year - old and i love you now ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what the fuck are we arguing about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shouts , slamming his fist down on the island . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s just money , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] it does n ' t mean anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it - ' ' ` ` it means nothing , ' ' he insists , ` ` you sharing my life , my resources , would n ' t mean that you were bound to me , or that you owed me anything . [SEP]
[CLS] it would n ' t mean i had power over you , it would just mean . . . that you we here . [SEP]
[CLS] with me . [SEP]
[CLS] that we were in this together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` emerson , i do n ' t . . . ' ' i whisper , trying to wrap my head around what he ' s suggesting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know how to think of money as anything but a bargaining chip . [SEP]
[CLS] my family - ' ' ` ` your family is fucked up , pardon my saying , ' ' he cuts me off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your grandparents use their money as a weapon . [SEP]
[CLS] but me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d like to use mine as a gift . [SEP]
[CLS] a way out , for both of us . [SEP]
[CLS] why wo n ' t you let me do that for you ? [SEP]
[CLS] for us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just . . . i ' m sorry . . . ' ' i say , trying to blink back the tears that have sprung to my eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just need to think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' emerson says , his jaw set . [SEP]
[CLS] he turns on his heel , storms across the loft , and grabs up a re ##tra ##ctable leash from the side table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know i should just be some alpha man idiot and storm out into the wind or whatever the fuck , but ro ##xie needs a walk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the west ##ie goes gallo ##ping over to emerson when he whistle ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson attache ##s the leash to her collar and looks up at me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll give you some time to think everything over . [SEP]
[CLS] have some wine if you like . [SEP]
[CLS] if you want to leave before i get back and find some other way . . . i wo n ' t hold it against you . [SEP]
[CLS] just make up your mind , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] you know what i want . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before i can say another word , he wren ##ches open the front door and disappears with ro ##xie on his heels . [SEP]
[CLS] i fall back against the kitchen island , letting the baffled tears stream down my face . [SEP]
[CLS] with shaking hands , i fish out a bottle of cab ##ern ##et from the stock ##pile . [SEP]
[CLS] pouring myself a very tall glass , i let my warring thoughts pour out through my mind as well . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson is willing to leave his job and share everything he has with me . [SEP]
[CLS] i , on the other hand , have no choice but to abandon my job at bas ##tian , have no place to live , and hardly any money to my name . [SEP]
[CLS] if he and i were to start a life together now , i ' d be bringing nothing to the table . [SEP]
[CLS] shuddering ##ly , i remember how i felt about de ##b when she showed up on the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought she was desperate , and mani ##pu ##lative , and a helpless dependent . [SEP]
[CLS] how would what emerson is proposing make me any different from her ? [SEP]
[CLS] as much as i hate to admit it , i ' ve been living off the generosity of my family for my whole life so far . [SEP]
[CLS] sure , i worked hard to get into a good college and paid most of my tuition with scholarships , but i have privilege coming out the wa ##zoo . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , what - i ' m just going to marry rich and have that be that ? [SEP]
[CLS] how am i supposed to live with myself if i go down that path ? [SEP]
[CLS] i have to earn my own way through life . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s what i ' ve always wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a huge gulp of wine and feel it go straight to my head via my empty stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] getting trash ##ed is not the solution here , but i have no other brilliant ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish that i had someone to talk about all of this . [SEP]
[CLS] riley ' s probably furious with me for getting us evicted , and it ' s not like i ' m going to call my grandparents up . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s times like this when i most keen ##ly feel the loss of my mother . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish more than anything that she was here for me to talk to . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d be able to help me through this mess . [SEP]
[CLS] but of course , that ' s just a dream . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m all alone in this , as ever . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , self , ' ' i mutter , raising the wine glass to the empty apartment , ` ` it ' s just you and me again . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s figure out what we ' re going to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i nearly lose my balance on the bar stool as a loud knocking rings out from the front entry way . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s weird . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson just left five minutes ago , and besides , he has a key . [SEP]
[CLS] we did n ' t order any food , and there ' s no way riley ' s swinging by to say hello after what i ' ve done to her . [SEP]
[CLS] so then who could possibly be knocking at this hour ? [SEP]
[CLS] cr ##ad ##ling my wine glass , i stand and cross to the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] probably it ' s just emerson ' s dry cleaning , or something . [SEP]
[CLS] billionaire ##s have things like dry cleaning delivery , right ? [SEP]
[CLS] i step into the entry ##way and unlock the front door , swinging it open with my free hand . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a man standing on emerson ' s front steps . [SEP]
[CLS] he wears a dated but clean sport coat , a fair amount of stubble , and sc ##uf ##fed shoes that must once have been very expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands are clasped nervously in front of him , and his hunched shoulders give him a look of pre ##em ##ptive defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] there are red sp ##lot ##ches across his nose and cheeks , signature features of an alcoholic . [SEP]
[CLS] the man is staring at shoes , and for a moment i ca n ' t place him . [SEP]
[CLS] but then , he lifts his face to me , and i feel the wind rush out of my lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i breathe , paralyzed in the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello abigail , ' ' he replies with heartbreak ##ing formal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope this is n ' t a bad time . [SEP]
[CLS] well . [SEP]
[CLS] i know it is , but . . . can i come in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , ' ' i tell him , stepping aside to let him in . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad shuffle ##s past me into emerson ' s loft , looking as frail as i ' ve ever seen him . [SEP]
[CLS] i stare after him , utterly baffled by his sudden appearance here . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t seen him since my masters program graduation ceremony , and even then he barely said hello before disappearing into thin air again . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s not exactly an active presence in my life , so what the hell is he doing here , on one of the most intense nights of my life ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad , ' ' i begin , watching as he stands awkwardly in the middle of emerson ' s loft , ` ` why are you here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] they told me what was going on , ' ' he mutter ##s , ` ` i figured you might be in a tough spot , so i thought i ' d come and try to . . . i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but how did you even find this place ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your friend . [SEP]
[CLS] roommate . [SEP]
[CLS] she mentioned you were with emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] this address was n ' t too hard to find , ' ' he shrugs . [SEP]
[CLS] i take a nervous sip of wine and immediately feel horrible for doing so as my dad shifts uncomfortably . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i should n ' t , ' ' i murmur , setting down my wine glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s ok , ' ' dad assure ##s me , ` ` i ' ve been sober for a solid six months . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i bite my lip . [SEP]
[CLS] six months is always about how long he lasts between re ##la ##pse ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t want to set him off . [SEP]
[CLS] what i do want is to understand what possessed my father to track me down tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] we have n ' t had a real conversation in years . [SEP]
[CLS] really , not since his falling out with de ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] his endless cycle of re ##la ##pse ##s and recover ##ies has broken him own . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks fee ##ble , now . [SEP]
[CLS] broken . [SEP]
[CLS] i hate to see him like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i prompt him , ` ` are you here to save me from the evil emerson sawyer ? [SEP]
[CLS] are you going to tell me that grandma and grandpa are right , and that i should steer clear of him if i know what ' s good for me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' my dad replies , shoving his hands into his pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i reply , taken aback . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but - ' ' ` ` i ' m not here to save you from emerson , ' ' my dad goes on , ` ` i ' m here to save you - try and save you - from yourself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re go ##n na have to drop a few more bread cr ##umb ##s if you expect me to follow this , ' ' i tell him , crossing my arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know this is going to sound insane , coming from me , ' ' my dad says , struggling with his heart - to - heart dynamic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but when your grandpa told me what the situation was , it ' s like i knew what you ' d be thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' d be thinking , ' i should just give up on emerson , ' and ' it ' s too hard , ' and ' it ' s not right to let someone help me , i need to go it alone ' . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i stare at him across the room , flu ##mm ##ox ##ed by how spot - on he is . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad and i have never once understood each other . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s never even made the attempt to understand my experiences . [SEP]
[CLS] we do n ' t talk . [SEP]
[CLS] we especially do n ' t listen . [SEP]
[CLS] but here he is now , speaking to what i actually have been thinking and feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] what the hell am i supposed to do with that ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad . . . ' ' i say slowly , ` ` are you telling me that i should stay with emerson ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i am , ' ' he says , as if surprised by the conclusion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you hate emerson , ' ' i remind him , ` ` you two nearly killed each other that day - ' ' ` ` please , ' ' dad says , holding up his hands for me stop , ` ` let ' s not go there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' i back ##tra ##ck , ` ` i ' m just a little confused , here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never knew how to do right by you , abby , ' ' my dad says quietly , lifting his eyes to mind , ` ` but that ' s not your fault . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s on me . [SEP]
[CLS] when you were growing up , i never gave your needs the same weight as mine . [SEP]
[CLS] never thought about how things would effect you . [SEP]
[CLS] i was totally blinds ##ided by how much emerson came to mean to you back then . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t even stop to consider how wonderful it was that you ' d found someone you could talk to , share things with . [SEP]
[CLS] god knows i was n ' t helping you on that front . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t say that , ' ' i reply , a knot forming in my throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve always loved you , dad . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to know that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i love you , ' ' he says , crossing the room tentatively toward me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve just been pretty terrible at letting you know that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with great care , dad takes my hands in his . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks at me intently , and for the first time in my life i feel like he ' s actually seeing me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` abby , ' ' he says , ` ` do you love emerson as much as you did when you were a kid ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' i whisper hoarse ##ly , ` ` i love him so much more , now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then do n ' t run away , ' ' he says , squeezing my hands , ` ` stay and work through this with him . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t refuse him out of pride , or some idea of prop ##riety . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s ok to let people help you . [SEP]
[CLS] especially the people who love you more than anything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what if something goes wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask earnest ##ly , ` ` what if we start to res ##ent each other , or feel tied down , or change our minds - ' ' ` ` then at least you ' ll know for sure where you stand , ' ' my dad cuts me off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you ' ve been in pain since you and emerson were forced apart . [SEP]
[CLS] it was my fault that happened . [SEP]
[CLS] mine and de ##b ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] but can you honestly tell me you have n ' t spent the past decade wondering what would have happened between you and emerson ' if only ' ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let you spend the next ten years wondering . [SEP]
[CLS] hurting . [SEP]
[CLS] i need you to hear me now , abby . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear you , ' ' i tell him , and it ' s true . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know it ' s scary , sweetheart , ' ' dad says , resting his hands on my shoulders , ` ` but you ' ve got to jump , now . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , ' ' i whisper , ` ` ok , dad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ok , you ' ll jump ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he presses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll jump , ' ' i tell him , ` ` but i may fall , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s always that chance , ' ' he says sadly , ` ` trust me , i know . [SEP]
[CLS] but you know what ' ll happen if you do n ' t fall ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll fly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he kisses my forehead and wraps his arms around me . [SEP]
[CLS] i hug him back , ferocious ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] i think this might be the first honest moment we ' ve ever shared together . [SEP]
[CLS] and all i had to do was let my life get almost entirely der ##ailed to bring it about . [SEP]
[CLS] life ' s funny , is n ' t it ? [SEP]
[CLS] my dad and i both look up as the front door swings open and a small bundle of fur bounds into the loft . [SEP]
[CLS] ro ##xie runs right up to me , w ##hin ##y with delight to find me still here . [SEP]
[CLS] when emerson steps into the loft after her , the same look of relief floods his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was worried i ' d be gone by now . [SEP]
[CLS] that relief gives way to surprise as he recognizes my dad standing next to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bob ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson says , looking back and forth between us . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , emerson , ' ' my dad replies , going to shake emerson ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry to drop in una ##nn ##oun ##ced , i just needed to have a word with my daughter . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh . [SEP]
[CLS] sure , ' ' emerson says , giving my dad ' s hand a firm shake . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you guys have a lot to talk about . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get out of your hair , ' ' dad says . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but , emerson . . . i know i have no right to ask anything of you , given how i ' ve treated you in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just - be good to her . [SEP]
[CLS] be better to her than i ever was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i intend to be , ' ' emerson says , training his eyes on my dad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever she decides that means to her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] my dad smiles , faintly but res ##ol ##ute ##ly , gives me a final wave , and sees himself out . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson and i stare after him as the door closes quietly in his wake . [SEP]
[CLS] for a moment , the only movement in the room comes from ro ##xie ' s ex ##uber ##ant tail - wa ##gging . [SEP]
[CLS] when emerson finally swings his gaze my way , his eyes are full of cautious hope . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . ' ' he begins , ` ` did your dad have any good advice ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh softly , ` ` he really did . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did that advice involve getting as far away from me as human ##ly possible ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , taking a step forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not at all , ' ' i tell him , counter ##ing his step , ` ` in fact , it was just the opposite . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` huh , ' ' emerson replies , as we slowly move toward each other in a dance of barely - contained desire . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that mean . . . you ' ve come to some kind of decision ? [SEP]
[CLS] about what you want to do happen next ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it means that i ' m ready to ask for what i ' ve wanted for the last ten years , ' ' i reply , as we meet in the center of the loft . [SEP]
[CLS] i take his hands , take a breath , and take that final leap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to be with you , emerson . [SEP]
[CLS] now and always . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that what we have is unconventional , and that it ' s not going to be an easy journey . [SEP]
[CLS] but there ' s no one else i ' d rather be on my journey with . [SEP]
[CLS] so if you ' ll still have me , i ' d like to stay here . [SEP]
[CLS] with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if i ' ll still have you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson breathe ##s , taking me into his arms , ` ` i ' d give up everything to still have you in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i ' m suggesting that as a game plan , but . . . ' ' ` ` we ' re really going to do this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , wrapping my arms around his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are , ' ' he replies , circling my waist , ` ` no one can stop us , abby . [SEP]
[CLS] not like before . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no one we need to apologize to , nothing we have to explain . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re free . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i press myself to him , bringing my lips to his . [SEP]
[CLS] our kiss is searing , binding , full of promise and hope . [SEP]
[CLS] ro ##xie runs circles around us as our mouths move together , making up for lost time . [SEP]
[CLS] i grin as i kiss him , happy tears running down my cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] as we finally break apart , emerson brushes a lock of hair behind my ear , gazing at me with great purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s just one last thing we have to figure out , then , ' ' he says , his voice ras ##ping with emotion as he takes my right hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i ask , wiping the tears away . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks down at my hand , rubbing his thumb over the single pearl g ##lim ##mering on my finger . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel my breath catch in my throat as i guess his meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you rather be wearing this . . . on the other hand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , his blue eyes gleaming as they drink me in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you . . . do you mean . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i st ##am ##mer , all my composure going right out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson ' s face breaks into a gorgeous grin as he slowly lowers himself onto one knee before me . [SEP]
[CLS] i laugh with con ##founded el ##ation as he slips the pearl ring off my right hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asks , holding the ring up to me . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i say . . . let ' s jump , ' ' i breathe , staring down at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his smile grows imp ##oss ##ibly wide as he slides the band onto my left ring finger . [SEP]
[CLS] turns out that i chose my engagement ring when i was just seventeen years old . [SEP]
[CLS] and you know what ? [SEP]
[CLS] i chose the person i wanted to share my life with when i was seventeen , too . [SEP]
[CLS] it just took us both a while to realize it . [SEP]
[CLS] emerson stands and scoop ##s me up into his arms as we both burst into ec ##static laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] this has to be the least conventional relationship anyone ' s ever heard of , but it ' s ours . [SEP]
[CLS] no one can take us away from each other , no one else gets the final say . [SEP]
[CLS] but there is one last thing i have to ask him , now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to take me to bed now or what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grin , running my hands along his imp ##ec ##ca ##bly cut chest . [SEP]
[CLS] he slips an arm under my knees , and carries me toward the bedroom like a bride on her wedding night . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re getting a bit ahead of ourselves , maybe . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ' ve always done things out of order , emerson and i . [SEP]
[CLS] only now are we catching up to where we left off at eighteen . [SEP]
[CLS] but if there ' s one thing i ' m sure of now , after all these years , is that what we have has always - always - been worth the wait . [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue one year later . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i push down on the top of the french press and pour the delicious - smelling coffee into three generous mug ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] two excited voices ban ##ter behind me , and i turn toward them with a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here we are , ' ' i say , setting the three mug ##s down on the kitchen island , ` ` we ca n ' t plot brilliant business strategy without coffee . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that , my dear , is a fact , ' ' riley says , grateful ##ly taking her cup . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , here , ' ' emerson replies , grabbing one for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] i settle down at the island beside them . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire surface is covered with outlines , graphs , and ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] a flu ##rry of excited butterflies rally around my stomach as i look over all our hard work . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is really happening , is n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] i grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure is , ' ' riley replies , ` ` you guys are ready to launch . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just have one more feature i want to add to the app , and we ' ll be golden , ' ' emerson says , stepping my way and slipping his arm around my slender waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you feeling good , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] founding partner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good and ready , mr . [SEP]
[CLS] founding partner , ' ' i laugh , cl ##inking my coffee mug to his . [SEP]
[CLS] for the past year , emerson and i have been hard at work developing a suite of new applications to take the world by storm . [SEP]
[CLS] the suite will be the center ##piece and first project of our two - person creative collective : tree ##house . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re the founding partners , ceo ##s , and only employees - save for our pr consultant , riley , and our de facto mascot , ro ##xie . [SEP]
[CLS] but though we may be small , i feel very good about our operation . [SEP]
[CLS] our first batch of apps is targeted at friends and family of people struggling with substance abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] there are resources , information , and support available through this modest suite of applications . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s even a way for individuals to get in touch with each other , share the burden of living with and loving someone who ' s self - des ##tructing . [SEP]
[CLS] basically , it ' s everything emerson and i wish we had as kids , everything we were eventually able to give each other . . . only in app form . [SEP]
[CLS] hey , it ' s 2015 , after all . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all you need to do is press ' publish ' and you ' ll be good to go ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley says excitedly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like to do the honors ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] emerson asks , sliding a tablet my way with the suite of apps pulled up , ready to be launched . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll do it together , ' ' i say , taking his hand in mine . [SEP]
[CLS] i feel his wedding band brush against my hand and get a little thrill . [SEP]
[CLS] we only just said ` ` i do ' ' at a small city hall ceremony last month , so seeing his wedding band is still new . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` together , ' ' emerson agrees , ` ` naturally . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get on with it , love ##birds ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] riley says excitedly , ` ` i want to put out the press release ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with hands clasped , emerson and i each lower a finger to the ` ` big red button , ' ' and introduce the world to our latest idea . [SEP]
[CLS] after months of tire ##less effort , it feels wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] there may have been a time when starting my own business , launching a brand new product , and subject ##ing myself to the crazy world of the internet may have been terrifying . [SEP]
[CLS] but as i look up at emerson , i realize that i ' ve already taken the biggest , best risk of my life . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing can stop me now . [SEP]
[CLS] scratch that , i think , as emerson scoop ##s me up into a ce ##le ##bra ##tory kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing can stop us , now . [SEP]
[CLS] the end chapter 1 the sun was hot and the humidity within the city was oppressive . [SEP]
[CLS] the moist air caused the traffic pollution to mix with the scents of the restaurants and the other odor ##s that were distinctly city oriented to hove ##r in the air , pressing down on the occupants as if it were a heavy blanket with no hope of re ##lent ##ing any time soon . [SEP]
[CLS] just like that first day , victoria phillips thought to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] the ho ##rri ##fying thought startled her and she stopped in her tracks , terrified of those memories . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said out loud and shivered , not wanting any of those feelings to come back into her mind now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is ridiculous ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed herself harder , walking as if a demon were on her back in an effort to reach the school where she was a guidance counselor for an elementary school . [SEP]
[CLS] why was she thinking about that day again ? [SEP]
[CLS] five years ago , she ' d worked hard to eliminate all that pain from her system . [SEP]
[CLS] why was it coming back now ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was late , she told herself , just like that morning so long ago and she was rushing . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked around , searching for a long , dark car that would indicate that the past was going to repeat itself . [SEP]
[CLS] when she saw the car parked in front of the school , her steps faltered and her breath caught in her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] it could n ' t be ! [SEP]
[CLS] blinking hard , she opened her eyes once again and stared in front of her , sure that her eyes were playing tricks on her . [SEP]
[CLS] but the elegant limousine did n ' t disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] it sat there , ominous ##ly mocking her as if it were a giant snake about to reach out and attack her with a venom ##ous bite . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost dropped her bag and ran the other way . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain ripping through her heart was almost as intense as it had been that day five years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] when a tall , dark man with a muscular frame got out of the car , she gasped as the painful memories came flooding back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , there he was . [SEP]
[CLS] and , imp ##oss ##ibly , he was bigger and more handsome than she remembered him . [SEP]
[CLS] five years earlier a taxi sped by , his horn b ##lar ##ing at some perceived offense , then drove past , leaving the smell of exhaust per ##me ##ating the earth in its wake . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria pulled her thick brown hair off her neck , wishing she ' d taken a few more minutes that morning to pin up the heavy curtain of soft , brown curls . [SEP]
[CLS] but after spending most of the previous night in the library studying , she had n ' t wanted to wake up early enough to take the time to do anything more than shower and change before heading off to her morning classes . [SEP]
[CLS] her green , almond shaped eyes looked up at the sky , noting the red disk of the sun . [SEP]
[CLS] that was never a good sign , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered her father ' s saying , ` ` red sun at night , sailor ' s delight . [SEP]
[CLS] red sun in morning , sailor ' s take warning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] what warning they would take , she was n ' t sure . [SEP]
[CLS] he never went farther than just quoting the phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] she suspected that it meant they would have a hot , humid , awful day . [SEP]
[CLS] just like today was starting out to be . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her hair over her shoulder , trying to give her back some relief from the heat . [SEP]
[CLS] since she ' d been so rushed earlier , she was paying the price since her hair was sticking to her neck and her sun ##dre ##ss , which had seemed such a pretty , lively and more importantly , cool , choice earlier in the day . [SEP]
[CLS] the dress was unfortunately covering her legs which could be the grateful recipient of what little breeze was available if she ' d chosen her normal choice of shorts and a tee - shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##fting her heavy bag of books more securely onto her shoulder , she hurried on to her class , wishing she did n ' t have to travel so far through london . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , her tiny dorm room was on the opposite side of the campus from her class and there was nothing to do for it but walk faster or be late . [SEP]
[CLS] she was hurrying with her head bowed low in an effort to keep the sun off her face and out of her eyes so she did n ' t see the limousine pull up beside the tall building . [SEP]
[CLS] out of the corner of her eye , she saw a door open and a tall man get out , surrounded by other men who were shorter , but scar ##ier looking . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , even those ne ##bu ##lous thoughts did n ' t enter into her mind quickly enough . [SEP]
[CLS] she was walking too fast with a book bag that was too heavy , leaving her off balance so when the men started walking into the building , she was n ' t able to stop herself fast enough . [SEP]
[CLS] as if in slow motion , victoria saw her bag slip from her shoulder , then the arm swing wide , knocking her chin and tossing her to her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] the sudden burst of pain came from several directions all at once . [SEP]
[CLS] she could feel the cement dig into the soft skin of her knees as she slid across the rough surface , then the pain entered the palms of her hands as she tried to keep her face from a similar fate as her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] both palms were subjected to the same rough surface but even that was n ' t her primary pain . [SEP]
[CLS] her jaw was suddenly aching as if it had been lit on fire , then the throbbing told her that she ' d been hit for some bizarre reason . [SEP]
[CLS] her confused eyes looked around , trying to identify the source and reason for the strike but nothing in the world made sense to her pain - fog ##ged brain . [SEP]
[CLS] as all of these sensations were tall ##ied in her brain , a distant crying sound penetrated and that was the only issue she was able to deal with at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] looking around , her eyes searched for and found the little girl who was now clinging to her mother ' s leg . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stood up , ignoring the pain that shot through her hands , knees and face with the effort . [SEP]
[CLS] going over to the little girl , she smiled , battling the sharp stab of pain from her jaw and bent down to the child ' s level . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry , sweetheart , ' ' victoria said calmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m okay . [SEP]
[CLS] are you hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] the mother also bent down to reassure her daughter and after several moments , the two of them were able to calm the child enough so that she was smiling again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s your name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , when the child had overcome her crying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lucy , ' ' the girl said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lucy , i hope you have a very nice rest of the day and i think you are sweet to be concerned for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the little girl , who had to be no more than five or six years old , reached out a chu ##bby hand and gently touched victoria ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does it hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she noticed the little girl looking over victoria ' s shoulder shy ##ly but she kept her attention solely on lucy and her anxiety . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was n ' t sure who was behind her and hid her curiosity well from lucy , preferring to deal with one problem at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not really . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m made of pretty tough stuff , ' ' she said , grinning broadly for lucy ' s benefit . [SEP]
[CLS] the mother smiled at victoria , then at her daughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? [SEP]
[CLS] everything is okay . [SEP]
[CLS] are you ready to go home to see daddy ? [SEP]
[CLS] he should be back by now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lucy smiled , eager to see her father and obviously relieved that no one was hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] the child took her mother ' s hand and continued with their walk home , obviously eager to tell her father about their incident of the day . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria heard the small child chatter ##ing away but the only words that she was able to understand were ` ` scary men ' ' before she was out of hearing distance . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stood up and all the pain she ' d been pushing to the back of her brain came rushing forward . [SEP]
[CLS] her knees , palms and especially her face were suddenly on fire and she wanted to melt down into the cement and lean her sore body against the building . [SEP]
[CLS] but she knew that the little girl was n ' t the only one that needed re ##ass ##urance and she forced herself to find the inner strength to face the other audience . [SEP]
[CLS] turning slowly , she tried to bring up another smile for the strangers she knew where standing behind her , hoping to reassure them so she could stop being a spectacle . [SEP]
[CLS] but the sight that greeted her when she turned around was too much . [SEP]
[CLS] the tall , dark man standing directly behind her , holding her book bag in one hand and reaching for her right hand with the other , was possibly the most handsome man she ' d ever seen , even from the movies . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure you are okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the tall , incredibly gorgeous man asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he was at least six feet three inches tall , towering over the other men around him . [SEP]
[CLS] and although they were bulk ##ier , he was extremely muscular himself . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes were dark , almost black as was his hair which was cut short , barely brushing the collar of his shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s only thought was that he had a lovely accent and spoke perfect english . [SEP]
[CLS] the next thing she knew , she was watching the building swing around her and the sky was blinding her as her mind started spinning , t ##wi ##rling around and her eyes stopped focusing . [SEP]
[CLS] then blackness . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ho ##ku ##m qu ##dam ##a the third , she ##ik of ash ##ir , the most powerful middle eastern country with oil reserves beyond the imagination , found himself at a loss for the first time in his life as the stunning ##ly beautiful woman in front of him slowly started falling to the earth . [SEP]
[CLS] with reflex ##es hon ##ed from long hours in military training and an innate sense that women should be protected at all costs , he caught the faint ##ing woman in his arms , easily lifting her up and cr ##ad ##ling her as his body guards opened the door to the building he had been about to enter only minutes earlier for business meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] as he stared down into her lovely face , he was startled by the perfection of her features . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew her now closed eyes were a sharp , crystal green . [SEP]
[CLS] now that he could no longer see her eyes , he noticed the flawless ##ness of her skin that was pale white now but a moment before had been tinted with peach color on her high cheekbones . [SEP]
[CLS] her eye lashes were long and black as they lay against her skin and he wondered if they were covered in mascara . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t think so . [SEP]
[CLS] they looked natural but too long to be real . [SEP]
[CLS] her hair was incredible , the soft , brown curls falling like a cascade of water almost to the ground as he held her close to his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to run his fingers in the curls just to see if they were really as soft to the touch as they looked but he did n ' t have a free hand at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] shifting her slight weight in his arms , he tried to be the gentleman and not notice her petite figure but he was a man and any male with blood running through his veins would notice her . [SEP]
[CLS] her breasts were large for her small frame but she had a tiny waist and slender hips topping off long , shape ##ly legs . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the kind of figure a woman would spend hours in the gym trying to achieve , he knew . [SEP]
[CLS] pushing thoughts of her physical assets to the side , he lifted her more closely to him , enjoying the way she felt , as if she were meant to be just for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to the hospital , ' ' dh ##ar ##r commanded and all five of his body guards retreated back to either the limousine or the waiting black suv that was parked in front of the building . [SEP]
[CLS] within moments , the limousine was pulled up in front of the emergency room where a doctor was standing by , obviously alerted to the situation by one of the guards ph ##oning ahead and prepared to help in any way he could . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping out of the limousine , he refused to transfer her figure to the waiting gurney . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is wrong with her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r demanded of the doctor who was checking the prone woman ' s pulse and eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t hurt her ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r said when she started to moan softly . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r liked the way she moved , even when coming out of a dead faint . [SEP]
[CLS] she was graceful as her body slowly came back to consciousness and he watched in fascination as those lovely green eyes blinked and focused . [SEP]
[CLS] it was odd that a man with his reputation with women , someone who could , and did , have any woman he desired with the flick of his wrist , was so entrance ##d by this one , young , lovely woman who was n ' t even wearing makeup or designer clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] even so , his body was instantly reacting to hers , app ##re ##cia ##ting the innocent sensual ##ity that she conveyed with her movements . [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor was monitoring her res ##ump ##tion of consciousness and nodded app ##roving ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think she is okay although she has some nasty scrape ##s on her knees . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor stepped back and watched for a moment , carefully checking for any signs of problems as she looked around the sterile emergency room that was cut off from the rest of the area only by a white sheet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` her pulse is normal . [SEP]
[CLS] she probably just stood up too quickly or has n ' t eaten in too long , ' ' he suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria listened to the deep voices around her but tried not to move , afraid that the pain she was feeling in her jaw and legs would int ##ens ##ify . [SEP]
[CLS] all she could understand is that she was in a white room with two men looking down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea how she ' d gotten here or why they were looking so concerned . [SEP]
[CLS] actually , the man who was obviously a doctor if his white coat and ste ##th ##os ##cope were any indication , was not looking concerned any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] but the handsome man beside him was definitely worried . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cr ##oa ##ked , then wondered why her voice was so strange . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain that shot through her jaw when she spoke also was bizarre . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you faint ##ed , ' ' the handsome man replied , moving the doctor out of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , bending down to look at her face , taking her hand in his and checking her pulse himself . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was confused by the concern that was showing in the man ' s eyes but his lips were compressed as if he were angry with her for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she replied , then tried to sit up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine , ' ' she said , but then the di ##zziness came back and she grimaced , trying to keep her head from spinning by placing her hand on her forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she tried to sit up , his hand touched her shoulder , keeping her laying flat on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must relax for another moment . [SEP]
[CLS] no sudden moves until the doctor has said you are okay , ' ' the man replied . [SEP]
[CLS] the heat that went through victoria ' s body when he touched her frightened her enough that she actually sh ##rank back against the bed , unsure of herself and the man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , naturally turning to the taller man who had a commanding presence , giving off an aura of authority that just ignited the air around her . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to smile to give the man the impression she was okay but she was n ' t sure if it worked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re in a hospital , ' ' he explained gently . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t like that word at all . [SEP]
[CLS] hospitals meant money . [SEP]
[CLS] lots of it . [SEP]
[CLS] that was one thing she did n ' t have , being at school on a scholarship . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the hospital ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ye ##lp ##ed , sitting up quickly and eva ##ding the man ' s hand while swinging off the bed on one graceful movement . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the sudden movement had her swaying again and the man ' s hands reached out to steady her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whoa ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , holding onto the bed , praying she would n ' t make a fool of herself again and pass out . [SEP]
[CLS] after several minutes , the room stopped spinning and she was able to make sense of the words being spoken . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` . . . . sit back down , ' ' the tall man was saying firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria turned her attention back to him , a frown on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , looking him up and down as if he were beneath her . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the idea of what a hospital visit would do to her budget was making her a little snap ##pis ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have the money to toss at a series of doctors and needed to leave as soon as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] in her current state of mind , this tall , attractive man was the main hind ##rance from her leaving as quickly as she could . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the expense of the hospital , he was actually ordering her around . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t like that one bit . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t even used to her gentle father giving her orders , she surely was n ' t going to take them from a stranger who thought he was in charge of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who do you think you are ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t take orders from you , sir . [SEP]
[CLS] not even if you were the prince of wales , ' ' she sniffed . [SEP]
[CLS] handsome or not , she hated arrogant men ! [SEP]
[CLS] and this one could give lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was shocked enough to almost smile . [SEP]
[CLS] almost . [SEP]
[CLS] how could a tiny slip of a woman speak to him like this ? [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t she know who he was ? [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor obviously did if the horrified look on his face was any indication . [SEP]
[CLS] surely it was the novelty of the whole situation that amused him . [SEP]
[CLS] he would never permit such conduct otherwise , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r waved the doctor ' s protests aside before they could be spoken . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about something to clean those scrape ##s , ' ' he said , turning to the doctor and interrupting what was probably an explanation as to why the woman should n ' t speak to dh ##ar ##r this way . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , dh ##ar ##r did n ' t want his an ##ony ##mity broken . [SEP]
[CLS] and what dh ##ar ##r wanted , he got . [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor immediately disappeared , leaving the two of them alone . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stared at the man , wondering what to do next . [SEP]
[CLS] she realized that her manners were severely lacking and knew that her mother would be horrified if she did n ' t make amend ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] smiling brightly to the man , she stuck out her hand , then grimaced as she saw the ugly scrape ##s on the palms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i should introduce myself , ' ' she started off , hiding her hands from his concerned view . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m victoria phillips . [SEP]
[CLS] how do you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] she extended the least abused hand , which , thankfully , was her right one . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r stared at the hand for a split second before accepting it . [SEP]
[CLS] the normal introduction would be for her to bow slightly before him but , continuing with the novelty of the situation , he took her hand in his , en ##folding her cold , slim , scraped hand in his large one , covering it with the other and taking a step towards her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is indeed a pleasure to make your acquaintance , ms . phillips . [SEP]
[CLS] i am dh ##ar ##r qu ##dam ##a , at your service . [SEP]
[CLS] i regret the incident which caused you to be in this position . [SEP]
[CLS] i will endeavor to make it up to you , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her eyes wide as she looked up into his dark , intense gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was my man who caused your fall . [SEP]
[CLS] he was acting with an over ##ze ##alo ##us sense of duty and will be eliminated immediately from my guard . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was horrified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean you ' re going to fire him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' he said , not an ounce of regret or emotion showing on his tanned face . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t like being responsible for anyone losing their job . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a tough economy and anyone fired would have a hard time finding a new position . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r reached up and gently touched a finger to the already darkening spot on her jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` such beauty should not be marred , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] phillips . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stu ##ttered , flu ##stered by this man ' s touch and confused as to why his touch could cause so much tu ##mu ##lt within her system when other men ' s touch just caused irritation . [SEP]
[CLS] she was also unsure of what this man represented but sure he was powerful and could genuinely hurt the man ' s chances of continued employment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but if he is on your staff , should n ' t you train him more thoroughly ? [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , really , if he acted inappropriate ##ly , is n ' t it your fault ? [SEP]
[CLS] should n ' t you give him a second chance ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r actually smiled this time . [SEP]
[CLS] it was too much . [SEP]
[CLS] he was constantly surrounded by people v ##ying for power and positions close to him , thereby making themselves more powerful in their associations with him . [SEP]
[CLS] but here was an innocent woman begging for a stranger ' s continued employment . [SEP]
[CLS] a stranger who could have broken her jaw if his swing had been any harder . [SEP]
[CLS] what she did n ' t know was that dh ##ar ##r ' s personal guard was the elite of the ash ##iri military , specially trained for years before they are even considered to be close to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] these men were trained in arms , munitions and personal combat but here was a woman weighing maybe a little more than one hundred pounds and might reach five and a half feet tall protecting a man she ' d never met . [SEP]
[CLS] the doctor returned to the closed off area with cleaning supplies and dh ##ar ##r took them , dismissing the man with a nod . [SEP]
[CLS] as he prepared a sterile ga ##uze to start the cleaning , he asked , ` ` you protect a man who wounded you . [SEP]
[CLS] yet you know nothing about him . [SEP]
[CLS] why would you do that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' victoria thought hard , knowing she had to come up with a reason why the man should n ' t be fired or feel awful about it , ` ` he did n ' t mean to , did he ? [SEP]
[CLS] it was only an accident . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the cool liquid felt wonderful against her suddenly aching knees . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t really noticed that they were still on fire while she was talking to the man called dh ##ar ##r but as she looked down , she noticed the mean looking scrape ##s on her knees . [SEP]
[CLS] raising the hem of her dress slightly , she saw that the scrape ##s were long and relatively deep . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , goodness , ' ' she said , in ##haling sharply when he put the ga ##uze on a particularly deep area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , instantly moving off the area , looking down at her face . [SEP]
[CLS] the compassion in his eyes created butterflies in her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt funny , knowing that this obviously powerful man was taking the time to clean her scrape ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she also felt bad for speaking to him so harshly a few moments before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry , ' ' she said , reaching out to take the ga ##uze so she could clean the area herself . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , this man ' s closeness was overwhelming her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can do that , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] she wished her hands did n ' t shake as she reached out to take the cleaning supplies from him . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r put a hand on her wrist to lower it , and continued his tender mini ##stra ##tions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` explain to me why you would defend someone you do n ' t know , ' ' he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled at his auto ##cratic tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are n ' t very good at asking , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` asking ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` asking what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria only laughed , her suspicions confirmed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that answers my question , does n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` explain , ' ' he said , enjoying the dim ##ples that suddenly appeared in her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] they brought his attention to her soft , full lips . [SEP]
[CLS] lips that would look lovely begging him to kiss her , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] his command to explain only caused another chuckle to burst from victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , you want to know why i would defend someone but instead of putting it to me as a query , you simply demand an answer . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you ' re mother would be ashamed of your manners , mr . [SEP]
[CLS] qu ##dam ##a . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r stared in shock as the tiny woman actually ts ##ske ##d him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help but smile in response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think my mother would be offended , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] her head tilted to the side and her sharp , green eyes turned curious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think all mothers would want their children to be raised with manners . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r liked the way her soft , brown hair fell over her shoulder as she tilted her head . [SEP]
[CLS] it was lovely , he thought and again he had the impulse to bury his hands in the long tres ##ses , pushing back the small , wi ##sp ##y curls that framed her face . [SEP]
[CLS] . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my mother is dead , ' ' he said without emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria instantly felt awful . [SEP]
[CLS] putting a hand out , she touched his shoulder , sure that the stiff ##ness in his manner was because of his recent loss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , mr . qu ##dam ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] i apologize for bringing it up . [SEP]
[CLS] it must have been hard for you , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] tears well ##ed in her eyes as she looked up into his hard , un ##yi ##eld ##ing ones . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can see that you miss her , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s hand stopped , not because he was finished but because he could no longer move . [SEP]
[CLS] the emotion cl ##og ##ging her voice and the tears in her eyes melted a small part of his heart that had been frozen for so long he had n ' t even known it existed . [SEP]
[CLS] why was this woman , this beautiful stranger , crying for his mother that had passed away when he was in his teens ? [SEP]
[CLS] he was thirty years old and long past needing his mother ' s comforting arms , which she ' d never offered to begin with . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' was all he could say . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria took the ga ##uze from his hand and finished the task , win ##cing several times when she hit a particularly painful spot but per ##se ##ver ##ing despite the pain . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was done , she looked up at him , smiling brightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that was n ' t so bad , i suppose , ' ' she replied and slid down off the gurney . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` promise me something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , picking up the mess and tossing it into the appropriate bin ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything , ' ' dh ##ar ##r promised . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , turning back to him with another bright smile on her face and mischief twin ##kling in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i ask for a new car or a castle ? [SEP]
[CLS] should n ' t you hear what i ' m asking before you promise the moon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r felt like chuck ##ling since he could indeed deliver on anything she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] possibly not the moon , but even that might be within the realm of possibility in a few years . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , anything within reason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria nodded but then turned serious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t do anything about the man who accidentally knocked me down , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it really wo n ' t be too bad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r walked closer to her and touched her skin where a bruise was already forming . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how old are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had to concentrate since his touch had driven all thoughts out of her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh . . . twenty , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only twenty ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , thinking he felt much older than his thirty years of age . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria blinked at his response , wondering if he thought her a child . [SEP]
[CLS] he was obviously much older than she was but felt it was important to point out that she was n ' t too young . [SEP]
[CLS] too young for what , she did n ' t let her mind define . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t feel ' only ' anything . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , twenty is n ' t too young , ' ' she asserted strongly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is n ' t too young for what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , and was delighted when she blushed again . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced away but only for a moment , looking back up at him through her long lashes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re teasing me , but really , i ' m not that young . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m only two years away from graduation which at times feels like eternity but will come eventually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he decided it would n ' t be gentleman ##ly to tease her more about her innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you studying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , changing the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` psychology . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what do you want to do with a degree in psychology ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` help people , ' ' she said without hesitation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` help who ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` children probably , ' she said , smiling despite her nervous ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are wonderful little people but sometimes they are so vulnerable and misunderstood . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r stared at her lips , the need to bend down and taste them almost overwhelming . [SEP]
[CLS] but he resisted the urge and took a step back . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed to just forget about this woman and her refreshing honesty and spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] he had work to do and very little time to finish it before heading back to ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now that you are cleaned up , may i give you a lift somewhere ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria snapped out of her dream were she was being kissed by the man . [SEP]
[CLS] he was probably married or seeing someone seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] no man this gorgeous and sexy could remain una ##tta ##ched . [SEP]
[CLS] she sat up straight ##er , testing her head tentatively by turning it from right to left . [SEP]
[CLS] when nothing happened , she shook her head in response to his offer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m only a block away from my class , ' ' she said and gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no ! [SEP]
[CLS] my class . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to be late , ' ' she said and hurried out of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] at the split in the curtains , she suddenly stopped and turned back to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you so much for your kindness , mr . qu ##dam ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry to have been so silly by faint ##ing on you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r watched her rush over to a nurse , taking out her wallet . [SEP]
[CLS] the nurse quickly shook her head , obviously explaining that the hospital bill had already been paid . [SEP]
[CLS] he slipped out of the curtain ##ed area , following the signs to the exit where he knew his limousine was waiting . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a refreshing interlude , but now it was over and he needed to get back to work . [SEP]
[CLS] once the nurse explained that one of the bu ##rly men with dh ##ar ##r had paid her bill already , victoria glanced back to the curtain ##ed area , intending to wave her thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] but the man was already gone . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart dropped and she felt like the sun had just left for the day , leaving only the heat and oppressive humidity . [SEP]
[CLS] walking out of the hospital , she looked up at the sunshine still beating down on the busy city sidewalks and sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] so much for life ' s little fantasies , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping out onto the sidewalk , she made a determined stride towards her class . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a once a week class so it would last three hours today . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d already missed the first hour but she could make it for the last two . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 2 victoria buried her head in her hands when her suite ##mate arrived , full of viva ##cious energy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine said , excitedly dancing into the shared sitting area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what a beautiful day ! [SEP]
[CLS] what are you doing studying ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , dumping her books onto a chair and taking a seat next to victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] being in their third year , they were in the suites instead of the dorm rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] that meant there were two bedrooms on either side of a small sitting area and a tiny kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much victoria tried to keep the areas cleaned up , jasmine was n ' t the most helpful . [SEP]
[CLS] but victoria loved the other woman ' s spirit and vital ##ity so she dealt with the negative side of jasmine while enjoying the fun side . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , victoria did n ' t have time to deal with either side right at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to hide her frustration at jasmine ' s inability to understand victoria ' s need for quiet . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria glanced up , smiling briefly at jasmine before looking back down at her book . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have my mid term exams tomorrow in three classes . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine flopped dramatically into the kitchen , searching for and finding a soda and popping the can before bouncing back to the sofa . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodness no ! [SEP]
[CLS] i had my mid terms earlier this week so i ' m pretty much free . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' ll bet you need a little time alone , ' ' jasmine grinned . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was instantly relieved that jasmine understood victoria ' s pre ##dic ##ament . [SEP]
[CLS] usually jasmine was a bit self - centered and would just ignore subtle as well as obvious hints for study time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would be lovely , ' ' victoria replied grateful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just call me if you need me to test you but you probably do n ' t need any more help . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing you , you ' ll ace the exams with out any studying , ' ' she said , bouncing off the sofa and heading for her room . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment after the door to jasmine ' s bedroom closed , the music started thumping loudly and victoria groaned in ex ##as ##peration . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing how jasmine would sit in her room for hours reading or just listening to her music , victoria grasped that relief was no where in sight . [SEP]
[CLS] resigned ##ly , she packed up her books and accepted that she ' d have to head to the library if she was to get any more studying done . [SEP]
[CLS] rushing out the door , victoria was tugging her bag over her shoulder and pulling the door to their suite closed at the same time when she ran into a solid brick wall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` o ##omp ##h ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] strong arms reached out to stop her backwards fall while at the same time , she dropped her bag and reached out to grab hold of the brick wall . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was steady again and able to focus , she looked up . [SEP]
[CLS] then up higher again . [SEP]
[CLS] right into the eyes of dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped , her eyes widening and her cheeks blushing instantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my , indeed . [SEP]
[CLS] we really have to stop meeting like this , ' ' he said but his hands remained on her hips , holding her close . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria quickly released her hold and stepped back , her blush deep ##ening when she realized she was holding onto him , and liking it . [SEP]
[CLS] the muscles she ' d felt under her hands were impressive and her fingers it ##ched to feel them again , to be close and smell his after ##sha ##ve which was spicy and masculine and just plain sexy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she said quickly , trying to hide her embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said , his eyes full of humor and appreciation for her beauty and refreshing innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just wish i could find a way to get closer without the possibility of mar ##ring such perfection , ' ' he said , one hand reaching out to touch the now purple area along her jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled but could n ' t hold his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , do n ' t worry about this , ' ' she said , waving the bruise aside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i bruise easily , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does it hurt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , ignoring her attempt to ease his conscience . [SEP]
[CLS] she dared to glance at him , wondering if the tenderness she heard in his voice was reflected in his face . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t but there was a softness in his eyes that had n ' t been there before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not really , ' ' she lied . [SEP]
[CLS] it actually ached quite a bit . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r smiled slightly and touched her cheek again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wonder if you ' re lying to protect me or the man who did this to you with his careless ##ness ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria laughed nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] besides her mother , no one had been able to see through her quite so easily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a little of both perhaps . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a tender heart , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] then he looked around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what is that noise ? [SEP]
[CLS] is someone beating themselves ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria listened for a moment and realized what he was hearing . [SEP]
[CLS] odd , but she ' d blocked out the rest of the world completely while he was touching her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that . . . ah . . . is my roommate , ' ' she explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s listening to music . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s mouth thin ##ned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not music , ' ' he declared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is simply noise . [SEP]
[CLS] and you are running from it yourself , are you not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she admitted . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r studied her for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you are too nice to ask her to turn it off ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] she suspected that he would never hesitate to ask someone to turn down their music but it just was n ' t in her to ask someone to change when it was just as easy for her to leave the area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s her suite as well , ' ' victoria justified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and where will you go to escape the ab ##hor ##rent noise ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was going over to the library to study , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] she suddenly looked up at him and asked , ` ` how did you find out where i lived ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she had n ' t given him her address , nor even where she was going to school . [SEP]
[CLS] it was odd that he had been able to track her down . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her for a long moment , considering his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have many sources , ' ' was all he would say in response . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched his eyes , wishing she had the courage to ask more , but he was too intimidating . [SEP]
[CLS] and overwhelming . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i need to go , ' ' she finally said . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t move , still staring up into his magnificent , dark eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have dinner with me tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria instantly smiled , delighted at the possibility of spending more time with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s face actually smiled again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really . [SEP]
[CLS] i would enjoy your company , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] her smile faded a moment later . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this just another way to try and pay me off ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because it is n ' t necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise , i wo n ' t sue you or your employee . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r actually laughed out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the thought never even entered my mind , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] it was delightful to talk to someone who did n ' t have any idea of who he was . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of someone sui ##ng the king of ash ##ir was too lu ##dic ##rous to con ##tem ##plate . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was going to re ##lish being just a man for as long as it lasted . [SEP]
[CLS] it was refreshing to see a woman ' s reaction to him and him alone . [SEP]
[CLS] not his title nor his power or wealth . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also refreshing to see such innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] the women of his acquaintance were either bred specifically to en ##tic ##e him and therefore were taught in the ways of pleasing a man and his tastes therefore became theirs . [SEP]
[CLS] or they were already well verse ##d in the ways of sex and only using him to find pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r avoided the first and encouraged the latter , enjoying the many women who threw themselves at him , seduce ##d as much by himself as by the idea of having a liaison , no matter how short or long , with the king of ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] the title alone would guarantee him unlimited numbers of women . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was spoiled by their attention ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but now , he was rev ##elin ##g in the an ##ony ##mity of being with this one , young innocent woman who knew nothing about him other than that he was surrounded by body guards at times . [SEP]
[CLS] he almost dread ##ed the moment when she would find out who he was . [SEP]
[CLS] it would change everything . [SEP]
[CLS] until that moment , he determined that he would enjoy her company . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guarantee that the thought had n ' t entered my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll pick you up at eight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could only nod in response . [SEP]
[CLS] she was having dinner with dh ##ar ##r ! [SEP]
[CLS] just like in her dream last night and she suspected that it would be even better than her dream . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` until tonight then , ' ' he said and bowed slightly before turning to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria leaned her back against the dormitory wall , afraid her knees would give out on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched him walk away , his stride confident and commanding . [SEP]
[CLS] the other students actually moved out of the way as he approached , apparently seeing the same thing she did when he walked . [SEP]
[CLS] that man definitely knew how to take charge , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] he disappeared around the stairway corner and she was finally able to snap out of her dream - like trance . [SEP]
[CLS] she also noticed the bulky men step out from the shadows and follow him . [SEP]
[CLS] goodness , she thought , she had n ' t even been aware that they were standing there only a few feet away . [SEP]
[CLS] they really knew how to make themselves invisible . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a little terrifying to know that , whatever dh ##ar ##r did for a living , he needed that kind of protection wherever he went . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing standing there , tory - girl ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott mason asked . [SEP]
[CLS] scott was tall but not nearly as all as dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also gang ##ly where dh ##ar ##r was muscular and scott ' s shoulders dr ##ooped as was the current fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was conservative elegance . [SEP]
[CLS] scott was the ep ##ito ##me of the latest fa ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] scott was also very homosexual and proud of it . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was her best friend . [SEP]
[CLS] he was brilliant and going to be one of the best fashion designers the world has ever seen since chan ##el and yves saint laurent . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a genius at women ' s fashion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps because he was a male who was n ' t interested in the female body as a sexual compliment , he was able to study the female body as an art form . [SEP]
[CLS] his designs were intriguing and creative , hiding any woman ' s flaws and emphasizing her assets . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had acted as a model for him on several occasions and therefore had several gorgeous outfits that he ' d created just for her . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria blinked at his sudden presence , then smiled brightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , scott ! [SEP]
[CLS] i met the most amazing man yesterday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ? [SEP]
[CLS] the last virgin on earth ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` impossible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` possible ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed , ignoring his ji ##be about her sexual status . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and he ' s incredibly gorgeous ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm ##m . . . any chance he might like me more than you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested , nu ##d ##ging her with his shoulder in a teasing fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` back off , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] bending down , she picked up her book bag and headed down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s taking me out to dinner tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott followed her along , thrilled that she ' d found someone she was interested in at last . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what are you going to wear ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , excited about the prospect of showing off one if his latest designs . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stopped in the middle of the stairway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no ! [SEP]
[CLS] scott , what am i going to wear ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , suddenly nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t go out with someone like dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s so out of my league , ' ' she said , her hand going up to cover her forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s champagne and i ' m . . . . . ' ' she struggled to find the appropriate words , ` ` tap water , ' ' she finally said . [SEP]
[CLS] scott laughed out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re kidding , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , looking down at her delicate beauty blocking the staircase . [SEP]
[CLS] other students were slipping around them so scott pulled her over to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] he saw that many of the men watched her for as long as possible , their eyes stray ##ing to her legs or any part of her sexy , petite frame . [SEP]
[CLS] and she had absolutely no idea that they were doing it . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the most un - vain woman he ' d ever met . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria bowed her head in frustration and anxiety . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not . [SEP]
[CLS] you should see him , scott ! [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s fabulous ! [SEP]
[CLS] and gorgeous and i suspect he ' s relatively rich so what in the world could i possibly offer a man like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott shook his head , amazed that this gorgeous woman did n ' t understand her worth . [SEP]
[CLS] she was sweet and sensitive with a deep understanding of other people ' s happiness and sadness . [SEP]
[CLS] the happiness she encouraged and the sadness , she was able tease them out of . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the most beautiful woman inside he ' d ever had the pleasure of knowing . [SEP]
[CLS] and outside , she was an absolute knockout whose figure he used to display his designs to perfection . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you worry about what to wear when i ' m around , ' ' he ad ##mon ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and as for the other , you just be yourself and he ' ll fall in love with you harder than you could ever imagine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , remembering saying that to dh ##ar ##r only a few minutes ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` really . [SEP]
[CLS] now if that bulging book bag is any indication , then you probably have mid ##ter ##ms tomorrow , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] after she nodded , scott suggested , ` ` then come along darling and while you ' re studying , i ' ll dream up other lovely creations to cover those magnificent breasts with , ' ' he said , laughing when he received the expected blush . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re bad , scott , ' ' she ad ##mon ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' ll take you up on your offer as long as rudy is n ' t here . [SEP]
[CLS] is he still visiting his parents in ireland ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , referring to scott ' s boyfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] he was nice enough but liked to talk when victoria needed quiet time to study and worry about tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he is so do n ' t worry . [SEP]
[CLS] plenty of quiet at my place , ' ' he assured her . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria spent the rest of the afternoon studying , forcing thoughts of dh ##ar ##r out of her mind until six o ' clock when scott demanded that she stop and get ready . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to do your hair , dear ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] because if i know you , and i do , ' ' he teased , ` ` then you ' re just going to brush it and leave it down , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was the plan , yes , ' ' she said , closing her book and tucking it into her book bag . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not going to work , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not if you ' re going to wear this , ' ' he said and pulled a creamy white , bea ##ded dress out of the closet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria gasped in delight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scott ! [SEP]
[CLS] it is wonderful , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] getting up , she walked over to the dress and touched the glittering se ##quin ##s that danced all over the fabric in a creative design . [SEP]
[CLS] there were flat se ##quin ##s as well as drop beads that created an almost flight ##y feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] the white would look perfect with her soft , brown hair and creamy skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when did you make this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no time for flat ##tery . [SEP]
[CLS] just hop into the shower and then come out here . [SEP]
[CLS] and just please tell me you are n ' t wearing your usual plain , white underwear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria blushed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you have anything else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] besides , dh ##ar ##r is n ' t going to see my underwear tonight anyway , ' ' she claimed and slipped into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pity , ' ' scott said , noting her perfect der ##rier ##e , which was the last thing he saw before the bathroom door closed . [SEP]
[CLS] while she ' d been in the shower , scott had called over to jasmine to explain the situation and ask that she bring over some makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] an hour and a half later , scott put the final touches on her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d demanded that she blow dry her hair , then he curled the ends so her hair floated around her shoulders like a soft , brown cloud . [SEP]
[CLS] the dress was the perfect foil for her figure , enhancing her tiny waist and pushing her breasts higher . [SEP]
[CLS] her cleavage was showing over the neck ##line , making her breasts look larger than they really were . [SEP]
[CLS] and since she was n ' t small breast ##ed in the first place , they became quite obvious in the dress . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 3 victoria stared at her reflection in the mirror and was astonished . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d modeled many dresses for scott before , some more daring than this one . [SEP]
[CLS] but she ' d only been in front of a camera when she ' d worn them . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never before been about to embark on a date with a man so much more world ##ly than she was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scott , are you sure about this dress ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , pulling up the top and trying to flat ##ten out her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is n ' t it too . . . . revealing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she finished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' he said , smiling in the mirror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it looks great , ' ' jasmine exclaimed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i still think you should wear more makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] just a touch of liner to your eyes would make them look bigger , sm ##oki ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] very sexy , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not really me , jasmine , ' ' she said , smiling to soft ##en the rejection . [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine sighed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d just like to meet this guy . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve never been excited about the men i ' ve set you up with . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s so great about this one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , smiling and settling down with a glass of wine that scott handed her . [SEP]
[CLS] scott rolled his eyes and poured a glass for himself , not bothering to offer one to victoria although he thought she needed one just to calm herself down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should know that victoria would n ' t be interested in the men you bring around , jasmine . [SEP]
[CLS] just look at them and then look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] all the men you introduce her to have body piercing ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] does victoria really look like someone who would be interested in someone like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine looked at her sweet , innocent looking suite ##mate and sighed , knowing that scott had a point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eh , you ' ve got to try them all on , you know , before you settle down with one of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott took a sip of wine before responding to jasmine ' s latest philosophy for her life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s another thing , victoria does n ' t try them on . [SEP]
[CLS] she barely even tastes them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria laughed , knowing how the discussion was heading since it had all been said before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop . [SEP]
[CLS] you both make me sound like a fr ##ig ##id old maid . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not quite on the shelf yet , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott eyed victoria in the dress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we can only hope that this dh ##ar ##r person takes you down from the shelf , dear ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m telling you , you ' re missing out on a lot of fun . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shivered in excitement at the idea of dh ##ar ##r ' taking her off the shelf ' , so to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m glad you both wo n ' t be accompanying me tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] i shudder at the idea of what you would suggest during dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as long as you ' re shuddering , dear , that ' s all we care about , ' ' scott said . [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine cl ##ink ##ed glasses with him , chuck ##ling at their turn of phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria just rolled her eyes and picked up her books . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m heading out . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you later , ' ' she called out as she left the dorm . [SEP]
[CLS] she had only five more minutes before dh ##ar ##r was supposed to be picking her up at her dorm . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d have to hurry to get back there in time . [SEP]
[CLS] she reached her dorm just as dh ##ar ##r was walking up the steps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , slightly breathless from rushing across campus in high heel ##ed shoes and the two flights of stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me just drop my bag inside and grab my purse , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look lovely , ' ' he said and watched her rush across the room , enjoying again her refreshing innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned his instincts yet again . [SEP]
[CLS] his mind was telling him that she was pure but he could n ' t understand how someone with so lush a figure could not know a man ' s body . [SEP]
[CLS] it was inc ##on ##ce ##iva ##ble to him . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was going to enjoy the illusion for a while . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said and turned to face him , looking down as she picked up a small bea ##ded purse . [SEP]
[CLS] the purse did n ' t really match the dress but it was the only evening bag she owned . [SEP]
[CLS] it would just have to do , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m ready , ' ' she claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope so , ' ' he said and offered his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria placed her hand on his arm and smiled shy ##ly , his words echoing in her mind as she tried to translate them . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she just enjoyed the delicious feeling of touching his arm , wondering what it would be like to kiss him , have him kiss her back . [SEP]
[CLS] dinner that night was incredible for victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] she was from a small village and , prior to dinner with dh ##ar ##r , attending university in london had been the most amazing thing to have happen to her . [SEP]
[CLS] but being in the expensive restaurant , surrounded by the move ##rs and shake ##rs of london society , victoria tried to hide her awe for fear of looking like a silly , country girl in front of dh ##ar ##r who seemed completely at home in the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the menu was in french and , although she could speak it conversation ##ally , with dh ##ar ##r sitting across from her , the menu might as well be in sw ##ah ##ili . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like me to order for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested , noting her nervous ##ness and assuming it was because she could n ' t read the words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that would be lovely , ' ' she said , laying her menu to the side and sighing with relief . [SEP]
[CLS] now she could hide her shaking hands under the table . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ordered in perfect , fluent french , ordering a bottle of champagne that , if victoria had been more world ##ly , she ' d know cost over a thousand dollars a bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew he ordered her a salad and himself a beef dish and she tried not to cr ##inge . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated salad but thought it was what he expected her to prefer . [SEP]
[CLS] and since she had n ' t had the te ##mer ##ity to order for herself , she deserved what she got . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about yourself , ' ' he commanded when the waiter was gone . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria took a bread ##stick and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what would you like to know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is n ' t that a lot for a first date ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely . [SEP]
[CLS] so start talking , ' ' he commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] but she saw the humor in his eyes so she did n ' t take offense . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , as i mentioned yesterday , i ' m twenty years old and am attending the university of london on scholarship . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m studying psychology but considering making my focus children ' s psychology . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because they seem like the most misunderstood part of the population . [SEP]
[CLS] they ca n ' t always express themselves so they act out in sometimes violent ways . [SEP]
[CLS] most people do n ' t even try to interpret their actions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what if the child is just innate ##ly bad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head in disagreement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there is no such thing , ' ' she said adamant ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any child that is lash ##ing out is just in pain and we ' ve caused it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you including everyone or just the child ' s parents ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her grin was imp ##ish as she looked across the table at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m not that nice . [SEP]
[CLS] i think we as a society are all responsible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about the parents that are bad behind closed doors and we do n ' t know about it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` usually people know . [SEP]
[CLS] children give off signals and if we choose to ignore them , well then we re ##ap what we so ##w ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what about the men in your life ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked changing the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria understood that he disagreed with her on her child psychology but that was okay . [SEP]
[CLS] not everyone needed to agree with everyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] diversity was what made the world work in wonderful ways , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t currently have a boyfriend but my suite ##mate , jasmine , is constantly setting me up with men she thinks would suit me wonderful ##ly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what kind of man does she think is suitable for someone like you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s head tilted slightly to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what kind of a woman do you think i am ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r leaned closer and took her hand , drawing circles on the palm while his eyes held hers hostage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re younger than your twenty years in some ways , older in others . [SEP]
[CLS] and i think you ' re ideal ##istic which is sad because you ' re going to be disappointed when you enter the real world after college . [SEP]
[CLS] but you ' re strong and will survive . [SEP]
[CLS] and i think you ' re going to be in my bed soon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could barely breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] his thumb was tracing patterns on her palm and moved slowly up to her wrist , sending shivers through her entire system . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to pull her hand from his but he would n ' t release it . [SEP]
[CLS] and he continued to stare at her eyes , seeing the fear that entered them with his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to be afraid of me , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise you that anything you do with me , you wo n ' t regret . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can you promise something like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i ' ll make it so , ' ' he said , arrogance re ##eki ##ng from his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t with you doing that to my hand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you feel it too ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` feel what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r allowed a half smile , wondering if she was serious or just pretending . [SEP]
[CLS] because he was so cynical , he half considered calling her on the issue . [SEP]
[CLS] but the other half of him wanted to play along , let her either play the game or let him determine that she was the real thing . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled his hand away and sat back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never mind , ' ' he replied , noting the confusion in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] she was either the real thing or she was the best actress he ' d ever met . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about your classes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they talked throughout the dinner and eventually victoria was able to relax . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r made her laugh more than she had in years and she ' d never talked so much in her life . [SEP]
[CLS] but each time she questioned him , he simply reverted back to asking her questions . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the night when he was walking her to her door , she knew no more about him than she did when she left the hospital the day before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to kiss you , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said , turning her to face him in the dimly lit hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] it was around midnight so the students who were party ##ing were still out for another few hours and the ones who had settled in earlier were already asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] they were relatively alone in the hallway and the realization sped up victoria ' s heart rate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would be nice , ' ' she whispered but she was shaking all over . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even know what to do with her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been kissed in the past , but it had been selfish kisses where the men simply put their mouths on hers without any permission or signal from her . [SEP]
[CLS] each time , she ' d waited for some feeling to stir within her but had been left cold and had pulled away before anything serious started . [SEP]
[CLS] now , standing here with dh ##ar ##r looking down at her , she felt young and foolish , unsure of what to do to encourage him or how to even start the kiss she wanted so badly . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , he took matters into his own hands . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hands in his and pulled her closer , settling his own large , strong hands on her waist , leaving hers to flutter around his chest before finally settling down on his lap ##els . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up under her lashes , wondering why he was taking so long but the desire she saw in his eyes almost scared her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was about to pull back when his hands pulled her forward . [SEP]
[CLS] their bodies touched and she gasped at the intensity of feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] there was heat sur ##ging through her stomach , pool ##ing at the core of her being and melting her insides . [SEP]
[CLS] her surprised eyes glanced up at his but all thought disappeared when his lips touched hers . [SEP]
[CLS] they were gentle at first , then more pressure , touching , caressing , instant ache settling inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` open your mouth , victoria , ' ' dh ##ar ##r groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand lifted from her waist to touch her chin , his thumb pulling her chin down so her mouth opened . [SEP]
[CLS] instantly , his tongue entered her mouth , mating with hers , absorbing her gasp with his mouth as he increased the pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue moved in and out , im ##itating the mating that his body was craving to do with hers right at this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] his mind told him to slow down , not to scare her but to gently teach her how to kiss since she was obviously un ##sch ##ool ##ed in the art . [SEP]
[CLS] but his body was painfully hard , aching to push into her soft flesh and find the release he knew instinctively would be better than anything he ' d ever experienced . [SEP]
[CLS] with incredible determination , dh ##ar ##r found the resources within him to pull back , to slow down and give her room to breathe . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t what he wanted , but he knew that the next step would terri ##fy her . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t want her scared . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her to learn step by step how to please him and for her to teach him how to please her . [SEP]
[CLS] it would n ' t be accomplished in one night . [SEP]
[CLS] so he pulled back and lifted his head , noting with satisfaction that her eyes were still closed and her hands were gripping his lap ##els . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria took a long , shuddering breath and opened her eyes to find dh ##ar ##r staring down into her own . [SEP]
[CLS] the desire she ' d seen before was still there but there was something more , something stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind would n ' t comprehend anything at the moment but she accepted that the mind - shattering kiss was over . [SEP]
[CLS] closing her mouth , she hid her disappointment and slowly released her hold on his suit , feeling embarrassed that she had n ' t even realized she ' d been doing that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have dinner with me again tomorrow night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria thought frantically . [SEP]
[CLS] she had mid term exams tomorrow but she ' d be finished by the late afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , but it is my turn to treat you , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] he was astonished that she would even suggest something like treating him to dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] although no one had done that in the past , not even suggested such a thing , it warmed his heart that she should be the first . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no need , ' ' dh ##ar ##r replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i insist . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise , nothing fancy but you ' ll like it . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope , ' ' she said , biting her lip in ind ##ec ##ision . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved to cook and experiment with foods but could she compete with the go ##ur ##met meals he was obviously used to ? [SEP]
[CLS] it worried her for only a moment but then her sense of fairness came back . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d bought her dinner tonight , it was her turn and she would just do her best . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r looked at her , noting her excitement and enthusiasm , considering his options . [SEP]
[CLS] he could insist that he buy her dinner again since it was obvious she could n ' t afford to buy him dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] or he could find out what she had in mind and possibly learn more about her at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] since he wanted to know everything about this tiny , beautiful and , he suspected , sensitive woman , he gave in to her request this time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as you wish . [SEP]
[CLS] what time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` about seven ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled imp ##ishly , ` ` i ' d offer to pick you up but i do n ' t have a car and i do n ' t think you ' d like riding the tube with me . [SEP]
[CLS] so you ' ll just have to meet me somewhere . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r laughed , appalled at the idea of riding on public transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] not only would he never dei ##gn to do it , the security issues it would involve if he ever did would ho ##rri ##fy his body guards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll pick you up here at seven thirty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled tentatively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , but would you mind if i met you in the parking lot ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t like the ghost of apprehension which entered her beautiful green eyes as she asked this question . [SEP]
[CLS] and it went against his sense of prop ##riety for her to not be picked up and escorted properly . [SEP]
[CLS] because of where he was hoping their relationship was going , he felt the need to treat her with every dignity and respect she deserved as his future wife . [SEP]
[CLS] for other women he ' d been with in the past , he never would have extended the courtesy of picking them up at their door . [SEP]
[CLS] and the fact that victoria was sc ##orn ##ing this small indication of his respect for her annoyed him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she saw the annoyance on his face and worried about it , but stood firm in her desire to hide their relationship until she understood it better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i ' m afraid my friends might start asking me questions and right now , i do n ' t have any answers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her response made him feel somewhat better but he still wanted more explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what kinds of questions ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shrugged her shoulders slightly , smiling up at him as she said , ` ` oh , simple things , like your last name , what you do for a living , where you live . [SEP]
[CLS] you know , minor details . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you my last name yesterday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked down at her hands which were clasped in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , but i could n ' t remember it . [SEP]
[CLS] so when my suite ##mate asked me today , i could n ' t answer and it was embarrassing . [SEP]
[CLS] and over dinner , i noticed that you did n ' t answer any questions . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , the men you have waiting downstairs for you are a little scary . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know if all those bulge ##s are muscles and i do n ' t want to know , ' ' she said when he was about to answer her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are some things that are better left to the imagination . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded although he was amused at her fear of his body guards and their weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r faced reality head on , knowing that the world was not a nice place and anticipating issues . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria obviously preferred to see the world as much nice ##r than it really was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fair enough . [SEP]
[CLS] and tomorrow , you can ask me anything you ' d like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and will you answer me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if it is the right question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she had to laugh back , amazed yet again at his arrogance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fair enough . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodnight , victoria , ' ' he said and touched her bruised cheek gently . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her key and unlocked the door for her before handing it back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sweet dreams . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria watched him walk away for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one more thing , dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she called out . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned at the top of the stair well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria bit her lip , wondering if she could actually ask the question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you mind if you . . . well , did n ' t wear a suit tomorrow ? [SEP]
[CLS] it might get a little dirty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r grinned but nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if that is your wish , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 4 victoria nervously slid her hands down the sides of her k ##hak ##i slacks and white tee - shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] the picnic basket was by her feet and she had a blanket on top of it . [SEP]
[CLS] would dh ##ar ##r think this was a silly idea ? [SEP]
[CLS] she hoped not . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have a lot of money and a simple meal was the most elaborate thing she could think of . [SEP]
[CLS] she even knew of a wonderful place by the thames in a park only a few miles away . [SEP]
[CLS] they could just sit on the grass away from everyone else and simply enjoy the night descending . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , it was a little cooler tonight with the promise of fall scent ##ing the air . [SEP]
[CLS] the leaves had n ' t started changing yet but they would in another few weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] she saw the limousine turn into the parking lot and her heart instantly sped up in anticipation of seeing dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] absently , she wondered how long this feeling of excitement would last . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d felt it for a few other dates , until the end of the dates , that is when they tried kissing her by mas ##hing their mouths against hers . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s when the feeling had ended . [SEP]
[CLS] so had the relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] the long , black car pulled up right next to her and victoria smiled and opened the back door just as a man was getting out of the front seat , possibly to open the car for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she simply waved to the man and picked up the basket and blanket , then disappeared into the back seat . [SEP]
[CLS] sitting down next to dh ##ar ##r , she noted the frown on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good evening ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you should wait for the door to be opened for you , victoria , ' ' he ad ##mon ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at the now closed door and blinked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , turning back to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you are a lady . [SEP]
[CLS] a gentleman opens the door for her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria knew he was serious but she could n ' t help laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s silly when i ' m perfectly capable of opening the door for myself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` regardless , you will permit my guards to open the doors for you in the future , ' ' he ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] her smile disappeared and she nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , if that ' s what you want , ' ' she said quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r instantly light ##ened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] but this is what i want , ' ' he said and pulled her forward . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had thought he wanted just a small kiss , like her father would give to her mother occasionally . [SEP]
[CLS] but dh ##ar ##r pulled her onto his lap and lowered his head to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth touched hers and within a moment , his hand was pulling her chin down , just as he had the previous night and his tongue dipped into her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s mind went blank and her whole body was reacting to instinct ##ive feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] her body arched against his . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard a moan but did n ' t realize it was her as his mouth took over hers , his tongue exploring her mouth and making her dizzy with unexpected and unfamiliar feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r pulled back slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` put your tongue in my mouth , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do as i do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth came back to hers and she needed no prompting this time to open to him . [SEP]
[CLS] and when his tongue touched hers , she tentatively moved her tongue back , im ##itating his movements and the feelings that had been building only intensified as she learned to participate in the kiss and not just accept it . [SEP]
[CLS] absently , she felt his hands on her back but they did n ' t move even though her body was cl ##amo ##ring for him to touch hers . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved her hands from his shoulders , nervously touching his neck , desperate to touch his skin in some way . [SEP]
[CLS] when her fingertips touched his skin , she felt the heat of his body and they ski ##ttered away after just the simple touch , afraid he might get angry if she went any further . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard his chuckle deep in his throat and pulled back , her eyes questioning and worried that he ' d felt her touch and was laughing at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she said , wanting to move off his lap in embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] but he stopped her movement and rested his hands on the sides of her hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , please touch me anywhere you ' d like , ' ' he said and pulled her right hand so it was touching his neck , her fingers tick ##ling his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] she immediately pulled her hand away but he just laughed again and put it right back against his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t touch me , victoria , i ' m going to die , ' ' he said and pulled her back against his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and believe me , i ' m going to touch you , ' ' he said a moment before his mouth bent to kiss her again . [SEP]
[CLS] but his hands did n ' t move anywhere other than her hips and waist while her hands felt free to explore his skin , his hair , touching him anywhere she could find his skin and rev ##ele ##d in the amazing feeling of him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was like rough velvet , if that was a possible description . [SEP]
[CLS] and his hair was soft and light to her touch . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved his hair , feeling so different from hers . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r enjoyed the painful feeling of wanting victoria , knowing he could do nothing about it . [SEP]
[CLS] if anything showed him that she really was a virgin , it was her tentative touching and in ##ex ##per ##ience with kissing . [SEP]
[CLS] finally he ended the kiss and pulled back , smiling down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are we going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sat up straight and looked out the windows , noting the buildings of london as they passed by . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are we going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my driver has just been driving around aim ##lessly , waiting for direction from me . [SEP]
[CLS] or more specifically , you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria slid off his lap , grateful that he did n ' t stop her this time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean he . . . . dh ##ar ##r please tell me he is n ' t suspect ##ing that we ' re back here kissing ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she exclaimed , her hands covering her mouth and her face turning the becoming shade of red he was coming to expect now . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t think she ' d appreciate the fact that his driver and the guards that were in the front seat , not to mention the ones that were following in the suv behind him , would assume that he was doing much more than kissing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are busy watching the road , i ' m sure , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] that made her feel better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , in that case , can you ask them to drive us over to the park by the thames ? [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a nice little spot where i can ask you all sorts of questions without being interrupted . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r picked up the phone and spoke in a foreign language , then just as quickly hung up again . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was done , he turned back to her expect ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how were your exams today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she was flat ##tered that he remembered her telling him about her exams . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , i think . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t know for another week . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happens in a week ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i get my grades , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah . [SEP]
[CLS] my mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure you did well on them , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i feel pretty good about them . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i ' ll do okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at him tentatively . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where did you go to university ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oxford , ' ' he replied without hesitation . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was impressed . [SEP]
[CLS] and since he ' d answered that one so quickly , she felt brave enough to ask more questions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you do for a living ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` various things , ' ' he said honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] well that was a non - answer if she ' d ever heard one . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled , hoping he would elaborate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` such as ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] he was still enjoying the an ##ony ##mity of her not knowing about his title or power . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered all the things he could tell her and settled on the least revealing without lying to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m currently in london negotiating oil contracts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah ! [SEP]
[CLS] that explains a lot . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what does it explain ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your . . . aura of power , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that sounds silly but you just have a sense about you . [SEP]
[CLS] like you ' re used to being in charge . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t respond but was impressed with her senses . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously she was more alert than he ' d given her credit for . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else do you want to know about me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s it like negotiating oil leases ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sometimes it can be difficult , depending on who is negotiating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who are you negotiating with right now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the british government . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , ' ' she said , suddenly a little intimidated by his power . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where did you grow up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , changing the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] he hesitated before answering , wondering if his answer would give him away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in ash ##ir . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow ! [SEP]
[CLS] what was that like ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve heard that some parts of the country are pretty dangerous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , the crime rate is lower in ash ##ir than in great britain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her head tilted to the side as she tried to remember her history lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is n ' t the government a monarchy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think that will change ? [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t the people want a more democratic state ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he choked on his laugh , her suggestion treason ##ous in his mind since he was the head of the government of ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled slightly , understanding his statement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m guessing from your response that you work for the government ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r laughed outright now and noted that they were pulling up at the park . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re here , ' ' he said , avoiding having to tell her that he was at the top of the government . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria picked up the picnic basket and blanket but they were instantly taken out of her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t carry this , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said and handed it to the waiting guard behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s heart sank . [SEP]
[CLS] she was hoping for a little privacy but now realized that the guards would probably be following them the entire time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do they have to come along ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered to him as she led the way down the path . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m afraid that they must always be with me , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are a necessary evil . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced at the five bu ##rly men surrounding them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t realize that negotiating oil leases was so dangerous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are many people who would prefer that i not be around , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re probably a pretty tough dictator , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can imagine you laying down the oil price and not moving a sm ##idge . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed , uncomfortable with the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to steer it away from himself but knew that he ' d promised to answer her questions . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he could n ' t answer them completely but would give her small glimpse ##s into his life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else do you want to know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] everything she thought to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to know how this man woke up in the morning , what he did all day long and how he ' d become the incredible man he was today . [SEP]
[CLS] she ignored the other ni ##gg ##ling questions like , was he dating other people besides her ? [SEP]
[CLS] or had he ever been in love before ? [SEP]
[CLS] those questions hurt her , deep inside somewhere she did n ' t want to explore . [SEP]
[CLS] she also did n ' t think she had the right to ask them . [SEP]
[CLS] this was only their third meeting and one did n ' t really count since it was an accident . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you learn to negotiate oil leases ? [SEP]
[CLS] what got you into the business ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked the most mundane first , wondering how much of himself he would reveal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it runs in the family , ' ' he answered . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the truth in a sense but not the way she ' d been asking the question . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d inherited his title from his father , and therefore all the responsibilities of running ash ##ir along with the title . [SEP]
[CLS] negotiating oil leases was just one of the activities that fell to him as the king . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t negotiate all of them , only the very large contracts with large countries since politics and treaties were usually involved as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the smaller countries or companies were delegate ##d to others within the government . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about that spot over there , ' ' she said , pointing to an area that was surrounded by trees but still had a grassy spot that looked out onto the thames . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked back to his guards who nodded imp ##er ##ce ##pt ##ibly . [SEP]
[CLS] turning back to victoria , he nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is fine , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria took the blanket from the guard , smiling her thanks at him and spread it out on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r had the picnic basket and took her hand to help her onto the blanket . [SEP]
[CLS] she laid out the ingredients to the picnic and looked up , surprised to find that they were completely alone . [SEP]
[CLS] or so it seemed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are your guards ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are near but out of sight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sat down next to her and looked at the food . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you make all this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , touched to see that there were homemade cookies and freshly cut fruit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you make these ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , picking up a cookie to sample . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was busy setting out the other items she ' d made for their dinner and glanced up to see him holding a lemon cookie curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] do you like lemon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked tentatively . [SEP]
[CLS] they were her favorite kind of cookie but she knew some people did n ' t really like lemon or the sweetness of these kinds of cookies . [SEP]
[CLS] they were lemon cookies with a very sweet lemon frost ##ing on them . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria knew she had a horrible sweet tooth and liked things extra sweet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do . [SEP]
[CLS] i just do n ' t think . . . . ' ' he stopped , glanced at her and smiled before popping the cookie into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes widened in surprise and delight as he tasted the rich , sweet cookie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is delicious , ' ' he said and picked up another one . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s face brightened and she felt a warm glow spread through her system . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad you like them , ' ' she said and pushed the bowl containing the rest closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced off to the side nervously then bus ##ily prepared the roasted chicken on a plate for him along with potato salad and freshly sliced peach ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] when he popped three more into his mouth , she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to ruin your appetite for dinner , ' ' she ad ##mon ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what else is there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , sneaking one more cookie before taking the plate she offered . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria moved so she could check behind him , then glanced down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i made garlic chicken and potato salad . [SEP]
[CLS] but i did n ' t put ce ##ler ##y in the salad . [SEP]
[CLS] i hate ce ##ler ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope you do n ' t mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` potato salad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , moving his plastic fork around on the plate to investigate the white mass of potato salad she ' d just put there . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stopped her search for his guards and blinked at him , her green eyes astonished as she watched him move the potato salad around , sniff it , then take a taste . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you never had potato salad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never had a homemade cookie , i suppose you could say . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a night of first ##s for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was too odd . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t your mother make cookies for holidays or company ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think my mother knew where the kitchen was , ' ' he said honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she would simply tell her assistant who would be attending any given function and her assistant would tell the chef . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria swallowed with difficulty . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you had a chef ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and your mother had a personal assistant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d known he was wealthy but that statement put him into a whole different realm . [SEP]
[CLS] and the idea of never making cookies with a parent made her feel sad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry you did n ' t make cookies , ' ' she said , putting her plate down onto her lap , her eyes expressing her sympathy for a childhood devoid of a wonderful bonding experience with a parent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you ever wish you could ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s black eyes looked up at hers and he almost laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] but the sincerity he saw there made him stop . [SEP]
[CLS] she really felt bad for him ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ran a finger gently down her un - bruised cheek and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know i was missing anything significant . [SEP]
[CLS] none of my friends ever had the experience either so do n ' t feel bad for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could see the humor in his eyes and felt silly suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously he had a completely different upbringing than she did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , how about the potato salad . [SEP]
[CLS] do you like it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r took a bite skeptical ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] but again , his eyes showed his surprise at the sa ##vor ##y bite of potato in a creamy , garlic sauce . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s delicious . [SEP]
[CLS] where did you get it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i made it silly . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t really buy good potato salad . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , most places put ce ##ler ##y in it and , as i said , i hate ce ##ler ##y . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took a bite and glanced behind her again . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r caught her nervous look and sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] placing the plate beside him , he took her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , i ca n ' t send them away . [SEP]
[CLS] but i promise you that they are well hidden and are looking outward ##s and definitely not looking at us . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sighed and her shoulders dr ##ooped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re obviously from different worlds . [SEP]
[CLS] you have guards and chefs and personal assistants . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a messy kitchen and a suite ##mate with loud tastes in awful music . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but you ' re looking at the things that are different but consider the things that draw us together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t really see many of those , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i see you ' re beautiful eyes , and a mouth i ' ve been wanting to kiss ever since we sat down . [SEP]
[CLS] i see you ' re lovely . . . ' ' he was about to say breasts but changed his mind , afraid she would n ' t appreciate his comment , ` ` hands that have made this delicious meal for me and i feel honored . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled , suddenly glad she had gone to so much trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] she had heard the hesitation in his voice and a part of her wondered what he had been about to say , but then his lips touched hers and all her thoughts flew away . [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned forward , wanting to kiss him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r wanted to pull her across the blanket and lay her down , covering her gorgeous body with his and feel her softness against his hard frame . [SEP]
[CLS] but he held back , knowing he would have to go slowly or fright ##en her away . [SEP]
[CLS] she was obviously un ##tu ##tore ##d in the art of love ##making and he ' d have to take it step by step . [SEP]
[CLS] she had been ski ##tti ##sh about kissing him yesterday . [SEP]
[CLS] what could he teach her today , he wondered . [SEP]
[CLS] the ideas flashed through his mind but he pulled back , app ##re ##cia ##ting the heightened color on her translucent skin . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes opened slowly , revealing the desire she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] it felt good to know that he had put it there , and better that she was too inexperienced to hide her feelings , or her reaction to his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] being decisive was one of the reasons his rule over ash ##ir had been so successful over the past five years . [SEP]
[CLS] he gathered information and made decisions usually without the consent of his advisors . [SEP]
[CLS] initially they were furious that he would push them aside except when making the more important decisions , but over the years , he had proven that his actions had been beneficial . [SEP]
[CLS] his advisors have backed down , with only a few concerns floating around occasionally . [SEP]
[CLS] now , looking at victoria ' s flushed face and her incredible green eyes that could hide nothing from him , he made the decision that he would marry her . [SEP]
[CLS] it would take a great deal of training , he knew , to teach her to be a proper queen . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d be marrying into an already established system with conservative values . [SEP]
[CLS] but the fact that she was a virgin , and he did n ' t doubt that anymore , would put her in a good position to learn what was right and wrong within ash ##iri customs . [SEP]
[CLS] she would eventually mo ##uld herself and become a good ash ##iri bride and queen . [SEP]
[CLS] he would teach some things , like how he wanted her in bed and he could hire tutor ##s to teach her the rest . [SEP]
[CLS] his mind was already making plans , considering the arguments of marrying a foreigner and coming up with arguments against them . [SEP]
[CLS] he would have her , he knew . [SEP]
[CLS] how long ? [SEP]
[CLS] he decided six months . [SEP]
[CLS] he would give her two months to get used to him and then he would propose to her . [SEP]
[CLS] that would give her four months to prepare and learn as much as possible before the wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s face instantly cleared . [SEP]
[CLS] the decision was made . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria would be his bride in six months . [SEP]
[CLS] he would have to reveal to her that he was king but he would hold off on that for a few more meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] he was still enjoying the an ##ony ##mity of being with her . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , he ' d hold off for a while longer . [SEP]
[CLS] she would eventually find out the truth and that would be soon enough . [SEP]
[CLS] so far , he had n ' t lied to her . [SEP]
[CLS] if she ever asked a question that he had to reveal the truth , he would so do at that time . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered putting guards on her but then rejected the idea at least for the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never done that before and doing so would reveal too much . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , any guard stationed near to her would be pretty obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] his elite forces were trained to protect . [SEP]
[CLS] not to blend in . [SEP]
[CLS] there were other agents that he could assign to the task . [SEP]
[CLS] they were meant to blend , but they were also trained to observe and analyze . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t want his actions to be known just yet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you thinking about so intently ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , surprised that she dared . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked ferocious , she thought to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] how could the man go from smiling to a hard , un ##re ##ve ##aling face in only moments ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you , ' ' he said without hesitation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and how hungry i am , ' ' he said honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was n ' t for food . [SEP]
[CLS] now that he had made the decision , his body was aching to touch her , and make her his own . [SEP]
[CLS] to teach her about sex and making love and all the ways to pleasure each other . [SEP]
[CLS] but he rev ##ele ##d in the pain those thoughts produced . [SEP]
[CLS] the waiting would only make the cu ##lm ##ination more intense , more powerful . [SEP]
[CLS] his mind controlled his body and he allowed the pain to enter into his mind , blocking out the urges so he could enjoy the game , the chase , and especially the discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of telling her the rest , he picked up his plate and tasted the chicken . [SEP]
[CLS] it was actually quite good . [SEP]
[CLS] the meat was tender and juicy with a subtle taste of garlic and some other herb he could n ' t identify . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m touched that you went to this much trouble just for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was nothing , ' ' she lied . [SEP]
[CLS] she had rushed home from her exams and dumped her books before heading out to the grocery store . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t a short walk either since most of the students were encouraged to eat in the dining halls . [SEP]
[CLS] several students cooked their meals but they generally had bikes to get to and from the market . [SEP]
[CLS] once she ' d picked up all the ingredients , she hurried back to her dorm and spent the afternoon cooking , cutting , baking and mixing the meal , desperate to impress him with her cooking . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved to cook and it usually relaxed her . [SEP]
[CLS] but she knew what kinds of foods dh ##ar ##r was used to and had gone to extra effort , and expense , just to show him that she could do something for him . [SEP]
[CLS] she definitely could n ' t afford to take him out to eat , unable to afford the prices at a normal restaurant , much less the kind he frequented . [SEP]
[CLS] but she could cook a decent meal . [SEP]
[CLS] the evening was supposed to be her opportunity to ask him questions and she was able to get a few in . [SEP]
[CLS] but the majority of the time , she answered his . [SEP]
[CLS] for every one question she was able to ask , he asked five . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] it was obvious to her that he was n ' t used to sharing his past with others so even the small ti ##db ##its of information he revealed were precious to her and she sa ##vor ##ed his laughter and stories in her heart . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria suspected that he did n ' t laugh much so she searched her memories of her childhood for stories she thought he might laugh at . [SEP]
[CLS] growing up in a small village with her parents and sister on a small farm , she ' d had plenty of humorous stories to tell him . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole time though , she was intensely conscious of his thigh so near to her own . [SEP]
[CLS] and each time she moved or he moved , it seemed that they were somehow closer together . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time she pulled the cookies out for dessert , the sun had set and the stars were popping out in the ink ##y night sky and she was searching for something more to say , to distract herself from his body which was only an inch away from hers . [SEP]
[CLS] why did this one man make her body come alive when no other man had had any effect on her ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been around many men before , dated whenever she felt like she was missing out on something but then finding that most men were fine as friends but annoying when they tried to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t she have at least learned something from those other men so she did n ' t feel so awkward now when all she wanted to do was reach up and kiss him , to touch her lips to his and feel those wonderful sensations that only he could create within her ? [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r watched her smile and talk . [SEP]
[CLS] he noted each time her eyes dropped to his mouth and saw the flu ##stered look in her face . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d stopped caring about his guards and was completely focused on him . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew she wanted him to kiss her but he held out , enjoying the fact that she was suffering a small amount of what he was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] but her being a virgin , she had no idea what he was going through . [SEP]
[CLS] one had to know the ecstasy of release to understand the power and all ##ure that the sexual act could be . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he gave in to her not so subtle messages . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come here , victoria , ' ' he said , his voice soft and interrupting her sentence that she was fl ##ound ##ering to finish . [SEP]
[CLS] the food had all been put away and re - stored in the picnic basket . [SEP]
[CLS] so there was nothing to imp ##ede her from moving closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , she hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at the small distance between them , then up to his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth opened and her eyes glanced down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you need ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to come here , move onto my lap , ' ' he instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] he saw the burn start in her clear , green eyes even in the dark . [SEP]
[CLS] the pulse at the base of her throat sped up and he could tell that she knew exactly what he wanted to do to her . [SEP]
[CLS] well , not exactly , he corrected . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought he only wanted to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] and possibly that was all he would do . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was n ' t all he wanted to do . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` on your lap ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her voice barely above a whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did n ' t move , he pulled her around and settled her on his thighs , careful that she did n ' t feel the bulge of his man ##hood . [SEP]
[CLS] surely that would scare her off , running and screaming . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , he would let her feel what she did to him , how he wanted her . [SEP]
[CLS] but closer to the time when he would propose . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise , he did n ' t know what she would do . [SEP]
[CLS] he was afraid his desire would scare her away . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d have to teach her slowly , carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , right here , like this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rested his hands on her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` put your hands on my shoulders now , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] instantly , victoria did as he said but felt silly . [SEP]
[CLS] she just wanted to kiss him . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he bent his head and touched his lips to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] at the first touch of their lips , her breath exhaled , her eyes closed and she let her mind rev ##el in the wonderful , exciting feeling of kissing him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` open your mouth , ' ' he said softly , still rubbing his lips against hers , caressing her and watching her face to see the reaction he had on her . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved to see her face respond , to feel the shivers run through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s hands were gripping his shoulders , her mouth im ##itating his . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the fact that she could move her tongue , mating with his and her body arched into his . [SEP]
[CLS] her breasts felt heavy and her nipples painfully hard as they pressed against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands forgot to hold onto his shoulders and crept up to tangle in his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] with one swift movement , victoria was no longer sitting on his lap but was on her back , his large , muscular body pressing her down while his mouth moved from hers to travel across her jaw , stopping on her ear and victoria whimpered in pleasure , her hands holding his head where it was . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was stronger than she and her hands were no match for him , his head traveled to ni ##bble on her neck , sending sparks shooting throughout her body . [SEP]
[CLS] and still he moved lower . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s mouth nu ##zzled , the strap of her sun ##dre ##ss out of the way , his mouth moving across her shoulder , ni ##bbling the sensitive flesh revealed . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria felt like her body was on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] every place dh ##ar ##r ' s mouth traveled , small sensations of desire sparked through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] molten lava filled her veins instead of blood and she tried to hold herself still , not wanting to reveal to him what she was feeling inside , but her body was under his power . [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out when he touched her skin on her shoulder and her breasts were aching to have him touch them , but she was terrified just the same . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped , her eyes opening and searching for him . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted re ##ass ##urance but he simply moved away from her breast , returning to her mouth , kissing her until the resistance left her body and she was kissing him back , the moans and gasps returning as his hands touched her arms , her waist , her ears and shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] after several minutes , dh ##ar ##r pulled away , looking down into her face . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria tried to appear casual , like she ' d done this several times and was n ' t phased by the feelings ramp ##aging through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] but the reality was she was so excited but still so terrified she could barely think . [SEP]
[CLS] kissing a man like dh ##ar ##r , the aura of danger and power surrounding him , she was n ' t sure what to do , what he wanted her to do and knew she would never be able to live up to the other women in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she said , noting the anger on his face and tried to sit up . [SEP]
[CLS] but he did n ' t want that . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he leaned down over her again , his chest pressing into hers , pressing her back against the soft earth as she had been only moments before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you sorry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was terrified of him now . [SEP]
[CLS] he was angry and grit ##ting his teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] she could feel something about him that she could n ' t define and was terrified to even try defining . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i ' m not . . . . you know , ' ' she finished , not able to hold his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need more than i ' m . . . . ' ' she fl ##ound ##ered , unable to say the words that would push him away but knowing she could n ' t do this to him and be too scared to deliver . [SEP]
[CLS] what he made her feel was too intense and unfamiliar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never done this before , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and then reached down to help her to her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she was standing , he pulled her into his arms , looking down into her eyes that were wide with confusion and fear but he noted with satisfaction that her body was still singing with passion and she went willingly into his arms , despite the fact that she was afraid of what he made her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , you do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never . . . ' ' she looked down at his shirt , her fingers playing with the buttons there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never even . . . ' ' dh ##ar ##r waited patiently but when he understood that she was struggling with her embarrassment , he re ##lent ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve never kissed a man like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , already knowing the answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . . . but that was n ' t what i was going to say , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve never slept with a man ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested , putting his hand underneath her chin , forcing her to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that already , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to sing with relief but then her spirits sank . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i ' m so . . . pathetic , ' ' she said , wishing she ' d learned something from her past dates . [SEP]
[CLS] something that would show him that she was n ' t so silly and naive . [SEP]
[CLS] he gripped her shoulders gently but his words were hard as stone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never apologize for being pure , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] never ! [SEP]
[CLS] it is a great gift you will give to your husband . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her as if he wanted to say something more but stopped himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust me , ' ' he ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and never apologize for that again , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` trust you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she repeated . [SEP]
[CLS] with a small laugh , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t really know you . [SEP]
[CLS] how can i trust you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her face which was not angry in any way but smiling up into his frustrated but controlled features . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you already do , ' ' he said , his arrogance revealed once again . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had to laugh but she still nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose i do , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come , you need sleep , ' ' he said , knowing it was almost midnight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what your plans are for tomorrow , ' ' he ordered as he started walking away , pulling her hand through his arms and heading in the direction of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] she started to walk with him but then pulled back , remembering their picnic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , the blanket and food ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she explained , about to forget everything after the way he ' d made her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her arm out from his but he stopped her , shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry about those . [SEP]
[CLS] they will be taken care of , ' ' he replied and pulled her hand back into his and started walking , ignoring the blanket and basket of food as he moved down to the sidewalk that lined the thames river . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me what you will be doing tomorrow , ' ' he ordered again . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria thought about her schedule with only a part of her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] the other half was looking backwards and , in the darkness , she saw one of his guards walk over to her blanket and fold it , then lift the picnic basket , hurrying towards the limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as they were out in the open , the other four guards formed a loose perimeter . [SEP]
[CLS] if she did n ' t know better , she would assume that they were just four large , bulky men walking along the river ##bank with the other tourists . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , answer my question , ' ' he stated stern ##ly , knowing she was concerned about the guards again . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her to learn to ignore them since she would soon be surrounded by them herself once she accepted his proposal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she said , turning back to him , surprised at the stern tone . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought quickly about her schedule the next day , ` ` i have four classes tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , exams are over but i have reports to write now for the end of the semester . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked her questions about her classes , her professors , the reports she was planning to write and how her exams went . [SEP]
[CLS] it sounded slightly like an interview but she did n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] she put it down to him just being curious about her life and what she did . [SEP]
[CLS] in a way , it was flat ##tering . [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered what he would say if she returned the interrogation . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a small silence as they walked the last few feet of the sidewalk and she worked hard to gain the courage to ask . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing tomorrow ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked when they ' d reached the car . [SEP]
[CLS] a guard sprung forward to open it and victoria was proud that she had n ' t just stepped forward to open it herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d remembered dh ##ar ##r ' s instruction earlier in the evening , thankfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have meetings all day tomorrow , ' ' he said simply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what kinds of meetings ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her onto his lap and shook his head , ` ` boring meetings with men that you do n ' t know , ' ' was all he would say before his head dipped to kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wanted to question him more about his meetings , after all , he ' d asked her very specific questions about her day , why should n ' t she do the same ? [SEP]
[CLS] but his mouth stopped her questions and she was just as happy to return the kiss , feeling safe now that they were in the back of the limousine and he probably would n ' t do anything too revealing to her with the driver only a few feet away . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r walked her to her door that night and kissed her one more time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me your mobile number , ' ' he said when he lifted his head . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly , she came back to earth and her mind started working . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mobile ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked stupid ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r liked the way she became flu ##stered after every kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] sm ##oth ##ering a victorious smile which she might mis ##int ##er ##pre ##t he waited a moment more , watching her beautiful green eyes focus before asking again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , give me the number so i can call you , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . . . i do n ' t have one , ' ' she replied , biting her lip nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] all her friends had a mobile phone but she could n ' t afford one . [SEP]
[CLS] she figured that the only people who would call her could do so on the regular lines which were provided by the school . [SEP]
[CLS] there had never been a need for the extra expense of a mobile . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s eyes looked down into hers , slightly surprised that someone would n ' t have a mobile phone in this day and age . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] instead of telling him the truth , she simply shrugged her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no need , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a need now , ' ' he said and stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have one delivered . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t like the sound of that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , really , there ' s no need i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he touched a finger to her lips , si ##len ##cing her with his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you walk around campus during the day and night and from what you ' ve just told me , you study in the library until it closes at midnight , ' ' he said swiftly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not to mention the fact that i want to be able to reach you when i have a free moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t contact you easily with the normal phone and i want to make sure you have some sort of security while you walk around campus . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria grimaced inwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] put that way , it sounded nice . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps she could cut back on some things and be able to afford the charges . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i ' ll look into it , ' ' she said , knowing she ' d spend several hours looking for the cheap ##est phone and payment plan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll do no such thing , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have one delivered to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i do n ' t know if i ' ll be able to afford . . . ' ' she started to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you will not worry about money , ' ' he interrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it will be taken care of . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t like the sound of that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but , i ' m not sure that ' s such a good idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she considered that if she could n ' t pay for it , there was n ' t any need for her to enjoy the luxury . [SEP]
[CLS] she liked living within her means and presents were meant to be small items like a scarf or gloves , not a cell phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , accept this as something that will put my mind at ease . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t like thinking of you walking alone at night . [SEP]
[CLS] are you free this weekend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , changing the subject as if the discussion was over . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wanted to argue with him but she allowed him to change the subject since it was more interesting anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this weekend ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think i ' m only studying . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have any plans that i know of at this point . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll pick you up friday night for dinner , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] with a small , hard kiss , he turned and left , leaving victoria smiling at the way he ordered her around . [SEP]
[CLS] he was used to getting his own way but , as she let herself into the suite , she was n ' t going to ignore her upbringing simply because he told her to . [SEP]
[CLS] the next two months were the most exciting of victoria ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r showed her all over london , bringing her to restaurants she ' d never even heard of but were the trend ##y spots to see all the exciting people of london . [SEP]
[CLS] there were only two moments to mar her happiness , both times , she gave in to him , afraid of his anger if she did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that he would n ' t hurt her in any way . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t want him to be angry . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to please him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a silly need that bubble ##d up in her each time he made a request of her . [SEP]
[CLS] the first time was the day following their picnic . [SEP]
[CLS] she was in her suite studying when the doorbell rang . [SEP]
[CLS] instantly , she rushed over to it , expecting scott as he was coming to study with her and help her with her art history class which she was struggling in . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d convinced her to sign up for the class as her one elect ##ive and now she was barely scraping by with a b when she ' d previously received only as in her other classes . [SEP]
[CLS] but instead of her gang ##ly friend , a bulky , dark and angry looking man stood in her doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` compliment ##s of ash ##ir , ' ' he said mysteriously , handing her a medium sized box and left . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , victoria was still standing in the doorway when scott walked up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , pushing past her and dumping his books on her sofa . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , ' ' she said warily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s all this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , looking at the open phone book and the notes filled with figures on her notebook . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked up from the box she was trying to open and saw what he was reviewing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , that , ' ' she said and dumped the box on the table , walking over to sit next to him on the sofa . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r asked me to get a mobile so i was researching prices . [SEP]
[CLS] but i really do n ' t know what i ' m doing , ' ' she said , putting her hand against her forehead in frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are so many types and convenience ##s , i ' m not sure what i need . [SEP]
[CLS] i mean , if all he needs is a way to connect with me , then why do n ' t i just get a very basic phone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i agree with you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t see you text messaging someone , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyway , i found a really good deal via the mail recently . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll bring it over next time and you can compare that rate with the other ones you have here , ' ' he said , indicating the air time minutes and costs she ' d sc ##ri ##bbled all over the paper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think mine is a little better than these rates . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was relieved . [SEP]
[CLS] she could understand and read people but when it came to technology , she just got lost in the masses of possibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` great . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t imagine getting hooked on it like you and marcus are , ' ' she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hate talking on phones in the best of times . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s why there are computers , dear ##ie ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed , knowing that it was easier to send her an electronic message since she was writing her reports all the time now until the end of the semester . [SEP]
[CLS] he rarely bothered to call her anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , well that settles , it , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now teach me about this modern art stuff because i just do n ' t get it , ' ' she exclaimed , seriously doubt ##ing he could reveal the significance of the art to her . [SEP]
[CLS] they just looked like b ##lo ##bs on a paper , or sometimes streaks . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t understand why they told a story or showed the emotions of the artist . [SEP]
[CLS] an hour later , they were still going over the pictures as scott pointed out characteristics to her when the box started ringing . [SEP]
[CLS] both of them looked up at the same time , looking over at the ringing brown box . [SEP]
[CLS] then , as if in a comedy , they turned to face each other , their mouths open in a round o , both wondering what the phone was going to do . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think it ' s a bomb ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked , warily . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria scoffed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why in the world would you say something like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , but the memory of dh ##ar ##r ' s guards flashed into her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked back at the box as it rang again . [SEP]
[CLS] getting up , she picked up the box and found an edge to the paper . [SEP]
[CLS] tearing it open , she found a sophisticated mobile phone ringing over and over again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how do i turn it on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , understanding that dh ##ar ##r had sent it to her despite her claim that she would handle it herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , ' ' he said , standing up and coming over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] the phone did n ' t stop ringing for several minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] they both breathed a sigh of relief but a moment later , it started up again . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , scott found the right button and handed it to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said into the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria ? [SEP]
[CLS] why did it take you so long to answer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s eyes widened at his angry tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t open the box when it arrived so it was difficult to get into initially . [SEP]
[CLS] then i did n ' t know how to operate it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she saw scott ' s reaction to her instant ##aneous apology and turned away , not liking the concern she saw revealed in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me get this straight , ' ' dh ##ar ##r was saying , ` ` you received a box but did n ' t open it to find out what was inside ? [SEP]
[CLS] do you get gifts so often that they are nothing to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] she was surprised and a little hurt by his interpretation of the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it was n ' t like that at all . [SEP]
[CLS] i was just waiting for someone and got distracted . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s art history , you know . [SEP]
[CLS] i told you how difficult it was for me last night . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m trying to figure it out . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t usually get packages , i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] even victoria felt odd ap ##olo ##gizing like this . [SEP]
[CLS] had she lost her spine ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d done nothing wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] and why was she hiding the fact that the person who had come over was male ? [SEP]
[CLS] because she knew dh ##ar ##r would be furious . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have any proof , but she sensed that deep down , he was a very possessive male and knowing that he was from ash ##ir , she suspected he was very jealous and old fashioned . [SEP]
[CLS] studying with a man , even a gay man , would be forbidden . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , ' ' he snapped , apparently satisfied by her response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] all the anger was gone from his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m fine . [SEP]
[CLS] how are your meetings ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to make sure you liked your new phone . [SEP]
[CLS] is it okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] did they program it appropriately ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria walked into her small , galley style kitchen and bit her lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , i thought i mentioned that i would get my own phone , ' ' she said , looking out the window but not really seeing anything as she concentrated on making dh ##ar ##r understand her position on the mobile phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll have to accept this from me , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to know you are safe . [SEP]
[CLS] this phone has an emergency alarm on it if you get into trouble , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and it has my phone number already programmed in . [SEP]
[CLS] feel free to call me whenever you like , ' ' he said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go now . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you friday night , ' ' he said and run ##g off . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria pressed the button to turn it off and turned back to find scott sitting on the sofa again , looking at her with interest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m guessing that ' s your new love ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , one eyebrow raised in question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] that was dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and should i also assume you ' ve no need for the calling plan i mentioned earlier ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] a part of her wanted to assert herself to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] but another part of her knew that she only had a small amount of time with him and did n ' t want to spend it arguing about something so non ##sen ##sic ##al as a phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess not , ' ' she finally replied . [SEP]
[CLS] scott looked at her for another long moment . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he leaned forward and pulled the art history book closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s one your professor will probably have on the exam , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria considered explaining herself to scott but she did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she was eager to move on and pretend that the scene had n ' t taken place . [SEP]
[CLS] the second incident occurred about two weeks later . [SEP]
[CLS] she was on her way to the bookstore where she worked about ten hours a week . [SEP]
[CLS] the work gave her just enough spending money to buy what she needed in the way of books and supplies , plus a few minor extras if she was careful . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t being very careful lately , she thought as she entered the bookstore through the back where the employees entered . [SEP]
[CLS] she was spending more on her clothes and makeup just so she could spruce herself up for dh ##ar ##r when he phone ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] smiling at her manager , she was putting her coat away when her mobile rang . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she answered , knowing it was dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the only one who had the mobile ' s number . [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine had been thrilled to know she finally had broken down and gotten a mobile phone and had asked for the number so she could reach her for parties and such . [SEP]
[CLS] but victoria had refused to give it out . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t paying the air time on the phone so she did n ' t want to waste dh ##ar ##r ' s money on calls other than to him , regardless of how wealthy he was . [SEP]
[CLS] scott did n ' t even ask for the number and she felt his ce ##ns ##ure each time dh ##ar ##r called and scott was around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m in town unexpectedly . [SEP]
[CLS] come have br ##un ##ch with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was instantly disappointed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just about to start work . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t really meet you today . [SEP]
[CLS] how long are you going to be in town ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean , ' work ' ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , saying the word as if were dirty . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria hesitated , shocked by the instant anger in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned away from her co - workers who were joking about their classes while getting their bookstore apron ##s on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , i ' m sure i mentioned that i work in the bookstore a few mornings each week . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m equally certain that you did n ' t mention that . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll have to quit that job , victoria . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was stunned . [SEP]
[CLS] his tone brooke ##d no room for argument . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , sure she ' d misunderstood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t work , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t have it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled the phone away from her ear and stared at it as if it had grown a head . [SEP]
[CLS] putting it back to her ear , she said , ` ` did you just tell me that i had to quit ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s exactly what i said . [SEP]
[CLS] give me the address and i ' ll swing by . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t need to work . [SEP]
[CLS] if you need money , i ' ll give you an allowance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` an allowance ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she spit out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a child who needs an allowance . [SEP]
[CLS] i work just enough hours to buy what i need and i ' m not quit ##ting no matter how angry you get , ' ' she snapped . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to hang up on him , she was so furious . [SEP]
[CLS] the only thing that stopped her was that it would be extremely rude and her mother would be horrified at the breach in manners . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t challenge me victoria , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] his voice was n ' t angry but was deadly calm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` meet me for br ##un ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t have much time , ' ' he demanded again . [SEP]
[CLS] she was actually shaking with her anger . [SEP]
[CLS] no one ordered her around , no matter how handsome and charming he could be during all the other times . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] excuse me but i have to go now . [SEP]
[CLS] my shift is starting . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll call you when i ' m done . [SEP]
[CLS] goodbye dh ##ar ##r . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] without another word , victoria snapped the phone shut and shoved it into her pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] it started ringing a moment later but she simply turned off the ring ##er and shut it away in her locker . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##omp ##ing furiously out of the store ##room , she took the first box of books she saw and started she ##lving them . [SEP]
[CLS] how dare he speak to her like that ? [SEP]
[CLS] she fu ##med as she took the books out of the box and placed them on the shelf . [SEP]
[CLS] the others joked with her that she was doing the work of three people that day . [SEP]
[CLS] even her manager laughed , nodding to indicate that the statement was true . [SEP]
[CLS] all of them tried to find out why she was so angry but she simply helped the next customer in line or started stack ##ing books again , whichever was closest at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] she still had n ' t calmed down by the time she finished her shift six hours later . [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed her phone and started the long walk back to her dorm . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so angry , she did n ' t see the big , bu ##rley man following her , or notice when he made a phone call . [SEP]
[CLS] unlock ##ing her door , she was just about to toss her bag onto the floor and storm into her room when a dark shadow moved out of the corner of her eye . [SEP]
[CLS] gasping , victoria ' s anger disappeared , replaced by a desperate fear for her safety . [SEP]
[CLS] someone was in her apartment , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] frantically searching for the phone to call the police , her hand had just reached it when something in her head stopped her . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , dh ##ar ##r stood up and moved forward , his anger a physical force within the small common room . [SEP]
[CLS] she placed the phone back into the cradle and turned to him , trying to be angry but too relieved that it was just him and not a bu ##rg ##lar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you get in here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , backing up a step as he moved closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry about that , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you hung up on me , ' ' he stated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you di ##so ##bey ##ed me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was going to stand her ground , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t hurt her , she knew that so there was no need to be afraid of him . [SEP]
[CLS] lifting her chin , she stopped backing up and looked up into his angry , black eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i did . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not my father . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t follow your orders , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d backed down before but on this , she was making a stand . [SEP]
[CLS] it was too important . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet , ' ' he said and took a lock of her hair between his fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but soon , ' ' he stated , wrapping more of her hair around his hand , then pulling her head back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you may not work , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t allow it , ' ' he said a moment before his mouth descended to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] this kiss was not soft but it still captured her , throwing her into a state of desire so instant ##aneous it took her breath away . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands reached up to his shoulders and her body moved against his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you also made me wait , ' ' he ground out , and a moment later his hands captured her waist , lifting her up so she was eye level with him . [SEP]
[CLS] he pushed her back against the door , then pushed his body against hers , holding her there in that way , allowing his hands to move over her body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t ever do that again , ' ' he gr ##ated out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out when his teeth captured her ear , biting hard but the sensation was n ' t scary . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck , pulling him closer , mind ##less to the desire pool ##ing within her body , ending near her core and moist ##ening her underwear . [SEP]
[CLS] she was embarrassed that he had such power over her but there was nothing she could do to resist him . [SEP]
[CLS] each time he touched her , he controlled her completely . [SEP]
[CLS] he was always the one to end their kisses , leaving her almost begging for him to continue . [SEP]
[CLS] the only thing stopping her was the fear of the unknown , of his touch and the fear of what he might want from her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was terrified that she could n ' t deliver . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so dynamic and experienced , how in the world could she ever compare to the other women he ' d been with ? [SEP]
[CLS] and the feelings were too new , too raw and too overwhelming . [SEP]
[CLS] that day , he ' d ended the kiss with a growl and left her , standing in the middle of her sitting room looking confused . [SEP]
[CLS] the only words he said were , ` ` i ' ll call you when i ' m back in town . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , he was gone , leaving her shaking with un ##sat ##is ##fied desire and deep frustration over his auto ##cratic manner . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , she did n ' t need to quit her job , nor did she make any moves to do so , despite his order that she stop working . [SEP]
[CLS] she suspected that dh ##ar ##r took care of that himself . [SEP]
[CLS] her manager just slowly started cutting back on her hours . [SEP]
[CLS] so two weeks later , she had no income . [SEP]
[CLS] when he came to pick her up that night , she questioned him about it . [SEP]
[CLS] but he only changed the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] not having any proof , she could n ' t accuse him of anything . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the time spent with him was wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r took her to exciting places to eat or dance . [SEP]
[CLS] she went to almost every theatre for the wonderful productions and was thrilled at the end of each night when he took her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] he always kissed her until she was sense ##less , begging for something she did n ' t understand . [SEP]
[CLS] but he never took it too far . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much she writ ##hed in his arms , mind ##less with desire and almost crying out with the need for whatever was at the end , he never tried to touch her breast again . [SEP]
[CLS] finals were coming up and victoria was spending as much time as possible in the library studying . [SEP]
[CLS] the library was open all night on some nights , allowing students to finish their research and study during the final week . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria knew she ' d see dh ##ar ##r on saturday night and since she had no job , she allowed herself to sleep in , exhausted from being in the library until almost two in the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s meetings had ended earlier than anticipated and his first thought was to find victoria and spend the afternoon with her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost time to reveal her future to her and , on the flight to london that morning , he considered his plans . [SEP]
[CLS] at the idea of seeing victoria again , his body responded , painfully ready for her . [SEP]
[CLS] as always , he allowed the pain to filter into his mind , numb ##ing his body since the wanting was so intense . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d followed his plan exactly and now he knew that victoria was in the same state of almost constant arousal he was in . [SEP]
[CLS] just touching her now and her body responded without hesitation to his touch , his kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] the first time he ' d ventured towards her breast , she ' d been afraid . [SEP]
[CLS] now , he knew that when he touched her again , she would n ' t be afraid . [SEP]
[CLS] the desire within her was a fever , needing to be ass ##ua ##ged . [SEP]
[CLS] the fear would be gone and only the desire would be there . [SEP]
[CLS] it took less time than he ' d imagined originally . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d given himself two months , but after only six weeks , he knew he would have to move up the wedding date . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way he could wait another four months to have her . [SEP]
[CLS] and he knew that she felt the same way . [SEP]
[CLS] each simple touch and she was mind ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled grimly , knowing that moving the wedding date up would also help him . [SEP]
[CLS] he found himself thinking about her too often . [SEP]
[CLS] he attributed his lack of attention to the need for release . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t been with another woman since meeting her and now he too needed something . [SEP]
[CLS] but it could only be ass ##ua ##ged by victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] he would announce his engagement next week after revealing all to victoria tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] his plane landed and his driver made their way through the early morning london traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] it was towards the end of rush hour but still thick with london ##ers getting to and from their work place . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t call victoria this time , wanting to surprise her . [SEP]
[CLS] now that he ' d gotten her out of that awful , men ##ial job , he knew she ' d be where she should be . [SEP]
[CLS] in bed . [SEP]
[CLS] waiting for him . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea made his groin th ##ro ##b and he shifted uncomfortably before he could regain control . [SEP]
[CLS] he hurried up the steps to her apartment , wondering what she would be like right out of bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew she ' d be warm and sleepy , her long , sexy hair tumbled around her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] no makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] he liked that idea . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to see what she was like , pure and fresh . [SEP]
[CLS] there were many ways he wanted to see her and that was just one way . [SEP]
[CLS] writhing naked underneath him , begging for the release he would give her , on top of him , taking her time with him , the positions went on and on and he had to switch gears or the erection he seemed to continuously have now whenever he came near her , or even thought about her , would be embarrassing ##ly obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wanted to see her swell with his child , holding their son close to suck ##le at her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] ah , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d chosen well . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s beauty would go well with his strength . [SEP]
[CLS] she would help him produce the next heir to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled as he skipped up the last step . [SEP]
[CLS] he supposed he should tell her that she would be queen . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d like that , he thought to himself . [SEP]
[CLS] no more studying . . . . dh ##ar ##r ' s thoughts were halted abruptly when the door to victoria ' s suite opened just as he ' d lifted his hand to knock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] hello ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a tall , gang ##ly man was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r took in the man who was tall , but still a few inches shorter than he was . [SEP]
[CLS] he had obviously just rolled out of bed since his hair was messed up . [SEP]
[CLS] he was only wearing a pair of draws ##tri ##ng sweat ##pants and a torn tee shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] in his hands was a huge sandwich and a large grin on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you must be victoria ' s man , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the man asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ho ##ku ##m qu ##dam ##a , ' ' dh ##ar ##r replied , ignoring the outstretched hand the younger man offered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m here to see victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] is she in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] without waiting , dh ##ar ##r pushed past the man into the suite . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , hey , ' ' scott said , about to argue with the man who obviously needed a lesson in manners . [SEP]
[CLS] but he remembered that victoria was over the moon for the man so he held his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to have some red ##eem ##ing qualities if she loved him like she did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i say , she ' s still sleeping , ' ' he replied when dh ##ar ##r looked around the room . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s black eyes snapped back to the bed ##rag ##gled man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott could n ' t help it , he was getting irritated by the man ' s dom ##ine ##ering attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , she was up late last night and she ' s still sleeping . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to keep a civil tone but he remembered the one sided conversation about the phone several weeks ago and did n ' t like the man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about if you come back later ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s mind was spinning out of control . [SEP]
[CLS] what was this man doing in victoria ' s suite and how did he know that she was still sleeping ? [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r looked at the sofa but there was no sleeping acc ##out ##rem ##ents on it to let him know that the man had slept on the sofa . [SEP]
[CLS] the only other possibility was that he ' d been sleeping in victoria ' s bed . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea blasted through his mind , almost making him lose concentration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get out , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , the man understood dh ##ar ##r ' s anger and left , closing the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r walked to the door he knew was victoria ' s bedroom and pushed it open . [SEP]
[CLS] the sight he confronted blew away all doubt he had in his mind about what victoria had been doing last night . [SEP]
[CLS] he could see only ski ##mp ##y cotton underwear and nothing else . [SEP]
[CLS] the blanket was on the floor , obviously forgotten and only a thin sheet covered her nearly naked body . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs were sprawled out , and her hands were flat against the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the most sen ##su ##ous sight he ' d ever be ##held . [SEP]
[CLS] how could she have given herself to that man ? [SEP]
[CLS] what on earth would possess her to do such a thing he thought to himself . [SEP]
[CLS] but then the blame came back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d fired her passion one too many times , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' d had to find release somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been so firm in stopping before things got out of hand over the past six weeks and now she ' d sul ##lie ##d herself by giving her virginity to another man . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain that ripped through dh ##ar ##r was beyond anything he ' d ever felt before . [SEP]
[CLS] and as he looked down at the sleeping beauty , he wanted to in ##flict the same pain on her that he was now feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never hated anyone before , his power being so absolute that he could crush an enemy with little effort . [SEP]
[CLS] and now he would crush victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] he would crush her just as she was now crushing him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d make her pay . [SEP]
[CLS] with see ##thing fury , dh ##ar ##r closed the door and walked over to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even bother to take off his jacket or tie . [SEP]
[CLS] he just sat down on the bed , letting his weight roll her towards him . [SEP]
[CLS] the tiny scrap of material covering her breasts just made him ang ##rier . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only a small , cotton cam ##iso ##le and he could see her nipples through the thin fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , ' ' he said softly but enough to wake her up slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] her head rolled over and her hand pushed her mass of thick hair out of her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] blinking , she looked up sleep ##ily at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] to dh ##ar ##r ' s anger infused mind , her question only confirmed her guilt further . [SEP]
[CLS] to him , she was confirming her current lover ' s name before proceeding and it added fuel to the fire of his increasing fury . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do you have to ask ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand dove into her hair and pulled her face up to his for a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you so confused ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s eyes lost their sleep and became confused but a moment after his lips touched hers , her hands reached out and held onto his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her body up , wanting to be as close as possible to him , needing to feel him against her . [SEP]
[CLS] her soft moans only made him furious but he would n ' t re ##lent . [SEP]
[CLS] not yet . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand came down to touch her breast , the thumb rubbing it to a hard nu ##bb ##in through the cotton fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] he captured her cry in his mouth while his other hand slipped underneath the fabric , doing the same to the other nipple . [SEP]
[CLS] he heard her cries of passion but was mer ##ci ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled the fabric up and pushed her down on to the mattress , his mouth taking over where his thumb had been and victoria almost screamed out with the pleasure that was pulsing through her system . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ! [SEP]
[CLS] please . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to stop , ' ' she said but her hands were pulling at his hair , keeping his mouth in place instead of pulling away , contra ##dict ##ing her plea to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] soon though . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out , her legs spreading immediately when his hand reached down . [SEP]
[CLS] he pushed her underwear out of the way , his finger sliding against her clit ##oris and victoria inhaled sharply , painfully . [SEP]
[CLS] when his finger moved inside her and his thumb continued on in it ' s place , she could feel herself floating higher and higher . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth still covered her breast , suck ##ling hard , ni ##pping then soothing only to repeat the process while his finger and thumb created their own kind of magic . [SEP]
[CLS] without warning , victoria slipped over the cliff into an orgasm that was so intense , she almost black ##ed out , her fingers clenching and uncle ##nch ##ing in dh ##ar ##r ' s hair . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r had n ' t meant to give her a release . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d meant to raise the pressure , to increase her frustration to the same level that he was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] but her body was so responsive , so incredibly wound tight , that with almost no stimulation , she was shivering out her orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] the beauty of her climax was so perfect that he helped her through the final moments instead of pulling away as he ' d planned to do . [SEP]
[CLS] and right now , watching her eyes flutter open again , seeing the flush of satisfaction on her cheeks and feeling the liquid heat surrounding his finger , he wanted to rip off his clothes and sink into her , to find his own release . [SEP]
[CLS] but her next words stopped him , floor ##ing him yet again and straining his ability to control his anger to the breaking point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you do it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded harshly , pulling free of her and standing up . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria realized that he was completely dressed , not even his tie ask ##ew . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment earlier she ' d felt as if every bone in her body was relaxed and finally sat ##ed after weeks of frustration at his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] the bliss had been worth the wait , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] but the fury she saw in his eyes made her self conscious . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her cam ##iso ##le down and yanked the sheet over her legs , feeling dirty for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you sul ##ly yourself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rasped out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could have had it all . [SEP]
[CLS] and yet you decided you could n ' t wait . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sul ##ly myself ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she repeated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think that what i did sul ##lie ##d me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , the hurt coming through as she watched him look in the mirror and pat his hair back into place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many times ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many times ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she repeated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop repeating my questions , ' ' he snapped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many have there been ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria tried to sit up straight ##er in bed but her body just would n ' t cooperate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , could we start this conversation over again ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not following what you ' re asking me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r turned and looked at her fully , noting the pink ting ##e to her cheeks and the red lips , swollen from his kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d imagined her like this so many times . [SEP]
[CLS] but in all those fantasies , he was with her , both of them sat ##ed and feeling complete . [SEP]
[CLS] he told himself he only felt betrayed that she had given her virginity to another . [SEP]
[CLS] but looking at her now , remembering how instantly her body had con ##vu ##ls ##ed around his finger , he wondered if she was more experienced than he ' d assumed . [SEP]
[CLS] she was obviously well tutor ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] so for the past six weeks she had been just acting on her part . [SEP]
[CLS] that in ##fur ##iated him . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed to leave before he did or said something he ' d regret . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodbye , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , you are no longer worthy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said and left the room . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t bother to close the door as he left and he did n ' t look back . [SEP]
[CLS] the painful memories came flooding back to victoria , forcing her feet to stop walking as she watched the tall , incredibly handsome man step out of the long , black car . [SEP]
[CLS] the guards were already positioned around him , forming the perimeter she ' d eventually learned to ignore . [SEP]
[CLS] the months after his departure from her life had been tor ##tu ##ous for her . [SEP]
[CLS] if it had n ' t been for jasmine and scott , pushing , teasing , na ##gging and generally just not allowing her to give into the depression , she would have failed out of school and not even cared . [SEP]
[CLS] the morning he ' d said those horrible words , victoria had broken down in tears that had n ' t stopped for two days straight . [SEP]
[CLS] neither jasmine nor scott could figure out what had been said so they did what they could to comfort her . [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine had gone to all of her professors and asked for an extension to her exams , explaining that some sort of tragedy had occurred although they could n ' t figure out what it was through the crying . [SEP]
[CLS] a week after he left , she took her finals , then wept for another week . [SEP]
[CLS] she passed , but just barely that semester , her mid terms and the strength of her research papers carrying her through with bs when she would normally have received as straight across . [SEP]
[CLS] the real slap in the face came when scott arrived on their doorstep one morning with a newspaper . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had been shower ##ing and came out to see scott and jasmine looking at an article . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked over , looked down and saw dh ##ar ##r staring out of one of the pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] the capt ##ion revealed so much about him , she was stunned she had n ' t realized the truth before . [SEP]
[CLS] the king of ash ##ir final ##izes oil leases for great britain the article stated . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all about how the negotiations had started to fl ##ound ##er about a month ago and all looked lost . [SEP]
[CLS] but some tricky negotiations had saved the day . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had closed herself in her room for the rest of the day , not coming out to eat or talk . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , she started living again . [SEP]
[CLS] she , scott and jasmine graduated , victoria with honors despite her awful semester involving dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine was now living with her current boyfriend but victoria had agreed to move in with scott . [SEP]
[CLS] he and marcus had split up by mutual agreement at that point . [SEP]
[CLS] now , five years later , scott was starting to make head ##way into the fashion industry . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the designs victoria had posed in had caught the eye of a magazine editor and there was the possibility of a layout for the following spring . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was a guidance counselor for an elementary school and loved it although she ' d never taken either scott or jasmine up on the offer of another blind date . [SEP]
[CLS] they teased her un ##mer ##ciful ##ly about her nun - like existence but she preferred to be alone rather than deal with the kind of pain love could in ##flict on a person . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d loved dh ##ar ##r with all her heart and soul , had shivered through her first orgasm with him and then was call ##ously rejected , told she ' d sul ##lie ##d herself and been informed she was no longer worthy . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t come forward , but stared at her through dark glasses , waiting for her to come to him . [SEP]
[CLS] for a long moment , she considered her options . [SEP]
[CLS] she could just stand here and stare at him . [SEP]
[CLS] or she could turn around the way she ' d come . [SEP]
[CLS] she could go home and call in sick , which would n ' t be a lie for she instantly felt sick with anger , both at herself and at him . [SEP]
[CLS] the other option , which seemed to be the most reasonable , was to walk straight through the front door of the school and ignore him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t feel very reasonable but she remembered that she had several appointments this morning . [SEP]
[CLS] the kids needed her . [SEP]
[CLS] their parents needed her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only a few days until summer vacation and she needed to help some kids so they would make it through the summer . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she refused to let dh ##ar ##r control another second of her life . [SEP]
[CLS] forcing one foot in front of the other , she eventually made her way to the front door of the building . [SEP]
[CLS] she was just two feet away when a hand whipped her around . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s face was just as handsome and hard as stone as she remembered it being . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you , victoria ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said . [SEP]
[CLS] she considered ignoring him , but at that moment , a noisy group of kids ran from the playground , heading into the school . [SEP]
[CLS] several of them stopped and gave her a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] mason ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they called out , then rushed through the doors , all excited about the upcoming summer vacation . [SEP]
[CLS] because she was surrounded by impression ##able children , she had to set the right example . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , your highness . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was all she would give him . [SEP]
[CLS] protocol probably required that she curt ##sy or bow or something along those lines , but she refused , not considering him worthy of the effort to even hold the door for him . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to walk into the school , furious when he fell into step beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look good , ' ' he said as they walked through the school ' s hallways . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' victoria replied , holding the door wide so five running boys could pre ##cede her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` slow down , mike , ' ' she called out . [SEP]
[CLS] then walked through the door herself and pretended he was n ' t there as she walked to the office to sign in for the day . [SEP]
[CLS] she picked up her messages at the front desk and si ##fted through them , painfully aware of dh ##ar ##r standing next to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who ' s the hu ##nk ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] betty asked , eyeing dh ##ar ##r with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t smile but she knew she would have to introduce him . [SEP]
[CLS] doing anything else would only stir up the gossip mills even more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` betty , this is dh ##ar ##r qu ##dam ##a , ' ' she introduced , om ##itt ##ing his title . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , betty , the school secretary and resident flirt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled at betty since it was an ongoing joke that betty , who was seventy if she was a day , flirt ##ed with anyone with testosterone running through their system . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how do you do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r said , and formally bowed , kissing betty ' s hand rev ##ere ##ntly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is a pleasure to meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] betty actually blushed and batted her eyes at dh ##ar ##r ' s compliment and charm . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria controlled her eyes from rolling , but just barely . [SEP]
[CLS] she wished she could scream and st ##omp her feet but that would n ' t be a very good example . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you victoria ' s boyfriend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] one of the other office workers called out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` bout time , tory ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] another said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good one ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] yet another called . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just an old . . . ' ' victoria hesitated , wondering how she could describe someone like dh ##ar ##r . . . ` ` just someone i knew when i was in college , ' ' she finally finished . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria turned to face dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` perhaps you should come into my office and explain exactly what you want and then get out of here , ' ' she whispered harshly , hoping none of her co - workers overheard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` perhaps that would be best , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria led the way to the hallway and unlocked her office door . [SEP]
[CLS] the room was filled with books and stacks of papers everywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] there were stuffed animals and a beaten up old sofa that had definitely seen better days . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have a seat , ' ' she said , waving to the battered sofa , knowing he would n ' t dare sit down in it . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched in amusement as he perched on the edge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ' s up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , sitting down behind her desk and crossing her arms over her chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why the sudden appearance after five years , your highness ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there was suddenly a knock on the door and a small face appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the girl saw victoria , she rushed into the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] mason ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried and threw herself into victoria ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria held the little girl closely , rocking her back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] it was mary gregory and her father had died in a car accident a week ago . [SEP]
[CLS] her mother was struggling with the four older children and mary seemed to be getting the raw end of the stick emotionally . [SEP]
[CLS] they just sat there for what seemed like several minutes , then mary stood back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened , mary ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , forgetting about dh ##ar ##r ' s presence for the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just silly , ' ' she sniffed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` today is my father ' s bowling night and . . . . ' ' she broke down in tears but struggled valiant ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , victoria just held her again , letting the little girl cry out her grief . [SEP]
[CLS] after another five minutes , mary sniffed and took a tissue out of her pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ms . mason . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be fine now , ' ' she said and dried her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on back if you need to , ' ' victoria said , getting down on her knees so she was more at mary ' s level . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just do n ' t keep it inside , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] mary nodded and left , all without seeing or even sensing dh ##ar ##r standing in the corner of the office looking on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened to her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria snapped out of it and turned to face dh ##ar ##r , the tears still in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` her father died recently . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s having a hard time of it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was n ' t angry anymore now that mary had come in to diffuse the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d reminded victoria of what was important . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was n ' t on that list . [SEP]
[CLS] not anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a time she would have turned her life upside down to please him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had in fact . [SEP]
[CLS] but not anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want , your highness , ' ' she asked again , taking up right where they ' d been interrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you find out ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that you ' re the bloody king of ash ##ir and not some low ##ly oil lease ne ##go ##tia ##tor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded , getting angry about his deception even after five years . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ignored the ' bloody ' and nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , that would be the question . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the difference ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you just tell me what you want and then leave ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need your help , ' ' he stated . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wanted to laugh but looking at him , she knew that would n ' t be a good idea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t even know what i need , ' ' he said firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` should n ' t you wait to find out before you turn me down ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] if i remember correctly , you did n ' t need me five years ago , so why should you need me now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r lifted a large envelope and pulled out two pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , if you wo n ' t help me , will you help them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , tossing the pictures down onto the desk in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria picked up the first one , noting the bright , sunny face and the twinkle in the little girl ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked mischievous , victoria thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she flipped the page and a boy looked out at her from the paper . [SEP]
[CLS] he was too serious , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if the weight of the world were on his tiny shoulders already . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re cute , ' ' she said , pushing the pictures back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re in trouble , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] that got her attention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? [SEP]
[CLS] the boy maybe but the girl seems happy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` those pictures were taken six months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] their parents died a week after those pictures were taken . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , they ' ve become more and more withdrawn . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m worried about them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who is their closest relative ? [SEP]
[CLS] they should take care of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m their uncle . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stepped around the desk , skirt ##ing a pre ##car ##ious pile of papers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you hire someone to file ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked absently ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are n ' t real papers . [SEP]
[CLS] the un ##ti ##dine ##ss makes the children feel more comfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] i think they are all old test papers from about a decade ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that only confirms my instincts that i need you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go hire an expert . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i intend to . [SEP]
[CLS] when can you start ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not an expert in grief counseling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you understand children . [SEP]
[CLS] and mary just revealed that you are an expert in grief counseling . [SEP]
[CLS] she seems like she ' s adjusting quite well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at his watch and stood up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to leave for germany in an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] i can be back here to pick you up in three days . [SEP]
[CLS] will that be enough time ? [SEP]
[CLS] the children will be out of school by then so there should n ' t be any problem . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stu ##ttered out her outrage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problems ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about my life ? [SEP]
[CLS] how about my plans for the future ? [SEP]
[CLS] as of this morning , you and your problems did n ' t factor into them at all . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course there will be compensation , ' ' he said and bent over her desk . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote down a number on a piece of paper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if the children are n ' t any en ##tic ##ement , ' ' he said , ` ` this should do the trick , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are other pictures in the envelope . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be in touch , ' ' he said and left the tiny office without another word . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked down at her notebook and gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] the figure was three times her annual salary . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good grief ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] pushing that thought aside , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no way , ' ' she said out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] pushing the envelope to the side , she picked up her pencil and realized that her hands were shaking . [SEP]
[CLS] dammit ! [SEP]
[CLS] how could the man affect her like this after so many years ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d finally convinced herself that she was over him and then he just walks into her life , making things crazy again . [SEP]
[CLS] well , she would n ' t let him . [SEP]
[CLS] five years ago , she ' d jumped at his bidding . [SEP]
[CLS] any time he called , she ' d re ##lish ##ed the idea of spending any amount of time with him she could . [SEP]
[CLS] but not anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t do that to her again . [SEP]
[CLS] she told herself she was immune to his arrogance and charm . [SEP]
[CLS] she had the control . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 5 ` ` what ' s this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked , opening the envelope that had been sitting on her desk at home . [SEP]
[CLS] they shared a tiny flat in central london . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t the best part of town , but it was convenient to both their jobs which suited both of them just fine . [SEP]
[CLS] she was standing on a pedestal while scott pinned fabric around her body . [SEP]
[CLS] he was working on a design for a new dress for the magazine layout and she was acting as his model . [SEP]
[CLS] at the moment , her hair was piled on top of her head to keep it out of his way while he ni ##pped and tucked , putting the finishing touches on a sexy , sul ##try dress of soft green chi ##ff ##on that fitted her body so closely , she could n ' t wear anything underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank goodness you ' re boo ##bs are still per ##ky enough to pull this off , ' ' scott said , getting her attention finally . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been holding a file on one of her kids and had n ' t heard his original question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , smack ##ing his head playfully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not that old ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott ducked just in time to avoid the file coming down on his head . [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned un ##re ##pen ##tan ##tly before saying , ` ` i mean , you ' re such an old maid , one day , you ' re going to be forced to wear a bra when you choose something like this . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just grateful that you ' re not there yet , ' ' he teased . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked down at her breasts and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are fine , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m not aging that fast so just knock it off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least in this dress , they get a little showing off , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he continued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` since no one else has been seeing them lately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria rolled her eyes at the old argument , refusing to rise to the bait ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scott , just because i ' m not dating , does n ' t give you the right to critic ##ize my love life . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t remember seeing anyone in your bedroom lately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott took a pin out of his mouth and ni ##pped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but the operational word here is lately , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve had relationships recently . [SEP]
[CLS] what can we say about you , madam nun ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no need , ' ' she replied , hiding the pain of her morning encounter from scott by lifting her file folder up again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have a full enough life as it is . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no need to add a man into it and com ##pl ##icate everything , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost said , ` ` again ' ' but stopped herself just in time . [SEP]
[CLS] after dh ##ar ##r , she had n ' t wanted to meet any new men . [SEP]
[CLS] for a long time , she had n ' t been able to dr ##edge up any interest and then it took courage just to look at another man and consider his attractive ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] because each time she looked , she would compare him to dh ##ar ##r and find the man lacking . [SEP]
[CLS] it had taken over a year just to look at a man and not cr ##inge in disgust . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , she ' d decided she needed to get over him . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , she had n ' t found anyone to compare to him . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much she tried , unconscious ##ly , she still compared the men she met to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] so here she was , five years later and still a virgin . [SEP]
[CLS] much to jasmine and scott ' s frustration ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] and definitely not from their lack of trying . [SEP]
[CLS] at every opportunity , they introduced her to one of their new acquaintances , hoping she would take to one of them . [SEP]
[CLS] but not a single man she ' d met could hold a candle to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she told herself , why deal with the pain ? [SEP]
[CLS] it had been too hard getting over him last time . [SEP]
[CLS] why would any woman put herself through that again ? [SEP]
[CLS] jasmine jumped from man to man but victoria knew that she was n ' t the kind who could do that . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the emotionally committed kind , unfortunately , she grimaced . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , scott filled his mouth up with pins again and did n ' t have the ability to speak for several more minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was done , he sho ##oed her off to take the dress off . [SEP]
[CLS] but moments later , just as victoria was pulling on her underwear , scott opened her door , sitting on her bed while she finished putting on a bra and clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you never told me who these kids were , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled the pictures out of the envelope and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` poor little sp ##rite , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened to her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was used to talking about her kids at the school but the envelope just hurt her too much . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just some kids , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] the image of the little boy had haunted her all day . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked too serious , she thought again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the boy looks to be about five or six , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something like that , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had n ' t taken the time to get the children ' s ages from dh ##ar ##r but she supposed that scott ' s guess was accurate . [SEP]
[CLS] he took out another picture and read the capt ##ion underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but the girl is much younger . [SEP]
[CLS] about three ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose , ' ' she replied , zip ##ping the zipper on her jeans shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] scott looked up at her as she pulled a shirt on over her head , not bothering with a bra because it was too hot . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes narrowed as he looked at her , unused to seeing her this emotionally detached when it came to children . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , what ' s the deal ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re never like this about your kids . [SEP]
[CLS] spill it , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] scott was sitting at the top of her bed , leaning against the pillows that were stacked up against the head ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are the niece and nephew to dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she finally said , her back to scott so he could n ' t see her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re kidding , ' ' scott replied , sitting up and moving to the end of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you get these pictures ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked suspiciously , immediately knowing she was n ' t giving him the whole story because of the cage ##y look in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] and the fact that she would n ' t look directly at him . [SEP]
[CLS] sighing , victoria decided that she might as well spill the beans . [SEP]
[CLS] scott would eventually get her to tell it all and would n ' t stop pest ##ering her until she did . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r was at the school this morning , ' ' she admitted reluctantly . [SEP]
[CLS] scott whistled out his surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened to them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria took a deep breath , grateful that he was focusing on the children and not her reaction to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t exactly sure herself what her reaction to him was so she could n ' t really describe it to scott even if she wanted to . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` their parents died about five months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently , the kids are having a very hard time right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what are you going to do about it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked in the silence that followed her revelation . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria bit her lower lip and stared out the window , unable to face scott . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d see the pain in her eyes and she needed to be tough about this situation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing , ' ' she said firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] her words obviously surprised scott since he did n ' t respond immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] then she felt his gentle hug as his arms wrapped around her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , ' ' she said and stood up to leave her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] scott followed , watching as she pulled ingredients out for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was the cook generally since scott ' s only specialty was sandwiches . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not like you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is now , ' ' she said , pl ##op ##ping spaghetti sauce down on the counter and vegetables for grill ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' re not over him , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott asked , sitting down at the tiny table in the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the past five years are finally making sense now . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s the reason you ' ve never caught a fancy to any of the men i ' ve introduced you to , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria spun around at his words , ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] i got over him a long time ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raised one eyebrow at her heated reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ' s the problem with helping out his niece and nephew ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria squared her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] scott could psycho ##anal ##y ##ze her responses all he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t change her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just wo n ' t do it . [SEP]
[CLS] he thinks he can buy anyone and anything . [SEP]
[CLS] he offered me an astronomical amount to help out the kids . [SEP]
[CLS] but i ' m not for sale . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so do n ' t take the money . [SEP]
[CLS] what do you have to lose ? [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t have plans for the summer except to model for me , ' ' he grinned cheek ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could spend the hours writing that book you ' ve been talking about but you could do that in ash ##ir too without too much trouble . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he considered her for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nope , the only reason you wo n ' t go is because you ' re afraid of him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and walked out of the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re afraid you might fall back into his arms again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria followed him , her mouth trying to form words to deny scott ' s assertion that she was easy where dh ##ar ##r was concerned but he interrupted her before she could figure out how to deny his statement forcefully enough . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` by the way , i have a date , tonight so do n ' t bother making anything for me , ' ' he said and closed his bedroom door on her glare . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stomped back to the kitchen and put the spaghetti sauce and vegetables back into the refrigerator and walked out of the kitchen , furious with him and with the situation . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t hungry herself so if scott was going out , there was no need to cook . [SEP]
[CLS] left alone , she paced the room several times , trying to get her temper under control . [SEP]
[CLS] she flipped on the television but when nothing interested her , she flipped it off again . [SEP]
[CLS] a half hour later , scott swung out of his room , patted her head teasing ##ly and blew her a kiss before opening the door to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wow ! [SEP]
[CLS] de ##ja vu ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] scott said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s in the family room , ' ' scott said and disappeared down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] the hairs on victoria ' s neck started tingling and she swung around , terrified to see if her instincts were right . [SEP]
[CLS] and there he stood , in all his masculine glory . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was here , in her apartment , making it seem way too small when his overwhelming size entered it . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked around disdain ##fully , noting the mis ##mat ##ched furniture and worn out carpet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good evening , victoria , ' ' he said quietly and closed the door behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , crossing her arms over her chest , painfully aware of the clothes she was wearing . [SEP]
[CLS] the tee - shirt she ' d pulled on was old and at least two sizes too small but she had n ' t been expecting company . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relaxing for the night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his eyes moving down to her breasts which were thrusting through the thin fabric . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like your shirt , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could feel her nipples harden underneath his knowing gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want , dh ##ar ##r ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded , wishing she was n ' t blushing right now but not able to control it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i ' d already given you my answer earlier today . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , you mentioned you were flying to germany . [SEP]
[CLS] why are you still here in london ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walked into the room , looking around at the various pieces of furniture . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it was n ' t the right answer , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when it is , then i ' ll accept it . [SEP]
[CLS] and i did fly to germany today . [SEP]
[CLS] now i ' m back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her hands were fists at her sides by the end of his announcement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are in ##fur ##iating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you are as beautiful as i remember you being . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned to look into the tiny kitchen but it obviously did n ' t interest him overly much since he turned back to face her again quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you married him ? [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t notice a ring on your finger so i ' m guessing you have n ' t yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , feeling caught off guard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your boyfriend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` boyfriend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r sighed and looked at her impatiently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the man who just left . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scott ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` marry him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that is what some people do , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole scene was out of some sort of bizarre movie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] we have n ' t married . [SEP]
[CLS] yet , ' ' she added . [SEP]
[CLS] if he thought she was going to marry scott then maybe she could have a little pride left . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t left her with much last time . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r raised one eyebrow at her call ##ous reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` either you ' re committed to him or you ' re not , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] after all these years , are you so fi ##ckle that you ca n ' t make up your mind ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he definitely had a low opinion of her , did n ' t he ? [SEP]
[CLS] she walked away , intending to go into her room and put on a different shirt but he stopped her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ground out , holding her wrist in a punish ##ing grip . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked into his black eyes and wanted to slap him . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t dare . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m fi ##ckle . [SEP]
[CLS] i just do n ' t want to settle down with one man , dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] i like variety and i like men . [SEP]
[CLS] so why settle for one man when i can have a whole banquet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r looked down at her beautiful , furious face and wanted to kiss her soft lips . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to pull off the tiny shirt she was wearing and feel the soft , perfect texture of her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if the old feelings he had for her , the painful sexual frustration was back and more powerful than ever . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been with many other women since he ' d last seen victoria but none had been able to ease the frustration within him . [SEP]
[CLS] something inside him made him realize that nothing would until he had this one woman . [SEP]
[CLS] after so many years , he still wanted her with a painful desire . [SEP]
[CLS] so when his niece and nephew had started showing signs of problems , victoria had come to mind . [SEP]
[CLS] he would solve two problems at once , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much he det ##ested her morals , he knew she could help the kids . [SEP]
[CLS] and he would make sure she helped him along the way too . [SEP]
[CLS] it was time for him to settle down but he could n ' t do that until he ' d ex ##or ##cise ##d the demons of his past . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least one demon - in the form of the del ##ect ##able victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , he did n ' t have to slow down as he had all those years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d definitely gotten over her fears of sex , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she was obviously living with a man and admitted that she liked variety . [SEP]
[CLS] well , he ' d give her variety , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d make love to her so many ways she would n ' t be able to think straight . [SEP]
[CLS] and when he ' d finally gotten her out of his blood , he would toss her aside and find someone suitable to becoming his queen . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , it was a nice , neat plan . [SEP]
[CLS] kill two birds with one stone , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] the hand holding her wrist softened and he stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to start his plans , he needed her on his own turf . [SEP]
[CLS] using intelligence and charm would be better than anger , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] and if that did n ' t work , he did n ' t object to paying for what he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , had n ' t life taught him that women were basically all prostitutes ? [SEP]
[CLS] they all wanted something from him . [SEP]
[CLS] even if it was simply bragg ##ing rights , none of them turned down a pretty tri ##nk ##et , did they ? [SEP]
[CLS] he just needed to find her price . [SEP]
[CLS] so start negotiating , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so , do you need help packing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s eyes narrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not listening , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you earlier that i ' m not going . [SEP]
[CLS] there are experts all over the world who can help your niece and nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] pick one and leave me alone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ran a finger down her arm , the gentle caress creating a shiver in her body that she remembered so well . [SEP]
[CLS] and he felt it , smiled over it . [SEP]
[CLS] that shiver meant that she still felt all the old chemistry they ' d shared before and it was just as strong now as it had ever been . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but as i said , i need the best . [SEP]
[CLS] i need your compassion and direct ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] these kids have been hurting for so long , it is going to take some real caring to get through to them . [SEP]
[CLS] from the very first moment i met you , i ' ve been impressed with your way with children . [SEP]
[CLS] it is extraordinary , to say the least . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t like the warm glow that eased into her heart at his words . [SEP]
[CLS] but she pushed that feeling aside , knowing how good he was at getting what he wanted , whether he was telling her the truth or just words so she ' d fall into his plan . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` flat ##tery will get you no where , ' ' she said , crossing her arms over her chest again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not enough money ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about double what i offered you previously ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s mouth dropped open . [SEP]
[CLS] she was stunned by the amount of money he was offering her for only a three month job . [SEP]
[CLS] but then she remembered that he was a king . [SEP]
[CLS] and a king to one of the wealthiest countries in the world with oil reserves so deep and vast that they were as yet un ##ta ##pped in some cases . [SEP]
[CLS] straightening her shoulders , she looked him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t get it , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t like you . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , you ' re going to have to get someone else to help you in this case . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not the right currency ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r turned around and fingered the dress that was now laying across the back of a chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this looks nice . [SEP]
[CLS] it should be on the cover of some magazine , should n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s eyes narrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded , knowing that scott ' s hopes were flying high now that there was the possibility of a magazine layout . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think i mean , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re boyfriend only has a layout potential . [SEP]
[CLS] think about what it would do for him , for your future with him , if he were to get the cover of the magazine instead ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] how did he know that an editor was interested in scott ' s designs ? [SEP]
[CLS] was he bluff ##ing ? [SEP]
[CLS] there was nothing on paper yet . [SEP]
[CLS] either party could back out , not that scott would even think of doing that . [SEP]
[CLS] the layout meant a real beginning for him and his designs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have that kind of influence ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , praying that it was true . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r walked over to her , standing less than an inch from her del ##ect ##able body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not only do i have the power and influence to get him the cover , i can make the layout disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] i can also make your job disappear , ' ' he said , watching her eyes widen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve done it before when you crossed me , did n ' t i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it took several seconds for his words to sink in . [SEP]
[CLS] but when they did , they hit her just like a slap across the face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you bastard ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the bookstore did n ' t lose business . [SEP]
[CLS] you had me taken off the schedule ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] i told you to quit . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to watch her face , noting the furious expressions . [SEP]
[CLS] he said softly , ` ` do n ' t cross me , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i can be your best friend , or your worst enemy . [SEP]
[CLS] and that of all your . . . friends , ' ' he said , he ##sit ##ating on the last word . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked over to the door and opened it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your last day of school is wednesday . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll send a car to pick you up on thursday morning . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint me , victoria . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , she was standing alone in the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] her anger turned to shivers and then into full blown fury . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , she just sat down on the sofa and cried . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t released so much energy on emotions since he left her that morning and she swore she ' d never let another man hurt her that way again . [SEP]
[CLS] now that very same man was here , in her life , turning it upside down . [SEP]
[CLS] and possibly hurting others if she did n ' t do as he said . [SEP]
[CLS] around midnight , she slipped into her room , not wanting scott to come back from his date and see her like this . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been through enough emotional up ##hea ##val ##s from her to last a lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t need another . [SEP]
[CLS] and he did n ' t need his career to be ruined before it even got started if she could do anything to save it . [SEP]
[CLS] if it was ruined , it would be all her fault anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r would see to that . [SEP]
[CLS] life just was n ' t fair , she thought to herself as she watched the dawn slowly rise over the horizon . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d wr ##ack ##ed her brains trying to come up with a way to get out of this but each time she came up with a solution , she fell again . [SEP]
[CLS] it all came down to dh ##ar ##r ' s threat to ruin scott . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t really care about herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she could head back to her parents farm and help out the kids in her old village . [SEP]
[CLS] there were plenty there who needed help . [SEP]
[CLS] but scott did n ' t deserve this . [SEP]
[CLS] he finally had a chance and dh ##ar ##r was threatening to kill it before it started . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 6 after a sleep ##less monday night , her body shut down after school on tuesday . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , wednesday night , she was too nervous to sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] she kept packing and rep ##ack ##ing her bag , changing her mind on what she would need to bring . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , she packed a suitcase full of jeans and shorts with simple tee - shirts , sandals and tennis shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] at the last minute , she packed a few sun ##dre ##sse ##s , not sure what she would use them for but feeling better and more prepared now that they were in her suitcase . [SEP]
[CLS] she was going to be with the kids . [SEP]
[CLS] everything she packed was more practical than flat ##tering . [SEP]
[CLS] her sole mission was to help two small children who needed help . [SEP]
[CLS] stripping her suitcase free of any flat ##tering outfits made her feel good . [SEP]
[CLS] at least dh ##ar ##r would know that she was there for them and did n ' t have any feelings for him . [SEP]
[CLS] not even the need to please him . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched the long , sleek car pull up to the curb and lu ##gged her heavy suitcase down the stairs , not waiting for someone to come up and get it for her . [SEP]
[CLS] in the back of her mind , she knew it would in ##fur ##iate dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] five years ago , he ' d taught her how to allow others to do things for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always been uncomfortable with it but had done it to please him . [SEP]
[CLS] now , she was n ' t out to please him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was only here for the kids so his opinion on how to act in front of servants was not her concern . [SEP]
[CLS] the driver jumped out of the car and tried to take her suitcase . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , thank you , ' ' she said , pulling it along behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' ll just pop the boot , i ' ll store it away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the driver was dumb ##founded and did n ' t know what to do for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he got his wits and raced ahead of her to unlock the boot . [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to lift her suitcase for her , but victoria again shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no need , ' ' she laughed and lifted it into the storage space by herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see , ' ' she said , dustin ##g off her hands efficiently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all done , ' ' she explained . [SEP]
[CLS] the driver then tried to rush over to the door but victoria again ignored him and opened the door before him , letting herself into the limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] the hard voice that greeted her startled her . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost fell onto the seat as dh ##ar ##r said , ` ` it seems you ' ve forgotten all the lessons i taught you five years ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria flushed . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d thought he was only sending the car . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t realize that he ' d be picking her up . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , she rallied over her surprise at seeing him again when she was n ' t expecting to . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never was a good student at silly , pointless lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] but perhaps the teacher was n ' t very good , ' ' she suggested , raising her eyebrows in challenge . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s response to that was to raise one eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` perhaps you just need a ref ##resh ##er on everything i taught you , ' ' he suggested , his smile was lethal in its charm and victoria blushed , knowing he was not referring to how to let the servants help her but about how to please him sexually . [SEP]
[CLS] well , while kissing anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d never gotten to the sex part of things . [SEP]
[CLS] at least he had n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] her blush intensified when she remembered that morning and the things she ' d let him do to her . [SEP]
[CLS] her complete surrender was at his fingertips and he knew it . [SEP]
[CLS] his deep chuckle indicated that he was thinking the same thing . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sat back against the plush seats , looking away from him , ignoring him as she watched the london skyline rush by outside the darkened windows . [SEP]
[CLS] space , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she just needed to keep her distance from him . [SEP]
[CLS] then everything would be okay , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] and she needed to remind herself that she was here for the children . [SEP]
[CLS] they were what really mattered . [SEP]
[CLS] the car bypassed the regular airport entry ##ways and continued on to a restricted area . [SEP]
[CLS] the car pulled right up to a private plane . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s jaw dropped when she saw that it was n ' t just a private jet , but a ju ##mbo jet , two stories ! [SEP]
[CLS] good grief , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to get out ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r asked beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or are you telling me that my company inside this car is more pleas ##urable to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria snapped out of her shock and realized that the door had already been opened for her by one of his waiting guards . [SEP]
[CLS] she slipped out , and waited for him to guide her into the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] she intended to follow behind him , not wanting to assume anything but he put a hand to her elbow and led her onto the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t stop until they were in the back , then he led her through a closed door , saying something in arabic to a man standing outside . [SEP]
[CLS] there , he waved her to a chair and she strapped herself in , uncomfortably aware that they were in a luxurious bedroom , complete with king sized bed and a desk with a computer on it and comfortable chairs in front of and behind it . [SEP]
[CLS] this room was bigger than her whole apartment , she realized . [SEP]
[CLS] the flight was uneven ##tf ##ul as dh ##ar ##r took several calls , inter ##ming ##led with telling her about his niece and nephew , about his brother and sister in law and how they died . [SEP]
[CLS] he also talked about the govern ##ess who was in charge of the kids and the woman ' s routine for the children . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria suspected that the first thing that was wrong was the govern ##ess and her strict rules but she bit her tongue wanting to observe before she pronounced anything solid . [SEP]
[CLS] the flight took less time than she thought it would and within what seemed like only a few hours , they were touching down in ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked out the window , watching the desert country pass by the windows . [SEP]
[CLS] it was beautiful in its harsh ##ness and she was impressed that so many people had been able to create a home for themselves under these conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] but the houses were large and there was a thriving city in the capitol , she realized as the car passed through the town . [SEP]
[CLS] there were five other limousine ##s and a police escort as they made their way to the palace . [SEP]
[CLS] once inside the impressive and int ##imating palace , victoria was led down several hallways that looked to be lined with gold , they glitter ##ed so brightly . [SEP]
[CLS] she was completely lost by the time dh ##ar ##r opened a double set of doors to reveal a large , air ##y school room . [SEP]
[CLS] inside , there were two small children sitting at desk ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the doors opened , both children and a stern looking woman stood up and bowed . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria bowed back to them , not sure what the protocol was in this instance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stand up , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said harshly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are bowing to me , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , ' ' she said , and a smile appeared on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s black eyes sliced over to her face and showed her his displeasure . [SEP]
[CLS] but victoria was n ' t looking . [SEP]
[CLS] her attention was focused on the two , terribly sad looking children staring back at her . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r said something in arabic that she did n ' t understand but then reverted to english again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` may i present , ari ##na and baja ##n , ' ' he said and the small girl and boy bowed politely to victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and their govern ##ess , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] matt ##ingly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the three previous occupants of the room only stared at victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] two small pairs of eyes watched without emotion and the other with what victoria would later learn was hostility . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously , dh ##ar ##r had n ' t given the govern ##ess any fore ##war ##ning that victoria was coming , nor did he tell anyone why she was here . [SEP]
[CLS] without any additional explanation , dh ##ar ##r nodded curt ##ly to the children and ms . matt ##ingly before addressing victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i shall leave you to your studies , children , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said formally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , report to me daily on your progress , ' ' he said and left the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll expect to see you tonight at dinner , ' ' he called out to her as the door closed . [SEP]
[CLS] with that , he left , the double doors closed behind him by a waiting servant . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stood there , wondering what in the world she was supposed to do . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted a progress report by tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at her watch and figured it was almost lunch time in ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] the quiet in the large school ##room after dh ##ar ##r left was eerie . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , ms matt ##ingly cleared her throat and straightened her already ram ##rod straight spine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we should get back to our studies , children , ' ' ms . matt ##ingly said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take your seats , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you will excuse us , ms . [SEP]
[CLS] mason ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria knew that the govern ##ess did n ' t want her there but the children did n ' t seem to mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' ll just stay and listen , if you do n ' t mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the govern ##ess pursed her lips but nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` open your books , children , ' ' she instructed . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria watched as the children struggled with their lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart went out to the small children who were sitting so still in their chairs . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had never seen a three year old sit still for hours like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na should be outside , running and playing , screaming and singing songs in order to learn . [SEP]
[CLS] the memo ##rization ms . matt ##ingly preferred just was n ' t as effective as touching and playing and doing , victoria thought . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria watched without interrupting for the rest of the afternoon but her heart was breaking when she saw that ari ##na ' s eyes looked dead and sad . [SEP]
[CLS] no more mischief within their deep , brown depths . [SEP]
[CLS] and baja ##n was just as serious as she ' d thought from his pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , ms . matt ##ingly closed her books and declared it quiet time . [SEP]
[CLS] both children stood up and started walking . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stood up and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ms . matt ##ingly , would you mind if i spoke to the children ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] the govern ##ess walked over to stand next to the children . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' she said and waited . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` alone , ' ' victoria emphasized when the straight laced woman showed no signs of leaving the children for a moment without her guidance and strict discipline . [SEP]
[CLS] that was not the woman ' s choice but pursed her lips and left the room . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked at the two small beings and their sad , pain - filled eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that was a lot of learning today , was n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , sitting down on the floor and hoping the children would do the same . [SEP]
[CLS] they simply stood next to her , momentarily looking at her like she ' d lost her head , but then going back to their dead eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] even a momentary emotion was good , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like to sit down ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked . [SEP]
[CLS] the girl thought about it but then rejected the idea but did n ' t say a word , just shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] the boy did n ' t dei ##gn to reply . [SEP]
[CLS] he obviously had a great deal of his uncle in him and sitting on the floor was simply an unacceptable thing to do , according to the disdain ##ful look in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was und ##eter ##red . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that ' s okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i was hoping you both could help me to pro ##no ##unce your names . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not very good at your language yet , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria slaughtered their names but the children just politely explained the correct pronunciation without any sort of change in their features . [SEP]
[CLS] it took almost an hour of being silly before victoria finally got a half smile out of ari ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n did n ' t even blink at her si ##llin ##ess . [SEP]
[CLS] ms . matt ##ing ##lly came back and excused the children , explaining that it was time for the children ' s bath time . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria followed along , knowing that she was n ' t wanted but un ##car ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] at the first sight of the children when she ' d walked into their school room , victoria knew that she was doing this for them , and no longer to protect scott from dh ##ar ##r ' s retribution . [SEP]
[CLS] she went through the rest of the evening with them , ending the day in the children ' s dining room where she told silly stories of the animals on the farm she ' d grown up on and the antics of her sister as well as her father who had been known to crack a joke or two when the nights were bitterly cold and there was nothing else to do but stay close to the fire after feeding the animals . [SEP]
[CLS] the children did n ' t smile , but at least they paid attention . [SEP]
[CLS] once they were in bed , victoria was exhausted . [SEP]
[CLS] all she wanted to do was so ##ak in a tub and go to sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] but she remembered dh ##ar ##r ' s order that she update him on her progress during dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] she considered ignoring the order but gave in only because he was their legal guardian and victoria knew that he had a right to hear what she thought of their pre ##dic ##ament . [SEP]
[CLS] she asked a servant where to find dh ##ar ##r , wanting to get her ` ` report ' ' over with for the day . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was told he would be in a meeting until later that night , victoria was secretly relieved to have the burden of facing him taken off her , at least for the first day . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a small rep ##rie ##ve but one she embraced nonetheless . [SEP]
[CLS] she was instead led to a suite of rooms where she found her luggage . [SEP]
[CLS] there were three rooms in total and all of them were huge and beautifully decorated . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a bedroom , a sitting room and a bathroom , all decorated in soft shades of pink , white and cream . [SEP]
[CLS] in the bedroom , there was an enormous bed covered in silk sheets and thick , fluffy blankets , stacked high with pillows of all shapes and sizes against the head ##board that was also covered in pink silk . [SEP]
[CLS] just outside the bedroom was a sunken living room , filled with comfortable looking sofa ##s and chairs , centered around a marble coffee table . [SEP]
[CLS] a fireplace was along one wall and curtains shielded what she suspected were windows . [SEP]
[CLS] but the best part of all was the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] walking in , her eyes were drawn to the huge , sunken bath ##tub . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all white marble with pink accents and a shower with several jets right next to the bath . [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed as if every bone in her body ached from the stress of the past four days . [SEP]
[CLS] ever since dh ##ar ##r had re - entered her life , nothing had been the same . [SEP]
[CLS] even her enjoyment of the last few days of school had been tormented with memories of the times she ' d spent with dh ##ar ##r so long ago . [SEP]
[CLS] hoping for some relief from the tension , victoria turned on the bath ##tub and stripped out of her worn jeans and shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] adding bath salts and bubbles from an assortment of items on the side , she slipped into the quickly filled tub . [SEP]
[CLS] the water was perfect and she laid her head down on the cushion ##ed end , closing her eyes and letting the stress so ##ak out of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] she was thinking about dh ##ar ##r and the children and dh ##ar ##r ' s hands , trying desperately to keep her mind from re ##li ##ving the details of dh ##ar ##r ' s kisses and touch from five years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] would it be the same ? [SEP]
[CLS] would she still react ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t going to find out , she determined . [SEP]
[CLS] she would stay away from him and only report to him in a formal sense . [SEP]
[CLS] all discussions about the children could be conducted in his office , if he even had an office . [SEP]
[CLS] she frowned , wondering where the man conducted the state business . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps there was some sort of throne room . [SEP]
[CLS] a shiver went through her . [SEP]
[CLS] that thought brought home the reality that the man really was royalty . [SEP]
[CLS] a king ! [SEP]
[CLS] good grief , what had he ever seen in her ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been so naive and trusting . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe that was why he ' d considered her ' un ##worthy ' . [SEP]
[CLS] sighing , she pushed the memories and uncomfortable thoughts from her mind , knowing she ' d never have the answers . [SEP]
[CLS] his opinion of her did n ' t matter anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] soothing herself by moving the water around , forcing her mind to think only of the children and not of their incredibly handsome , dynamic , arrogant and dom ##ine ##ering uncle , she eventually started to relax . [SEP]
[CLS] the door closing in the outer room alerted her that someone had entered . [SEP]
[CLS] but who on earth would come in ? [SEP]
[CLS] probably only a maid coming to turn down the bed , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] could they not know that she was already in here ? [SEP]
[CLS] or had she just imagined the noise ? [SEP]
[CLS] when she did n ' t hear anything else , she chalk ##ed up the weird sensation to fatigue . [SEP]
[CLS] she closed her eyes and relaxed , telling herself that no one would dare enter her rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] security at the palace was extremely tight so she was safer here than she would be at home . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relaxed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s deep voice said from the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sat up so quickly the water splashed around , creating waves that sl ##osh ##ed over the side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing in here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded , looking for a towel to cover herself . [SEP]
[CLS] fortunately , the bubbles were still thick enough to hide her naked ##ness from him . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned ne ##gli ##gent ##ly against the door frame while he watched her in the bath ##tub . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you i wanted a daily report . [SEP]
[CLS] you missed dinner , so i decided to find you instead . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t miss dinner , ' ' she gasped , pulling the bubbles closer to her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i asked a servant where to find your office but they said you would be in meetings for the rest of the night . [SEP]
[CLS] and i can come talk to you later . [SEP]
[CLS] please leave , ' ' she said em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] she was trying to sound assert ##ive but she knew her voice just sounded breathless . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of obey ##ing her command , dh ##ar ##r pushed away from the doorway and walked fully into the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he took one of the marble seats covered in soft , pink silk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you think of the children ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , looking like he was completely relaxed as he asked about his niece and nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria swallowed hard , searching the bubbles for holes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , please , ca n ' t we have this conversation in a few minutes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her in the tub and raised one eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you so nervous ? [SEP]
[CLS] do i make you nervous ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it that you ' d prefer me to climb in there with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sat back , eyeing the towels that were sitting right next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` could you just hand me a towel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out his arm , extending the towel to her but not getting up to deliver it as she ' d hoped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` happy to ob ##li ##ge , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] in order for victoria to reach the towel , she ' d have to get out and walk the ten feet to him . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way she would do that in her present , naked , state . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sat back , glaring at him . [SEP]
[CLS] if he was n ' t bothered by their situation , then she could at least pretend she was n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t give him power over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re niece is wonderful but needs to smile more . [SEP]
[CLS] your nephew is a piece of work , wrapped in stress and wondering how he can shoulder the awesome responsibility of raising his sister all on his own . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r blinked at her statement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but he does n ' t need to do that , ' ' dh ##ar ##r countered . [SEP]
[CLS] she raised her eyebrows at him , showing him her opinion of his perception . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you told him that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she argued . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r looked confused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] why should i ? [SEP]
[CLS] he knows that i ' ll take care of him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , he does n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] children are black and white . [SEP]
[CLS] their world only makes sense on their level , not necessarily on ours . [SEP]
[CLS] so in his mind , his mother and father are gone , that means he ' s the man of the house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r considered her words carefully and victoria was surprised when he did n ' t contra ##dict her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s an interesting perspective , ' ' he conceded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll think about what you said . [SEP]
[CLS] what will you do tomorrow ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sighed , thinking about the govern ##ess . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] can i spend some time playing with them alone ? [SEP]
[CLS] not just a small span of time but for perhaps half the day ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would you want to do that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked stunned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you get tired of them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled , understanding at last . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , you ' re one of those . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what of what ' those ' , ' ' he challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one of those people who thinks children should be seen and not heard ; and only at appropriate , limited times during the day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' he replied as if that was the most obvious thing in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria eyed him suspiciously but then saw the amusement in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no you ' re not . [SEP]
[CLS] you just do n ' t know any differently , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she refused to laugh , hating that he could still do that to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he could be a horrible tease , she remembered . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r chuckled and moved closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll admit that my parents did n ' t play with me much . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t think some com ##ming ##ling of adults and children would be inappropriate . [SEP]
[CLS] as long as you are there to supervise , ' ' he challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and walked closer to the bath ##tub . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was n ' t overly concerned , thinking he was actually leaving and she could get out of the tub . [SEP]
[CLS] it was becoming uncomfortably hot , what with the warm water and dh ##ar ##r ' s gorgeous body so close and his intense , sexy eyes watching her closely . [SEP]
[CLS] but he did n ' t stop his momentum towards the tub when she thought he should be turning towards the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , what are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , all the nervous ##ness she ' d been holding at bay came rushing back to the forefront now that he was much too close to the bath ##tub . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is time for you to get out of the tub , ' ' he claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped , watching his hand move to the fa ##uce ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you thinking of doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to let the water out . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re here as my guest and i am honor bound to take care of you . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let you become too water - logged , ' ' he explained as if that were the most obvious action in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you dare ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she squealed . [SEP]
[CLS] but he dared . [SEP]
[CLS] all the time . [SEP]
[CLS] with a simple press of a button , the drain to the bath ##tub opened up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped , frantically searching for a towel or a wash ##cloth , anything that would cover her up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s a towel beside the bench over there , ' ' he explained , still bending down close to the bath ##tub . [SEP]
[CLS] his dark eyes were filled with amusement and mischief and something she did n ' t dare define , too afraid it would be desire . [SEP]
[CLS] the water drained out of the tub and she watched in horror as dh ##ar ##r walked patiently over to the stack of thick , pink towels . [SEP]
[CLS] he unfolded the top one and held it open for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to have to come out sooner or later , ' ' he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a bastard , ' ' she said , glaring at him but still frantically watching the water which was quickly draining away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ' ve mentioned before . [SEP]
[CLS] now be a good girl and come out of there . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , you ' re not afraid of me , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria scooped up as many bubbles as she could , holding them in front of her pri ##ml ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t care how silly she looked but rushed over to the open towel . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried pulling it out of his hands , but his strong , muscular arms only closed around her , thankfully covering her up but now she had a new problem . [SEP]
[CLS] and this one was more painful than the last . [SEP]
[CLS] the towel was closed , covering up her naked ##ness but dh ##ar ##r ' s hands were holding it there . [SEP]
[CLS] his chest was pressed against hers and his arms were pulling her close , pressing her hips against his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can let go of me , ' ' she said breathless ##ly , worried ##ly looking up into his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i want to , ' ' he said , his eyes were staring at her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t , ' ' she said , knowing where his thoughts were going and hoping she could di ##ss ##ua ##de him somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] but even to her own ears her voice lacked conviction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t tell me you do n ' t wonder if it would be like it used to be between us , ' ' he said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you remember , do n ' t you ? [SEP]
[CLS] at the first touch of our lips , the heat would fire and you ' d be in my arms , begging me to touch you , needing the next step , but terrified of what that next step would be . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes were watching the flush steal into her cheeks and her mouth open slowly as she tried to form a response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know what that next step would be now , do n ' t you ? [SEP]
[CLS] and you want it , from me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t , ' ' she claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] he took one hand from her back and put it against the pulse beating on her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re lying , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wonder why . [SEP]
[CLS] why would you be so afraid of what we can share between each other ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i do n ' t like you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled at her adamant reply , knowing she was nervous about what he could make her body feel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that ' s the funny thing about chemistry , ' ' he soothe ##d , the hand touching her throat moved upwards , to rest against her cheek , stroking her full , lower lip sen ##su ##ously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it does n ' t really take our ' likes ' into account when revealing it ' s ugly head , does it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was starting to realize he was right . [SEP]
[CLS] she fought it , she really did . [SEP]
[CLS] but then his hand moved down from her back where it was holding the towel , he pushed the terry cloth away and rested against her skin instead , rubbing her skin and starting a fire wherever he touched . [SEP]
[CLS] at the first contact , victoria gasped and tried to arch away , but his other hand moved from her mouth , down to cover her breast , his thumb rubbing against the nipple through the thick terry cloth . [SEP]
[CLS] every sensation was coil ##ing inside her , pool ##ing in her stomach , then sending liquid heat between her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you feel it , do n ' t you , victoria ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] before she knew what was happening , the towel was gone and she was leaning against him , her naked flesh revealed to his fully clothed body . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt his erection against her stomach and a part of her was terrified , but she wanted him . [SEP]
[CLS] she accepted that she ' d never wanted any other man . [SEP]
[CLS] it was crazy but she could n ' t deny it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want me , do n ' t you , ' ' he said , whispering in her ear before ni ##bbling on her earl ##obe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not thinking about anyone else , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stopped cold with his words while all the frustration ##s of the past five years came rushing back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] why on earth would he want to know if she was thinking about someone else ? [SEP]
[CLS] then it came to her , his words earlier that she was sleeping with scott and he must think there had been others . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought she was prom ##is ##cu ##ous ! [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed away from him with all her strength and thankfully caught him off - guard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried and picked up the towel , throwing it around her and then rushing from the room . [SEP]
[CLS] she ran into the bedroom and stood there , shaking and waiting for him to come out . [SEP]
[CLS] when he did , her body started shaking even more . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked towards her , his stride determined and the look in his eyes telling her that he was furious . [SEP]
[CLS] she held one hand out in front of her while the other held the towel firmly in place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t come near me , dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve had this conversation before and i wo n ' t let you do that to me again ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , holding her hand out like a shield . [SEP]
[CLS] but he just took her hand in his and pulled her against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re fool ##ing yourself if you think you can ignore what is going on between us , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i allowed you room before but that was my mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] i learned from that adventure into hell . [SEP]
[CLS] believe me , i wo n ' t let us travel down that road again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he started to walk out of the room and then stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] turning back to her , he glared at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was he the first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was shivering so violently she could barely hold the towel . [SEP]
[CLS] his words did n ' t make sense to her sexually frustrated and terrified mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was who the first ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the idea that he ' d been fooled all along had eaten into his psyche for the past five years . [SEP]
[CLS] and now he had to know . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d suspected it for so long , suspected that she ' d only been string ##ing him along hoping for more . [SEP]
[CLS] but it had n ' t made sense . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t taken anything from him , even to the point of cooking him meals in an effort to maintain her side of the relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] good grief , she fought against even take a cell phone from him . [SEP]
[CLS] but he had to know if she really had been a virgin when he ' d initially met her . [SEP]
[CLS] had all her innocence and resistance to his position and wealth been a lie ? [SEP]
[CLS] was she really that good of an actress ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was that night the first time ' ' he demanded , ` ` or were there others before him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re insane ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she claimed , still not understanding what he was accusing her of . [SEP]
[CLS] a cruel smile twisted his mouth in response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re probably right but that still does n ' t answer my question , ' ' he stated em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` were there others ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not answering that . [SEP]
[CLS] it is none of your business . [SEP]
[CLS] it never was , ' ' she said , lifting her chin and glaring right back at him , refusing to give in to his intimidation tactics . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that she would n ' t tell him answered for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she condemned herself with her silence and that only in ##fur ##iated him further . [SEP]
[CLS] she would prefer to share her body with others rather than become his wife and the mother of his children . [SEP]
[CLS] turning on his heel , he left her , slamming the door in his wake . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 7 the following morning , victoria walked into the children ' s breakfast room a servant had directed her to and stopped short . [SEP]
[CLS] sitting at the table looking incredibly sophisticated and sexy , casually drinking coffee was dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was having a very serious conversation with his nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n was talking about his responsibilities and ari ##na was listening intently . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r nodded his head at certain points in the conversation but most of all , he allowed baja ##n to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] she stood in the doorway , feeling like an intruder but unwilling and unable to step back . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d mentioned last night that she suspected that baja ##n was taking on the responsibility of raising his sister alone and dh ##ar ##r had listened to her , actually listened ! [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s more , he was acting on that piece of information . [SEP]
[CLS] the pain twisting her stomach after last night eased somewhat . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria realized that whatever dh ##ar ##r thought of her as a woman , he respected her professionally . [SEP]
[CLS] and that was something . [SEP]
[CLS] and going from nothing to something was a head ##y experience for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she listened intently as baja ##n continued to talk and her heart went out to the little man who was discussing how best to take care of his sister and dh ##ar ##r nodded his head earnest ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n was serious but also very intelligent and well spoken for a boy of his age . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you have some good ideas , baja ##n , ' ' dh ##ar ##r was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but maybe you could let me help you with some of the issues you may be facing in the years ahead of you , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not saying that in all instances i should interfere , but perhaps i could guide you like my advisors guide me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n considered this and , after several moments , he nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would be grateful for your guidance , uncle dh ##ar ##r , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] once that was settled , dh ##ar ##r turned to face ari ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what is on your mind , little one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , noting that her govern ##ess was far enough away to not over ##hear the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like a dogg ##y , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] the words came out as if she knew that such an idea was forbidden . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria heard the words and she smiled secretly , loving the intent expression of the little girl . [SEP]
[CLS] but the expression on dh ##ar ##r ' s face was equally price ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a dogg ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said loudly and victoria understood his horror . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried not to smile but it was too precious to see dh ##ar ##r ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] she stifled a giggle and covered her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , what would you do with a dogg ##y ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , maintaining the serious facade . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na shrugged her shoulders and looked down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know , ' ' she revealed . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes , which had shown a small spark of excitement , died down and the sadness returned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe it was a silly idea . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r looked up , straight at victoria , obviously having known all along that she was there and listening to the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] his look was a call for help . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been doing so well up to that point and victoria hated to int ##rud ##e , but she understood that dh ##ar ##r did n ' t understand what he should say in this instance . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stepped into the room and sat down next to the little girl . [SEP]
[CLS] she started talking about her dog harry she ' d had at home . [SEP]
[CLS] turning to ari ##na , she suggested , ` ` do you want a dog so you can have something to keep forever ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na thought about it for a long time , then slowly nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] then in the middle of her nod , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but nothing lasts forever , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure i agree with that , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] four sets of eyes looked up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she concentrated on the small set of brown eyes that were looking up curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` think about it , ' ' victoria said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you miss your mother and father , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na nodded but she noted that baja ##n lifted his head slightly , fighting the need to reveal his pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but do you think about them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] again , ari ##na nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ms . matt ##ingly stepped in at that point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think this is an appropriate conversation , ' ' she snapped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i agree , ' ' dh ##ar ##r said . [SEP]
[CLS] but victoria ignored them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , think of your memories of your mother and father . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s the one thing you remember the most ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , turning to ari ##na first . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na looked to ms . matt ##ingly , then to dh ##ar ##r who slowly nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] given permission , ari ##na pursed her lips , thinking hard . [SEP]
[CLS] after several minutes , she whispered , ` ` bed ##time kisses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did your mother smell like ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` flowers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled encouraging ##ly , feeling a huge sense of relief that she was breaking through , even in a small way , with ari ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what did she feel like ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` soft , ' ' baja ##n stepped in . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na looked over at baja ##n , wanting to cry but knowing her brother would n ' t do it , therefore , it was probably inappropriate at the moment in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` think about those feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] i guarantee that they will last forever , ' ' victoria said . [SEP]
[CLS] she then clapped her hands together gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` know what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and all four sets of eyes looked up at her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your uncle has given me permission to play with you for the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] what do you think of that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , looking at both children . [SEP]
[CLS] both of them turned to face ms . matt ##ingly who nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if his highness has approved the interruption , then i suppose it is okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r stood up and bowed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i leave you both in ms . mason ' s hands . [SEP]
[CLS] mind your manners and behave , ' ' he said stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] when both children nodded in response , dh ##ar ##r turned on his heel and left the breakfast room . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as he left , ms . matt ##ingly also departed , although her body language conveyed the message that she di ##sa ##pp ##roved of the interruption to her daily schedule with the children . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na and baja ##n both stared at victoria who just grimaced after the stern lady ' s departure . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s pretty tough , is n ' t she ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] neither child agreed , nor would either of them crack a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can either of you show me to the play room ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , searching for something that would break through their silence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d rather not spend our short time together in the school room and i do n ' t know the palace well enough to suggest another place where we can get to know each other . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they led her down the hallway to a sunny , wonderful room filled with lovely toys for all ages . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a while , but eventually , victoria got them to engage in the toys . [SEP]
[CLS] as they played , she talked to them , getting them to slowly start to talk about their feelings and their grief . [SEP]
[CLS] but at lunch ##time , ms . matt ##ingly arrived and halted the play , escorting the children to the school ##room where victoria sat and observed , fu ##ming at the woman ' s need to control little people who were supposed to wr ##ig ##gle and sq ##ui ##rm . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of waiting for dh ##ar ##r to come to her that night , she sought him out , waiting outside his office this time until he finished his meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want another repeat of the previous night ' s interrogation . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , she did n ' t have much to report . [SEP]
[CLS] but she promised to keep trying . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the discussion was over , she hurried out of his office , almost running to her suite of rooms in order to avoid dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s how the whole first week went . [SEP]
[CLS] the children did n ' t open up very much , nor did she do so to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] she refused all dinner invitations , explaining that she ' d rather eat with the children but some nights , she ate in her own room , not able to deal with ms . matt ##ingly ' s stern ##ly di ##sa ##pp ##roving demeanor any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] saturday morning , ten days after her arrival , she had a breakthrough of the most amazing kind . [SEP]
[CLS] she was sound asleep when she heard the door to her suite open . [SEP]
[CLS] turning , she was about to pull the sheets up over her revealing tee - shirt when she heard the small footsteps . [SEP]
[CLS] it was ari ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] she was staring at victoria ' s sleep drugged face , tears streaming down her chu ##bby , beautiful cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , pulling the little girl into her arms , cr ##ad ##ling her and rocking her back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ari ##na , please tell me what ' s happened , ' ' victoria begged , genuinely worried about the small , shaking little girl in her arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i miss my mommy , ' ' she whispered as if it were an awful secret . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , dear . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m so glad , ' ' victoria said , pulling the child closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , sweetheart . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the child asked , looking up into victoria ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled through her own tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ari ##na there ' s no way anyone could lose their mother and father and not feel sad , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ' m supposed to be strong , ' ' she said , laying her head against victoria ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who said ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] if dh ##ar ##r or ms . matt ##ingly had said that to her , she would absolutely contra ##dict them . [SEP]
[CLS] but if baja ##n had given her that ad ##mon ##ition , then victoria knew she ' d have to step carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t want to hurt the impression ari ##na had of her brother ' s strengths , but she did n ' t want the little girl to keep the hurt inside either . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ms . matt ##ingly said so , ' ' the small voice whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she said we have to be strong and keep on working at our studies so we can grow up to be smart leaders . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria hoped the anger she felt for the govern ##ess did n ' t show on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked gently down at the small child in her arms and thought carefully about how victoria could ease the child ' s burden . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sometimes it is a good thing to cry , ari ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] being strong means revealing your feelings , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it means knowing that something is wrong and letting others help you , ' ' victoria said , sobbing herself now that ari ##na was crying out desperately , her pain wr ##ack ##ed body shaking with her grief . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , baja ##n stood next to her bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you mean it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , fighting the tears that were threatening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but uncle dh ##ar ##r does n ' t reveal his feelings , ' ' baja ##n argued . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could see that the boy was trying valiant ##ly to hold back his tears but she would n ' t let him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh yes he does , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just need to know how to read him , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t tell him that she herself did n ' t know how to read their uncle . [SEP]
[CLS] it was enough that the boy climbed immediately into bed with them and started crying . [SEP]
[CLS] the two children cried for over an hour , neither wanting to talk , just to be held and let go of the pain they had been living with for almost seven months . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , they fell asleep , baja ##n ' s hand holding onto his sister ' s arm but his other wrapped around victoria ' s waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na ' s hand was holding onto victoria ' s hand and both of hers were around each child . [SEP]
[CLS] that was how dh ##ar ##r found them . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been told by ms . matt ##ingly that the children had disappeared and the whole palace was searching for them . [SEP]
[CLS] some instinct had told dh ##ar ##r to look for victoria and he ' d find the children , but he had n ' t thought to look in her bed . [SEP]
[CLS] now , seeing the three of them , sound asleep , his heart ached and he let out a sigh of relief . [SEP]
[CLS] the children were safe and victoria was still here . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t analyze why it was so important that victoria was still within in the palace walls . [SEP]
[CLS] he just left her suite , closing the door softly behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] the summons came that afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been spending time with the children , not letting ms . matt ##ingly have them but simply playing with them in the play room and encouraging them to talk about their memories of their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked at the note written in dh ##ar ##r ' s strong handwriting . [SEP]
[CLS] it was simple and to the point . [SEP]
[CLS] he asked her to meet him in his office at her earliest convenience . [SEP]
[CLS] the odd thing was that he actually asked her to meet him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t an order . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria did n ' t like the nice tone . [SEP]
[CLS] it was too patient . [SEP]
[CLS] that just was n ' t like the dh ##ar ##r she had come to know she thought , holding the note in her hand while ari ##na carried a baby doll over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] what was he playing at ? [SEP]
[CLS] she decided to go immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t think she could stand the curiosity so she found a servant to watch over the children , then she left the school room and headed towards dh ##ar ##r ' s offices . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she arrived , she was waved into his office which was odd in itself . [SEP]
[CLS] was n ' t he in meetings or needing to finish up whatever he was working on ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was used to waiting for him , at least for a few minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] this im ##media ##cy was odd . [SEP]
[CLS] she entered and looked around , impressed despite herself . [SEP]
[CLS] the office was furnished in dark , heavy furniture but because of the enormous size of the room , it did n ' t look cl ##uttered . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole room was two stories high with floor to ceiling windows on each end looking out onto a courtyard . [SEP]
[CLS] his desk was the largest piece and was made of dark , polished wood . [SEP]
[CLS] it sat in front of a long wall of shelves filled top to bottom in books . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining wall had the doors to the outer offices as well as other doors that were mysteriously closed . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also large paintings of battles or portraits that were so perfectly rendered they had to be price ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] standing in the middle of all of this grande ##ur was dh ##ar ##r himself , looking more like a king than she ' d ever thought him to be . [SEP]
[CLS] it was scary to think that she ' d dated the man for more than six weeks , had kissed him and touched him , fell in love with him and learned so much from him but during that whole time , she ' d never known he was ruler to ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] now , looking at him in this amazing room , there could be no doubt about his role in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a ruler , born and bred . [SEP]
[CLS] it showed with every manner ##ism and posture . [SEP]
[CLS] how could she have missed all these things so many years ago ? [SEP]
[CLS] because if she ' d realized he was a king at that time , she would have run the other way . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t wanted him to be anything other than a normal man . [SEP]
[CLS] that meant that she was free to be with him . [SEP]
[CLS] each time she ' d started to think he might be more than what he was letting on , she ' d dismissed the idea as too far fetch ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] but deep down , she had n ' t wanted to acknowledge that he was out of her league . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good afternoon , ' ' he said , putting down the report he had been reading . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are your rooms adequate ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] this formal man standing before her was unfamiliar . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] they are very nice , ' ' she replied , just as formally . [SEP]
[CLS] why was he asking her this when she ' d been here for almost two weeks already ? [SEP]
[CLS] something was up . [SEP]
[CLS] she just could n ' t figure it out yet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] how are the children ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] this was familiar ground for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she relaxed slightly and considered all the issues she ' d un ##rave ##led today . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think they are fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i just left them in the school room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t like ms . matt ##ingly , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria hesitated for only a moment before reply ##ing , ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i think she is part of the problem . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in what way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , waving her into a seat . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria looked down and took one of the large , leather seats grouped around a coffee table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like some coffee ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , lifting an elaborate silver coffee pot , prepared to pour her some . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sat on the edge of her seat and looked around at the various paintings , the beautiful furniture , anywhere but at the handsome but completely intimidating man in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think she is a perfectly adequate teacher for older students but for a three year old and a six year old , they need to be more active . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never seen children that age sit still for so long . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyebrows came down into a straight line across his dark eyes , as if he disagreed with her on this point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is n ' t that a good thing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes whipped back to his and she answered , ` ` of course not , ' ' without thinking of a more diplomatic reply . [SEP]
[CLS] he was surprised , but did n ' t take issue with her immediate contradiction as she had anticipated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please explain . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she needed to choose her words carefully so he would understand . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na and baja ##n needed her to be able to get through to dh ##ar ##r so they could be free of their strict , daily routines . [SEP]
[CLS] she started off slowly , ` ` children that age need activity . [SEP]
[CLS] their brains do n ' t work the same way an adult ' s does . [SEP]
[CLS] they need to see , hear , feel , possibly taste the things they are learning . [SEP]
[CLS] the more ways a person absorb ##s the information , the better it will stay in their minds . [SEP]
[CLS] rot ##e memo ##rization is n ' t the best way to learn . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re very passionate about your ideas , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t remember you being this strong minded . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria flushed , thinking back at how pathetic she must have seemed , trying to please him at every turn . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess i ' ve grown up and developed opinions of my own . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t care if you do n ' t like it , ' ' she said , her chin lifting a fraction of an inch as a challenge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what if i do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] that confused her . [SEP]
[CLS] the admiring glance also made her warm inside but she ignored that feeling , knowing that he was just trying to charm her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not here to please you , dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] i know the rest of the world lives and breathe ##s to please you but you wo n ' t get that from me , ' ' she said , her eyes turning angry at the idea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but victoria , you please me a great deal . [SEP]
[CLS] just your beauty alone is lovely to look upon , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth dropped open and she had to look away from his sen ##su ##ous expression . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes were still hard , but they had a look that told her he was thinking about other ways she could please him . [SEP]
[CLS] his finger smoothed along his lower lip and victoria ' s mind wondered what it would feel like to have that finger touching her lip , caressing her body . [SEP]
[CLS] stop it ! [SEP]
[CLS] she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] it was pointless to go down that path . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way she was going back to him and besides , he had n ' t indicated that he was even interested in her in any way other than professionally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as i said , flat ##tery will get you no where , ' ' she said again and looked away . [SEP]
[CLS] her whole body was reacting to the thought of his touch , remembering the heat and the pleasure he could give her with only a simple touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyway , if there is nothing else , i ' ll get out of your way . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure you have plenty of work to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stood up and started to leave but his next words stopped her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` actually , there is one more thing , if you have a moment , ' ' he said , standing up with her . [SEP]
[CLS] that meant that their bodies were close and he looked down into her green eyes , holding her hand to stop her momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there is a function tomorrow night . [SEP]
[CLS] i was hoping you would be able to accompany me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her hand shaking within his . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r being arrogant and dom ##ine ##ering was hard to resist . [SEP]
[CLS] but dh ##ar ##r being nice and charming was devastating to her senses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do you need me there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are my guest and i was thinking it would give you a chance to meet some new people , enjoy the night and relax a little . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand more firmly within his and tucked it into his arm as he escorted her to the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but if you do n ' t think it would be a good idea , then i will find another woman to accompany me , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s eyes snapped up to look at his , trying to determine if he was serious . [SEP]
[CLS] when she just saw his blank , patient expression , she knew that he was n ' t bluff ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] her heart went into over ##drive . [SEP]
[CLS] the jealousy tearing at her was instant ##aneous and blinding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are seeing someone ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , hoping he could n ' t hear the anger in her voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to pull her hand free and find the woman , do her physical harm . [SEP]
[CLS] it was shocking to know that she hated someone she had n ' t even met , did n ' t know even existed until this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] her feelings were ridiculous since she had no claim to dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] nor did she want one , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] but there was no denying the jealousy tearing her up . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r noted the anger in her eyes and instantly recognized it as jealousy , just as he ' d suspected and hoped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not seeing anyone at the moment , ' ' he reassured her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i need a companion for the night and was hoping you could help me in this instance . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine , ' ' victoria snapped , angry now that she felt such overwhelming relief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she replied more gr ##acious ##ly for fear that he would think she was doing this gr ##ud ##gingly and go find another companion . [SEP]
[CLS] she just could n ' t deal with the idea of another woman on dh ##ar ##r ' s arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be happy to help you out tomorrow night , ' ' she said quickly , adding a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what time ? [SEP]
[CLS] is it formal ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is formal but i ' ll have something appropriate for you to wear sent over . [SEP]
[CLS] there may be other events later in the week that perhaps you might help me with as well ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but if they become a burden , just let me know and i will find someone else to accompany me for those events . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria gritted her teeth and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no need . [SEP]
[CLS] the children go to sleep early and i can accompany you . [SEP]
[CLS] after all , i do n ' t have much to do in the evenings , do i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she felt good that she could turn down his offer of a dress . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she now knew he was a king with probably o ##odle ##s of money , she did n ' t want to be ind ##eb ##ted to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as for a dress , no need to have one delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i have something appropriate . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she waited for him to contra ##dict her on that subject . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past , he had been adamant that she accept gifts from him , even an allowance . [SEP]
[CLS] but even then , just as now , she wanted to stand on her own and not accept his money , even in the form of an appropriate dress for a formal event . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r bowed slightly and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i appreciate your help . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria smiled back but did n ' t bow . [SEP]
[CLS] she accepted his bow and left his office , an odd feeling in her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] she refused to identify the feeling as excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just nausea she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she held herself proudly until she got out into the hallway , then leaned against the wall , closing her eyes and shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what have i gotten myself into ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] hearing a noise at the other end of the hall , her eyes snapped open and she saw several people heading towards dh ##ar ##r ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] scrambling to pull herself together , she hurried back to her suite . [SEP]
[CLS] making a quick phone call , she left a message for scott , telling him he needed to send some dresses to her as soon as possible and the way to get them here . [SEP]
[CLS] she told him to send them via overnight mail and she ' d have them pressed once they arrived . [SEP]
[CLS] she was sure that there was a dry cleaning facility somewhere around here that would press the dresses quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] she just hoped scott got the message in time . [SEP]
[CLS] the next thirty six hours were the most stress ##ful of victoria ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] she received a package the following morning and sure enough , scott had sent her five different dresses . [SEP]
[CLS] she recognized all of them since she ' d modeled them for him in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] it meant they would all fit her perfectly since he ' d created them for her . [SEP]
[CLS] they were n ' t really wrinkled either but one of the servants promised that they would be pressed and back in her closet for the evening event . [SEP]
[CLS] that night , she chose a mint green creation that was n ' t too revealing but hugged her upper body with soft folds , creating a v down the front and back , then fl ##aring out into a graceful cascade of mint green chi ##ff ##on to the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] it was very romantic looking and was one of her favorites . [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered how scott had had her hair done for the photo shoot and tried to rec ##reate it , but in the end , she just left the soft curls hanging down her back and only lifting the sides with small , green clips . [SEP]
[CLS] scott had hired a hair ##dre ##sser for all the photo shoots and , although the hairs ##tyle had looked easy enough to rec ##reate , it obviously was n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she was glad she ' d gone to all the trouble when dh ##ar ##r arrived to escort her to the party . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes flared as he took in her figure clad in the soft dress . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t say anything , but she knew that he liked the dress . [SEP]
[CLS] why it was so important for her , she was n ' t going to even think about . [SEP]
[CLS] he tucked her hand into his arm and walked her down the hallway , explaining that there were several ambassadors and their wives here for the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] he was entertaining them in order to work their treaties for better terms for ash ##ir and some of the negotiations had turned slightly sticky . [SEP]
[CLS] the evening turned out to be wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t sense any tension from the other guests in the room . [SEP]
[CLS] there were about fifty people , all fabulous ##ly dressed and loaded with jewels . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the older ladies were even wearing white gloves to their elbows which was a sweet throw ##back to the nineteen fifties . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d have to mention the thought to scott as an accessory to one of his newer creations . [SEP]
[CLS] what was more , dh ##ar ##r did n ' t let her out of his sight . [SEP]
[CLS] he kept her close , included her in all of the conversations and asked her opinion on several issues . [SEP]
[CLS] it was completely different from five years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] she had never been introduced to anyone important at that time and dh ##ar ##r had tried to mo ##uld her into the kind of woman he wanted her to be . [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed he respected her now , and liked what she had to say . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the night , victoria started to become nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s hands were touching her back and , although she tried , she could n ' t contain a shiver of excitement over his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to be excited . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to be immune to his touch , his charm . [SEP]
[CLS] once the last guest had departed , victoria tried to slip her arm out from his . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a bundle of nerves and she wanted nothing better than to slip into his arms and feel his lips on hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go , ' ' she said instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll walk you to your room . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , stopping him and putting a hand to his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] she immediately whipped it away , then took a step backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , thank you , ' ' she finally got out , biting her lower lip . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i insist , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , i can find my way to my room , ' ' she said and started walking down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] he fell into step beside her and walked with her anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] at her door , he turned her around but did n ' t kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he picked up her hand and bowed low . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for your assistance tonight , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i count on you again tomorrow night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria thought about how she ' d felt next to him all night . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been supreme ##ly conscious of him as a man and of all the women looking at him . [SEP]
[CLS] there were the looks of envy as well as those of approval . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d ignored all the jealousy , tossing it aside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , why do you need me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can work the room quite well on your own . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a step closer , trapping her hand between their bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes showed her the passion that had been tam ##ped down for her benefit . [SEP]
[CLS] but now , he did n ' t hide anything . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all there , letting her know that nothing had changed between them . [SEP]
[CLS] the chemistry was still intense and ready to be acknowledged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i want you by my side . [SEP]
[CLS] because i think you are incredibly beautiful with intelligence and wit . [SEP]
[CLS] and because if you wo n ' t accompany me , i ' ll have to find a replacement and that will make you jealous and , although there are many feelings i want to eng ##end ##er within you , that is not one of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her hand and then stepped backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you tomorrow night . [SEP]
[CLS] again , thank you for a lovely evening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria slipped into her room and almost fell onto her bed before her legs gave out on her . [SEP]
[CLS] what was it about the man that made him completely irresistible to her ? [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t she just think of him as any other man she ' d met ? [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was in a quan ##dar ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] being around him meant feeling things she knew were bad for her in both the short term and long term . [SEP]
[CLS] but if she did n ' t accompany him to these functions , he would find someone else . [SEP]
[CLS] and that thought just tore her up inside . [SEP]
[CLS] either way , she was doomed . [SEP]
[CLS] she would just have to be strong , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] the children had been fighting their emotions for so long , perhaps she could take a lesson from them ? [SEP]
[CLS] she could hide her feelings for dh ##ar ##r and the way his touch made her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , that would work , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 8 the next day , victoria arrived in the school room , dread ##ing the next passive aggressive confrontation with the sour govern ##ess . [SEP]
[CLS] but instead , she found ari ##na and baja ##n playing in the school room . [SEP]
[CLS] and laughing ! [SEP]
[CLS] they were actually laughing . [SEP]
[CLS] it was music to victoria ' s ears . [SEP]
[CLS] the servant , named gi ##ta , was down on the floor , doing a puppet show with them . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had no idea what they were saying since they were currently speaking in arabic , but she suspected it was just a silly play . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria found out that the severe ms . matt ##ingly was dismissed the previous day . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was grateful to dh ##ar ##r for really listening to her . [SEP]
[CLS] the evidence was in the fact that the children were currently laughing and enjoying themselves instead of sitting straight and learning something that was developmental ##ly beyond their abilities to comprehend . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , that meant that victoria would have to go see dh ##ar ##r yet again and thank him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to but she could n ' t think of an alternative . [SEP]
[CLS] she considered sending a note , but that seemed too imp ##erson ##al for what he ' d done for the children . [SEP]
[CLS] sighing , she knew she ' d have to seek him out and thank him . [SEP]
[CLS] bracing herself for being near him again , she started the long walk through the palace to his offices . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave herself a pep talk , trying to convince herself that she could be nice , polite , direct and grateful and not lose herself in the man ' s charm and char ##ism ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] she would maintain a distance of several feet , knowing that even a small touch from him without a crowd around her would make her body respond in ways that she knew were better left une ##x ##pl ##ored . [SEP]
[CLS] who was she kidding , she thought when she entered the outer offices and asked if he was available for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria grimaced inwardly , remembering how her body had reacted to his touch last night even when they were surrounded by fifty other people . [SEP]
[CLS] and she was excited about being with him tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him to keep her near , to feel his touch on her back and smile down into her face as he listened to her opinion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his highness will see you immediately , ' ' dh ##ar ##r ' s assistant replied as soon as he ' d announced that victoria was here to see him . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r watched as victoria walked into his office . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she was inside and the door closed behind her , he could see the war ##iness in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] and it made him feel good . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t like her being wary of him , but he knew that it was because of what he could make her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] slow , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed to take it slow . [SEP]
[CLS] she was like a tiny humming ##bird sipping the nectar but ready to take flight at the slightest sense of danger . [SEP]
[CLS] and instinctively , she considered dh ##ar ##r dangerous . [SEP]
[CLS] she was right . [SEP]
[CLS] he meant to have her . [SEP]
[CLS] one way or another , he would have her in his bed and would find out what he had missed out on all those years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] a small spark of anger fired inside his chest when he remembered that he would n ' t be the one to initiate her into the world of love making as he ' d wanted to so many years ago , but he would enjoy her body none the less . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps it was better this way , he thought as she slowly approached his desk where he was standing , watching her . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered her more beautiful now than she had been initially . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something about her , a maturity , a confidence perhaps , that only enhanced her love ##liness . [SEP]
[CLS] and back then , he was starting to feel something for her . [SEP]
[CLS] now , he would make sure it was only sex . [SEP]
[CLS] good sex , he told himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled and knew it was a ferocious smile because he was thinking of all the ways he would enjoy her incredible , sexy body . [SEP]
[CLS] she was smart too . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d made a good choice when he ' d gone after her to help his niece and nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] there had been many other people who would have done an adequate job . [SEP]
[CLS] but he ' d wanted her . [SEP]
[CLS] after seeing victoria with the children , he knew that her methods were much better than the govern ##ess ' s strict controls . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she said , stopping on the opposite side of his desk ` ` good morning , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] to what do i owe this unexpected visit ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , noticing that she kept her hands behind her back . [SEP]
[CLS] he suspected that it was because they were shaking but he did n ' t mind . [SEP]
[CLS] the action only served him more since it thrust her breasts outward , giving him a delightful view of their round firm ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just heard that you released ms . matt ##ingly from her contract . [SEP]
[CLS] is it true ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] you said she was part of the problem . [SEP]
[CLS] so she is no longer employed by me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria nodded , feeling wonderful that he accepted her advice so willingly and completely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m grateful . [SEP]
[CLS] and so are the children . [SEP]
[CLS] they were watching a puppet show put on by gi ##ta , one of the palace servants , when i left them . [SEP]
[CLS] they were laughing , ' ' she smiled , excited to tell him the news . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they were actually smiling and laughing , dh ##ar ##r ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , clasp ##ing her hands in front of her and almost jumping in her exciting news . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r grinned , more entrance ##d by her than by the news that his niece and nephew were progressing . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d known that would happen eventually . [SEP]
[CLS] children were res ##ili ##ent . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered correct ##ing her use of his first name but then rejected the thought . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d allowed her to call him that since their first meeting although no one else but his immediate family had that privilege . [SEP]
[CLS] he wondered if she knew how few people were allowed to address him that way . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t think she did . [SEP]
[CLS] nor would she care if he told her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s good news , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sure they are well on their way to a full recovery . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria flushed with pleasure at his praise and looked down at the desk , unable to hold his intense gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i guess i ' d better get back to the children , ' ' she said halt ##ingly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you still need help tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her eyes seeking his out , hoping that he did need her again . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated to admit it , but she was looking forward to seeing him tonight and feeling his arm around her back and waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , if you are still able to accompany me , i would be grateful for the assistance , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up , then down again , biting her lip in ind ##ec ##ision . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , then , i guess i ' ll head back , ' ' she said , feeling silly standing there looking at dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he just looked so incredibly handsome in his charcoal suit . [SEP]
[CLS] the jacket was tossed over a chair beside his desk but his crisp , white shirt stretched across his broad shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes dropped to his arms which were crossed over his chest , the cuffs of his sleeves folded back so she had a glimpse of his muscular forearms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was there something else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] he could see her eyes and knew that she was looking at him . [SEP]
[CLS] but would she dare to admit it ? [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned forward , his eyes giving her permission to look all she wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the end , she simply shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s all . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you tonight , ' ' she said quickly then turned on her heel and walked out of his office . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r enjoyed the view of her long legs and firm der ##rier ##e en ##cased in the slim fitting jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] when the door closed behind her , he finally looked away , smiling inwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him and that was obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] but how did he get her to act on those feelings ? [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r turned and stared out the window , considering all he had learned that morning . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her , that was a given . [SEP]
[CLS] but although she was making progress with the children , he was n ' t making any progress with her . [SEP]
[CLS] he had brought her here with the dual purpose of helping the children but also ex ##or ##cis ##ing her ghost . [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' d made no progress to date . [SEP]
[CLS] it was time to change that . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled mer ##ci ##lessly . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d said a few days ago that the children needed him to be around more often . [SEP]
[CLS] well , if that ' s the case , he would do it . [SEP]
[CLS] and if victoria just happened to be there as well , then he would make the best of that situation . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d listened to her advice so far and the children were recovering with leaps and bounds . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d just continue to listen , and act , on her advice . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wore a simple , black cocktail dress that night . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d pulled her hair back into a knot , tightly pinned at the base of her head . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled brightly to him when he arrived at her door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s the occasion tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , falling into step with him as he led her through the hallways of the palace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tonight is more relaxed , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is only a few ceo ##s and their wives who are old acquaintances . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you ' ll like them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` old acquaintances ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , hoping he would elaborate a little more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` college friends , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s lord alfred manning and his wife sarah and prince jeffrey asa ##m and his wife ja ##si ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] i went to school with alfred and jeffrey . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , ' ' she said , understanding but her nervous ##ness increased slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] this was n ' t an affair that he would need a companion , was it ? [SEP]
[CLS] and if it was n ' t , what did that mean about her presence tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] could he just want her to be with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] a delicious feeling swelled inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] and true to his word , the evening was definitely fun and relaxing . [SEP]
[CLS] they ate out on a beautifully decorated vera ##nda . [SEP]
[CLS] jeffrey and alfred were handsome and charming men who were obviously in love with their wives . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria noticed that the men did n ' t like their wives to stray too far , and their wives were n ' t immune to their husbands either . [SEP]
[CLS] the meal was delicious as usual and the laughter put victoria more at ease than she ' d been since dh ##ar ##r ' s arrival at the school . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved hearing stories about dh ##ar ##r and the trouble the three men got into while at oxford . [SEP]
[CLS] and if dh ##ar ##r treated her exactly like his friends treated their wives , she just accepted it , feeling included and accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 9 the next night , three startled eyes looked up from their picnic , worried ##ly watching dh ##ar ##r as he approached their blanket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good evening , ' ' he said , looking down on the little party . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you eating tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r asked , bending down to take the only available space on the blanket . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria tried to move out of his way , but his hands stopped her , keeping her right where she was , which was almost touching him along his leg . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##na spoke up , seriously telling him about hot dogs and potato salad . [SEP]
[CLS] it was their first experience tasting the american del ##ica ##cy and they were excited about the prospect . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm . . . i had that once , ' he said , looking into victoria ' s eyes , his own on fire with the memory . [SEP]
[CLS] he dipped a fork into the bowl and nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , no ce ##ler ##y , ' ' he confirmed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you . . . ' ' victoria started , only to stop when he winked at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember , victoria , ' ' he said softly , grinning at her in a teasing fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember a lot of things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria stopped staring at him , forcing her eyes to look away . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the whole meal , dh ##ar ##r ' s hand ` ` accidentally ' ' touched victoria in one way or another . [SEP]
[CLS] and each time , she felt the same electric current zip through her system . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the meal was over , she was breathing heavily and she could barely control the need to throw herself into dh ##ar ##r ' s arms and beg him to make love to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him . [SEP]
[CLS] desperately . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much she told herself that he was a bastard who had killed all the soft , tender feelings she ' d had for him five years ago , there was still the sexual chemistry between them . [SEP]
[CLS] it had always been intense , at least on her part . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d known he could control his feelings for her but she ' d been too new at the sexual games to understand what was happening to her . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , even after all these years and all the frank , open talk from others , she still was new to the game . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was an expert . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how much she tried to put herself out of his touching reach that afternoon , he found a way to brush her arm or knee . [SEP]
[CLS] he never looked at her , but each time it happened , her eyes snapped to his face , trying to determine if it was intentional or not . [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed innocent enough , but she suspected otherwise . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria almost yelled out a protest when one of the palace servants arrived to get the children ready for bed . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to be alone with dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t just the chemistry now . [SEP]
[CLS] being around him with the children , her heart had melted , seeing his tender care and understanding to the two small human beings that were aching inside for love and security and he just naturally gave it to them . [SEP]
[CLS] the depths of his personality struck her hard and she wished she had n ' t seen this side of him . [SEP]
[CLS] it only made the wanting harder . [SEP]
[CLS] when they were alone , victoria reached down to start cleaning up the picnic . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` leave it , ' ' dh ##ar ##r ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ignored his command and continued to clean up the food , storing it in the picnic basket . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r grabbed her arm and swung her around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you deliberately trying to ri ##le my temper ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , but she could see the amusement in his eyes as he held her wrists gently in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t believe in forcing someone to clean up after me . [SEP]
[CLS] i can clean my own mess ##es , ' ' she said and tried to pull her wrists out of his grip . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was useless . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you really do n ' t remember anything i taught you all those years ago , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she challenged , wishing she could control her heartbeat which was accelerating as he pulled her closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that i should ignore common dec ##ency and become a selfish bastard like you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t rise to the bait but only chuckled at her anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first of all , i ' m afraid i ' ll have to take away that one epithet from you , my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] i can give ample evidence of my legitimacy . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t despair though . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sure there are many other ob ##sc ##eni ##ties you can toss at me each time you reach the depths of frustration . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled as her eyes flared at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could see the wheels spinning in her mind as she tried to come up with another name to fling at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` second , there were many things i taught you . [SEP]
[CLS] if you ' re saying you ' ve forgotten , then perhaps i could ref ##resh your memory , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to step away from him but he held her firmly but gently , not giving her and inch of space . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down into her desire filled eyes , knowing that the sexual frustration was tearing her up inside just as it was doing to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , victoria , you ' re mouth says no , but your body is saying yes , is n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' she claimed and tried again to pull out of his embrace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which is louder ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , pulling her relentless ##ly closer to him , so close that she could feel his breath on her cheek , feel the beating of his heart under her hands as she tried to push herself away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was no use . [SEP]
[CLS] he was stronger and , although he was n ' t hurting her , she could n ' t break away . [SEP]
[CLS] and her body was already betray ##ing her , sinking in to lean against his hard , male strength , loving the way he felt against her softness and desire pool ##ing in her stomach , then lower . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t do this , ' ' she gasped when his hand released her wrist and moved down to her waist , one hand slipping under her shirt to touch the heated , overly sen ##sit ##ized skin underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his mouth bending to kiss her neck , finding the perfect spot that almost made her knees give out on her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because we do n ' t like each other , ' ' she said , her voice barely a whisper as he moved his mouth sen ##su ##ously against her neck and shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like you a lot , victoria . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no you do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] you think . . . . ' ' she could n ' t finish the sentence and her eyes fluttered shut at the memory . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not thinking now , ' ' he said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` except about how to please you . [SEP]
[CLS] how to touch you to give you the most pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] what would you like me to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] where should i touch you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could n ' t respond verbal ##ly but when his thumb found her nipple and moved gently across , she gasped , her hands gripping his shoulders as she was unable to stand any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard him laugh softly but could n ' t respond . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t wait . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted her in his arms and carried her down the hallway to her suite . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria had a small moment of sanity but by that time , he was already lowering her feet to the floor beside her bed and when she opened her mouth to protest , his own covered hers , ripping away anything she might have said in a mae ##ls ##trom of feeling and desire . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria whimpered as her shirt came over her head , leaving her with only her bra to cover her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t have time to become self - conscious as dh ##ar ##r ' s hands covered where the fabric had been only moments before , mass ##aging the heated , overly sensitive flesh that was swelling to fit into his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] her nipples were already hard and pointing so when his hand covered them , his thumb flicking over each one , she cried out with the pleasure that course ##d through her system . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] he lowered her body to the bed , but stood up to disc ##ard his own shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was thrilled , never having seen him without his shirt on before . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen other men , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] scott on a daily basis at times . [SEP]
[CLS] but no man she ' d ever seen could compare to the muscular beauty of dh ##ar ##r ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] the hair was spa ##ring across the top , then headed to a narrow point that disappeared into his pants . [SEP]
[CLS] with infinite tenderness , dh ##ar ##r reached down and pulled her jeans off her legs , his eyes lighting with fire when he saw her long , slender legs revealed to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she laid there in just her cotton bra and underwear , wishing she had something sexy on instead . [SEP]
[CLS] but dh ##ar ##r came down on top of her , his mouth moving to hers again and all her ins ##ec ##urities disappeared with the touch of his tongue against hers . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s hands reached out , curious and free at last to touch the man who had so fascinated her that she ' d never been interested in anyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] the muscles bunch ##ed under her fingers wherever she touched and she ran her fingers along his arms , his chest , into his hair and then back down to test the crisp hair on his chest , her fingers tang ##ling in it and then moving lower , following the interesting line that disappeared . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard dh ##ar ##r suck in his breath when she stopped at his belt . [SEP]
[CLS] he suddenly stood up and ripped his belt loose , his pants flying behind him before he came back to the bed , completely naked . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , he pulled her hand down to where it had stopped before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please continue , ' ' he said and his voice was hoarse . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was only too pleased to comply and her hand moved along his flat stomach , impressed with the ridges of muscles along the way . [SEP]
[CLS] but her hand stopped suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t go any lower . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes could n ' t even look to where his erection stood , hard and proud , waiting for her touch . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up at him , worried that she ' d been too bra ##zen . [SEP]
[CLS] but his eyes were closed , his teeth clenched in anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t stop , victoria , ' ' he rasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t tease me like this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with those words , her hand moved lower , her fingers touching the tip tentatively , worried that she might hurt him . [SEP]
[CLS] when she touched him , he let out a hiss of air and victoria pulled her hand back instantly . [SEP]
[CLS] only to have his own hand reach out and pull hers back , wrapping her fingers around him firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] when her fingers moved , dh ##ar ##r groaned and leaned forward , taking her nipple into his mouth yet again , sucking hard , moving the plain , white cotton away and teasing her nipple more . [SEP]
[CLS] with each ni ##p or suck ##le , victoria ' s fingers clenched harder or relaxed , depending on what he was doing to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she forgot what she was doing , lost in the desire he was pushing her into . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t realize that her fingers were driving him to distraction and he was losing his much prized control , the control that had been drilled into him from the moment he ' d had his first woman at the age of twelve . [SEP]
[CLS] here , with victoria ' s clumsy hands touching him , clenching at his flesh , he was no longer the experienced lover he ' d pride ##d himself on being . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt new and raw , overwhelmed with the desire to sink his aching flesh into her and pound until he found his release . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling her hand away , he grabbed both of her hands and lifted them over her head , determined to make her pay for wanting her so desperately . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought she was in control ! [SEP]
[CLS] well he would turn the tables . [SEP]
[CLS] no , he would control this experience and would show her that he was the ultimate lover . [SEP]
[CLS] he would make her forget all the other men she ' d had in the past and he ' d teach her what she ' d thrown away so call ##ously . [SEP]
[CLS] with her hands in one of his , he flicked the front clasp of her bra , releasing her perfect , beautiful breasts from the plain cotton . [SEP]
[CLS] his ind ##ra ##wn breath showed him that she was still in control and he hated that feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] lowering his head , he took her nipple in his mouth , moving his lips gently over the rosy peak , then sucking again , blowing his breath against her puck ##ered skin , then starting over . [SEP]
[CLS] when she started writhing beneath him , he moved to the other perfect mound , doing the same , smiling when she cried out and tried to pull her hands from his grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] but he would n ' t re ##lent . [SEP]
[CLS] not yet . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved down her body , kissing her stomach , his tongue del ##ving into her belly button and glory ##ing in the cries that came from the simple movement . [SEP]
[CLS] but he wanted more . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand moved between her thighs , first on the outside , then moving up the inside and he thrilled that she opened to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he could smell her arousal and it made him hurt even more . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was n ' t finished . [SEP]
[CLS] not yet . [SEP]
[CLS] one hand moved to her core , flicking her nu ##bb ##in and watching the flush steal across her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] he remembered how quickly she had found release the last time and almost gave in with the need to enter her , but he held back , wanting to show her again how good it could be . [SEP]
[CLS] his finger slipped inside her wet folds and he had to close his eyes to concentrate once he felt how wet she was , how ready for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want , victoria , ' ' he asked and his voice was rough , demanding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me . [SEP]
[CLS] does this feel good ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' she whimpered , still pulling at her hands that were in his grasp but settled on her stomach now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not yet , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r needed more . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t just want to feel , he wanted to watch , to taste it when she had her first orgasm tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] it had happened too fast the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , he ' d take her slowly into the pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue flicked over her folds and his hands released her wrists . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved between her legs , loving the feeling of her hands in his hair , pulling and pushing at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] and just like the last time , her orgasm was upon her before he could slow it down . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r watched , more aroused than he ' d ever been in his life as he watched and tasted her orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] when her cries died down , he moved up her body , kissing her stomach , moving upwards to caress her breasts with his hands , his thumbs , his mouth and tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no peace for her , he thought , winding her up for the next level . [SEP]
[CLS] and when her eyes opened in surprise , he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ve only just begun , ' ' he said , pulling on a condom , and held her hands over her head again as his body slid up against hers , his erection finding her softness and pressing inside . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her eyes , widening in shock and then in pleasure as he slid in deeper , filling her up . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a small restriction and dh ##ar ##r looked down at her , his throat con ##st ##ricting as he understood what it was . [SEP]
[CLS] but by then it was too late . [SEP]
[CLS] he broke through her barrier , noting the small twin ##ge in her eyes and stiff ##ening of her body before she relaxed again . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs moved up and wrapped around his waist and her hands pulled free of his , resting on his shoulders as he buried himself to the hilt . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was a virgin ? [SEP]
[CLS] it was madness surely . [SEP]
[CLS] impossible ! [SEP]
[CLS] but the evidence was inc ##ont ##rove ##rti ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] and now he was fully inside her , the only man to ever be in this position with this incredible beauty . [SEP]
[CLS] the responsibility he felt at that moment was awesome . [SEP]
[CLS] it had to be perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r started moving , slowly , sweat breaking out on his forehead as he moved , requiring only to give her the most incredible experience of her life . [SEP]
[CLS] he ignored his body ' s own need for release and simply moved to help her . [SEP]
[CLS] just as it had moments ago , her body responded , and within moments , her second orgasm was consuming her . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt her muscles tighten a moment before she screamed out , her nails biting into his skin on the shoulders and back . [SEP]
[CLS] he held back for only another moment , his pleasure increasing as he watched her mouth open and her body arch as the orgasm carried her off . [SEP]
[CLS] and then he could hold back no more . [SEP]
[CLS] he pounded into her silk ##en flesh , finding his release a few minutes later . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if all the tension of his life drained out as his body poured itself into hers . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the longest orgasm he ' d ever experienced and he held victoria close . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was all over , he rolled onto his back , taking her with him , still intimately connected . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands dove into her hair and he stared up at the ceiling , his breathing still ragged as he considered all the ram ##ification ##s of the past few minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , her head resting against his chest and her hand laying against his rapidly beating heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is it always . . . . ' ' she could n ' t find the words to describe what had just happened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' he replied harshly . [SEP]
[CLS] just thinking about her response had him growing hard again . [SEP]
[CLS] her head came up and he rolled back over . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t like this normally , ' ' he gr ##ated out . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , the w ##hir ##l ##wind started again . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , it was more intense , and victoria pushed her head back and forth against the sheets , the pleasure almost reaching the painful stage before she tumbled over the edge , once again crying out and holding onto dh ##ar ##r as the waves of her orgasm crashed over the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria slept , unable to do anything else since her body was so rep ##lete . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s love making was so thorough and complete , she had nothing left in her afterwards . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r watched her , noting the dark circles under her eyes and the perfect rose ting ##e to her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] she curled up against him , laying her head on his shoulder while her hands wrapped around his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if she felt in sleep what he was currently feeling wide awake . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t want to lose her . [SEP]
[CLS] with complete honesty , he knew that this was the reason he ' d come to her for help with his niece and nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] there were probably hundreds of childhood experts he could have employed but he ' d gone back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never gotten her out of his mind after all these years . [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' d wanted to finish what he ' d started with her , even if it meant he would n ' t be her first . [SEP]
[CLS] after five years , he had acknowledged that he had n ' t cared . [SEP]
[CLS] but now , seeing the evidence of her virginity on the sheets , he ' d obviously made a huge mistake five years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been pure and honest with him and he ' d tried to destroy her . [SEP]
[CLS] he remembered the confused and hurt look in her face when he ' d stood up , call ##ously straightening his tie as if he was completely imp ##art ##ial to what had just happened . [SEP]
[CLS] walking out of her bedroom that morning had been one of the hardest things he ' d ever had to do in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] and now , seeing her beautiful face relaxed in sleep , a sleep caused by her first experience with sex , he regretted it even more . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r waited until he was sure she was asleep before slipping out of the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he left her sleeping , unable to endure the incredible pleasure of her sweet , warm body curled up next to his . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted desperately to kiss her awake , to make love to her once again . [SEP]
[CLS] but he knew he needed to think , to come up with a plan to make it up to her for what he ' d done to her before . [SEP]
[CLS] he also needed to put into motion what he ' d started before . [SEP]
[CLS] he would never let her go again , he promised . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d show her all that he could offer her and somehow , he vowed , he ' d find a way to keep her in his life forever . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 10 victoria woke the following morning to bright sunlight streaming over her face . [SEP]
[CLS] she stretched lang ##uo ##rous ##ly , feeling happy and content . [SEP]
[CLS] del ##iri ##ous , in fact , she thought as she rolled onto her back and stared up at the ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] then the memories of the night before came streaming back to her and victoria ' s face started burning . [SEP]
[CLS] looking around , she searched for dh ##ar ##r , wondering what he was thinking about her behavior from the night before . [SEP]
[CLS] would he think she was want ##on ? [SEP]
[CLS] he must , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] since she had been , there was really nothing else the man could think of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was embarrassed but knew she ' d have to get the first morning contact with him over quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] but all she found was a long , slim jewelry case where he should have been . [SEP]
[CLS] with shaking fingers , victoria pulled the case closer to her , feeling a cold chill steal into her veins . [SEP]
[CLS] what could this mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] why in the world would he leave in the middle of the night ? [SEP]
[CLS] even the case was a work of art , she thought , running her fingers over the soft , em ##bos ##sed leather . [SEP]
[CLS] opening the box , she gasped , seeing the spectacular glittering diamond bracelet inside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how could he ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said to the empty room , slapping the box closed and tossing it to the side as if it were some sort of serpent . [SEP]
[CLS] the tears formed and immediately fell down her cheeks as his message came through . [SEP]
[CLS] well , she ' d been wondering what he thought of her and now she knew . [SEP]
[CLS] payment for services rendered , she thought , shaking her head in denial . [SEP]
[CLS] last night had been so incredible , so passionate and she ' d allowed it ! [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' d left her , just as he would an alley prostitute , leaving payment on the bedside . [SEP]
[CLS] oh ! [SEP]
[CLS] of all the arrogant , offensive evil things he could have done , this was the ultimate slap in the face . [SEP]
[CLS] at least the last time he ' d touched her he ' d had the dignity to insult her to her face . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t even given her that much this time . [SEP]
[CLS] she was obviously un ##worthy of his time now . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , how she ' d lost herself in the moment last night and now , to find this awful message from him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was worse than the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] five years ago , he ' d said she was un ##worthy but she had n ' t understood his meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] now , he leaves this awful bracelet that was probably worth a fortune but the message was loud and clear . [SEP]
[CLS] she jumped out of the bed and showered as quickly as possible , wishing she could just leave and run away . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed to lick her wounds and hide for a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] she would just pack up and leave . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d done it to her the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] why should n ' t she give him the same response ? [SEP]
[CLS] if he thought so little of her , then she could give him the same courtesy back . [SEP]
[CLS] what a fool she ' d been ! [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d just fallen into his arms , letting him touch her and kiss her . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt filthy and as the hot water cascade ##d over her aching body , she scrubbed her arms and body , trying to rid herself of the memory of his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated him ! [SEP]
[CLS] she cried through the whole shower , scrub ##bing herself harder when the memory of how it felt when he ' d touched her would n ' t go away . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling out her suitcase , she started throwing things in , not even bothering to fold them . [SEP]
[CLS] jeans and tee shirts were piled up , underwear and socks came next and she just lifted them out of her drawer and stuffed them into the suitcase as fast as her arms would permit . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have to be subjected to that kind of humiliation again . [SEP]
[CLS] it was too much . [SEP]
[CLS] but then ari ##na and baja ##n came to mind . [SEP]
[CLS] what would happen to all the progress she ' d made with them if yet another person disappeared on them ? [SEP]
[CLS] they would be devastated . [SEP]
[CLS] until she could transfer their feelings from her to dh ##ar ##r , then she just could n ' t leave them . [SEP]
[CLS] that realization was devastating to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she sat down on the bed , her shoulders shaking as the pain see ##ped into her body once again . [SEP]
[CLS] she even hated to admit that her feelings for dh ##ar ##r were n ' t hatred , but were love . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved him desperately . [SEP]
[CLS] and this time , it was a mature love . [SEP]
[CLS] she admired him for what he ' d done with his country and how he treated two , small , orphaned children . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the way he made her laugh , even when she wanted to be angry with him . [SEP]
[CLS] but this time , she did n ' t have scott or jasmine to help her out . [SEP]
[CLS] she was on her own . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow , she ' d have to find the strength inside herself to keep him from crushing her again . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling on a pair of jeans and a regular white tee - shirt , she grabbed the hated box and left her suite . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even care that she did n ' t have makeup on . [SEP]
[CLS] she was too angry and too determined to show him that she did n ' t care what his opinion of her was . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped the first servant she could find and asked about dh ##ar ##r ' s whereabouts . [SEP]
[CLS] if she were n ' t so angry , she would be amused by the expressions on each palace servant ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] it was as if dh ##ar ##r ' s location were a closely guarded secret and only the people who already had appointments were permitted to know where and when he would see them . [SEP]
[CLS] und ##eter ##red , victoria assumed that he would most likely be in his office at this time of the morning , although she was n ' t exactly sure what time it was since she ' d forgotten to put on her watch . [SEP]
[CLS] her tennis shoes were basically silent as she walked along the corridors to his office . [SEP]
[CLS] she stormed in and stood in front of his personal secretary . [SEP]
[CLS] this man was n ' t the usual one that sat outside , guarding dh ##ar ##r ' s office from intruder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea where the other man was and did n ' t care right at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she only had one mission in mind and anyone who stood in her way was going to regret it , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to speak with dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she said , her voice quivering with her anger and humiliation at the hands of the same man twice in her lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] the man simply stared at victoria , dumb ##founded for a long moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his highness is unavailable at the moment but i ' ll be happy to make an appointment with you at his earliest convenience . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and hated the fact that tears started to form in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` find him now and tell him i want to speak with him immediately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t do that , madam , ' ' the man said stiffly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it simply is n ' t done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wiped the tears from her eyes angrily and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it is done today . [SEP]
[CLS] call him ! [SEP]
[CLS] if you do n ' t , i ' ll just walk right into his office , guards or no guards . [SEP]
[CLS] and then they ' ll get in trouble for touching me , it will be a huge mess . [SEP]
[CLS] so why do n ' t you just tell him i ' m out here waiting and we can avoid an ugly confrontation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] something about the way she was holding herself or perhaps her words sunk in to the man and he responded . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly picked up the phone and said something in arabic . [SEP]
[CLS] it sounded very apologetic but a moment later , he put the phone down and nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his highness will see you now , ' ' the man said , standing up and bowing politely . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria already knew where his office was , having gone there every day to report her progress with the children . [SEP]
[CLS] so she walked quickly down the hallway and shoved open the doors . [SEP]
[CLS] she found him , standing behind his desk , arms crossed over his chest and two other men sc ##ur ##ry ##ing out of his office , closing the doors behind them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this wo n ' t take long , ' ' she said and slapped the box into the middle of his enormous desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you ever do that to me again ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , and wiped another tear down her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am not something you can . . . . ' ' she struggled to get past the words . . . . ' ' that you can just purchase , like some . . . . ' ' she stopped , tried to gain her composure and failed . [SEP]
[CLS] she covered her face in her hands and sobbed , her shoulders shaking with her humiliation . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt him touch her shoulders , she snapped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t touch me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and backed away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hate you for that , ' ' she said , pointing to the box on his desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not a w ##h . . . . ' ' ` ` stop it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he snapped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t ever say that again , ' ' he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t speak to me like that ! [SEP]
[CLS] i hate you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered , wishing she could yell at him , punch him , hurt him the same way he ' d hurt her . [SEP]
[CLS] but he seemed imp ##er ##vious to anything she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just leave me alone , ' ' she said and ran down the hallway , leaving the doors open in her wake . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t care that she left horrified palace staff members gaping at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was probably the only person who had ever spoken to the king of ash ##ir in that manner but she did n ' t care what they did to her . [SEP]
[CLS] if they shipped her off , then at least she ' d be rid of that horrible man and the future of the children would n ' t be on her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] thinking of ari ##na and baja ##n , she hurried to find them , wanting to be with them and find some sol ##ace in their innocence and goodness . [SEP]
[CLS] she found them in the play ##room , giggling and pretending with dolls and dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she entered , they both stood up , then smiled broadly when they realized it was her and not another servant . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , victoria , ' ' ari ##na exclaimed , running into victoria ' s arms , hugging her tightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are we going to do today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked excitedly . [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n was more ci ##rc ##ums ##pe ##ct with his enthusiasm but he followed , his eyes showing victoria that he was just as excited about the day as his sister . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria considered her options . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to get outside , fearing that dh ##ar ##r would locate her if she stayed in the palace . [SEP]
[CLS] but why would he bother ? [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t the bracelet say everything he needed to say ? [SEP]
[CLS] pushing back her depression , she bent down and sat cross legged on the floor , hugging baja ##n who leaned against her , still not able to hug someone himself , as if he considered it a weakness , but needing the physical contact regardless . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about if we go out and you can both introduce me to your horses ? [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t you mention that they ' d been neglected recently ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] both jumped up and were thrilled with the idea . [SEP]
[CLS] they took her hands and led her out of the play room . [SEP]
[CLS] they walked through so many hallways , victoria was completely lost by the time they entered the bright sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] visiting the stables was the perfect idea , she thought as they both led her toward their favorite animals . [SEP]
[CLS] after being introduced to the horses , then feeding them , brushing them and basically learning more about the animals than victoria ever wanted to know , they discovered a small stall that had no horses in it , but something just as exciting . [SEP]
[CLS] a litter of kitten ##s had been born about two weeks earlier and were playing in the hay . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria and the children huddled around them , enjoying the small creatures and pet ##ting their soft fur . [SEP]
[CLS] they spent the rest of the morning just playing with the kitten ##s and finding food for them , not leaving until all six of them settled down and fell asleep on top of one another . [SEP]
[CLS] the three of them tr ##otted happily back to the palace and victoria decided to take the children to the kitchens for lunch . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no need for a servant to bring them something when they could just as easily , and more happily , make something for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] the chef was horrified that the prince and princess of ash ##ir would enter his kitchens . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was equally shocked to think of her two small charges in that way . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d only thought of them as a small girl and boy , but she realized that they really were royalty since they were the children of dh ##ar ##r ' s brother , who was also a prince . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the second time in her life she ' d treated someone as just another person , un ##car ##ing of their position within the world . [SEP]
[CLS] but this time , she was n ' t going to listen to some ridiculous chef sp ##out ##ing si ##llin ##ess about how it was beneath them to step into the kitchen , much less make their own meal . [SEP]
[CLS] being fed up with arrogance and po ##mp ##ous attitudes , victoria simply demanded peanut butter and jelly so they could make a sandwich . [SEP]
[CLS] when she took that attitude , the items were quickly delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria , ari ##na and baja ##n made such a mess out of a simple sandwich process , they giggled and made a bigger mess . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the sandwiches were finished , each of them had jelly in their hair and peanut butter on their noses and cheeks , not to mention all over their fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria cleaned up the mess , then they took their sandwiches to the portrait studio . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria decided to let the children talk about their ancestors and see how their parents fit into the whole history of ash ##ir . [SEP]
[CLS] the children were extremely knowledge ##able about their history and they sat down underneath their father ' s picture to eat . [SEP]
[CLS] they were silent and stared up at him , mu ##nch ##ing their sandwiches and sipping milk . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria led them back to the play ##room where a new teacher had arrived and was excited to meet her new charges . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , the children were afraid to be left alone with the teacher so victoria stayed with them , simply sitting in the back of the classroom . [SEP]
[CLS] but when the woman , named ms . ki ##ri , asked them to come with them to the front of the room and sit down on some pillows to read stories , play with puppets , victoria soon found herself super ##fl ##uous . [SEP]
[CLS] she was also impressed with the teacher and wanted to make herself scarce so the teacher would n ' t feel pressure by being observed . [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped out of the school room , only to bump into the one person she had been trying to avoid all day long . [SEP]
[CLS] without saying a word , dh ##ar ##r grabbed her wrist and walked into the school room . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes snapped to the empty desk ##s and turned to face her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are they ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded in a low , angry voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are who ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria asked , trying to yank her arm free but her efforts only caused her more pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the children ! [SEP]
[CLS] what have you done with them ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you accusing me of now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , stopping her efforts and standing up to him , as much as she could with him towering over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the children are sitting up there with their new teacher , entrance ##d by her story and having a wonderful time . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s surprise showed on his face and he yanked her forward . [SEP]
[CLS] when he saw the children , completely und ##ist ##urbed by their argument , he pulled her along behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] once they were out in the hallway , he turned her so she was facing him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where have you been all day ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was still hurt and furious about the night before and she was n ' t about to take this from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been out shopping and spending all of ash ##ir ' s money . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope you do n ' t mind , ' ' she continued sarcastically . [SEP]
[CLS] then the anger rushed back and she could n ' t stop herself from asking , ` ` where do you think i ' ve been ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her closer , turning her so she was fully facing him now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t play , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] you were supposed to have gone down to the stables but when i went there to find you , no one knew where you were . [SEP]
[CLS] you did n ' t bring the children for lunch in the dining room and were gone for over an hour since the last servant saw either hide nor hair of you . [SEP]
[CLS] so i ' ll ask again , where in the hell have you been ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria remembered how much she hated him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hate to di ##sil ##lusion you about how awful a person i am yet again , your highness , ' ' she said with a s ##neer , ` ` but your palace spies really are n ' t very good at their job . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d recommend either a ref ##resh ##er course or a whole new entourage of spies if these ca n ' t do the job . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was about to shut her mouth but the furious look in his eyes and the muscle twitching on his jaw told her she might have gone too far . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we went to the stables and played with the kitten ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you probably did n ' t see us because you ' re nose is too high in the air or maybe because you ' re mind is relentless ##ly in the gut ##ter . [SEP]
[CLS] and then , ' ' she went on when she saw that he was going to say something , ` ` we went to the kitchen and made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ourselves . [SEP]
[CLS] after that , we went to the portrait gallery and looked at the picture of your brother . [SEP]
[CLS] the kids were silent but would n ' t take their eyes off of him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ended with a lowered tone and the shock inside dh ##ar ##r loosened his hold so she was able to pull free easily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what awful things were you thinking of this time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , rubbing her wrists and glaring up at his surprised , black eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he shoved his hands into his pockets , his shoulders losing some of his anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you ' d left me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r ' s words snapped her eyes back to his but she could n ' t see what was going on inside his head . [SEP]
[CLS] did his comment mean he would have been disappointed if she ' d left ? [SEP]
[CLS] no ! [SEP]
[CLS] she had gotten her hopes up that he might feel something sincere for her twice and both times , she ' d been burned , badly . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t go down that path again . [SEP]
[CLS] it hurt too much when her hopes were dashed cruel ##ly under his un ##fe ##elin ##g manners . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t leave until the children transfer their trust to you , ' ' she said and walked away . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria headed back to her room and noticed that her clothes were all put away as was her suitcase . [SEP]
[CLS] her bed was made as well and all evidence of the previous night was gone . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria sat down on her bed and put her head in her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r did n ' t trust her . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to avoid him at all costs and still get out of here with her heart and her pride intact . [SEP]
[CLS] but how was she going to do that ? [SEP]
[CLS] sighing , she knew the answer . [SEP]
[CLS] avoid him at all costs . [SEP]
[CLS] moving out of her suite , she wandered the halls , asking a servant to convey the message that she would be absent for dinner tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] the servant asked if a meal should be brought to her suite but she shook her head , smiling and thanking her but moving off in a direction of the palace she ' d never seen before . [SEP]
[CLS] an hour later , victoria found a wonderful area . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a music room . [SEP]
[CLS] or more appropriately , a dance room . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a seventies style dance floor complete with lights under a clear pl ##ex ##ig ##las floor , a disco ball and a huge variety of songs . [SEP]
[CLS] she fiddle ##d with the stereo system and was impressed when the sound came from several different speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] the lights came on with another flick of some buttons and suddenly , victoria was standing in the middle of a dance floor with soft jazz coming through speakers from all different sides of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] stepping into the middle , she closed her eyes and swayed to the beat , letting all her tension from the previous night and all the hurt from this morning melt away . [SEP]
[CLS] each time a thought of dh ##ar ##r came into her mind , she pushed it away and forced her mind to think about something else . [SEP]
[CLS] but the very effort to push his thoughts away kept them coming . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , she knew she could no longer ignore the way he ' d made her feel last night . [SEP]
[CLS] if only the morning had n ' t come so soon . [SEP]
[CLS] if only she could have slept in his arms and woken up to feel his body under her head , to hear his heartbeat in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that was the way she ' d fallen asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] what had gone wrong ? [SEP]
[CLS] she shuddered at the memory of his kiss , of his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] despite her anger , her body wanted to feel him again , right now . [SEP]
[CLS] she swung around and continued dancing , hoping she could hide in this room forever . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least until late at night when she could sneak back to her room . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t dare go back to her own room . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was furious enough with her to seek her out . [SEP]
[CLS] and what insults would he throw her way this time ? [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to find out . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed to protect her heart and her pride . [SEP]
[CLS] and she needed to find a way to fall out of love with the man . [SEP]
[CLS] she was swaying and singing , feeling the beat through her bones as the bass thumped out the beat . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were closed but she could see the lights from the ceiling through her eyelids and she just g ##lor ##ied in the feel of the music and being alone . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly , she felt strong arms en ##ci ##rcle her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] she tensed instantly , even though she knew it was n ' t a stranger . [SEP]
[CLS] it was dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d know his scent anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] his arms were tender as they reached around , his head bending down to kiss her neck , her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria wanted to pull away but his mouth made her knees give out and she found herself leaning against him , her back touching his chest , her head falling back to lay against his hard shoulder , giving him greater access to her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dh ##ar ##r , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing in here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his voice husky as his hands slipped along her stomach , resting just under her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hiding from you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shivered when his hands moved slightly , her breasts already aching to feel his hands caress them . [SEP]
[CLS] she could feel them swelling , her nipples harden ##ing in anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you hiding from me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his hand moving higher and he heard her sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound filled his senses and cooled his ri ##led temper . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been searching for her for over an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] when he ' d heard the music coming from this area of the palace , he felt the tension drain away , to be replaced by the sexual need he felt whenever he was close to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i did n ' t want you to hurt me anymore , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] but her body could n ' t move away from his . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r heard the words and closed his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t realize i ' d hurt you so much last night . [SEP]
[CLS] it was never my intention . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria found the strength and swung around . [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t let her move away but at least she was facing him now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did n ' t hurt me last night , ' ' she said and felt the tears and anger well up inside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you hurt me this morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r saw the pain and moved his hand up from her waist to her cheek , cr ##ad ##ling her face with his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he said a moment before his mouth touched hers . [SEP]
[CLS] he felt her shudder and knew that it was n ' t because of his kiss this time . [SEP]
[CLS] and he wrapped his arms around her , holding her close as he kissed her to ease her pain , trying to eliminate the hurt he ' d caused her by his confused reaction to their night together . [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her resistance move away , he showed her in the only way he knew how that he was sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted her up and carried her back to his suite , ignoring the music and lights that were still on in the music room . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t stop until he shouldered the door to his bedroom closed behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] then he let her legs slip down his body but would n ' t allow her to move away . [SEP]
[CLS] he stripped off her clothes right there , worship ##ing her body and kissing her everywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] his mouth moved to her breasts , capturing the peak in his mouth , pulling , nu ##zzling , sucking until she cried out , then he moved to the other , applying the same attention and hearing her surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] he could smell her arousal and it excited him as nothing else ever had . [SEP]
[CLS] reaching down , his hand covered her , moving inside , encouraging her to open for him . [SEP]
[CLS] his moth moved lower , kissing her stomach before he knee ##led in front of her , his tongue moving to cover where his hand had been . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like am ##bro ##sia when he felt her tighten , then her first release was upon her and she melted down , shaking in his arms as he carried her to his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] she opened her eyes and saw that he was still dressed and her eyes widened in shock . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t , ' ' he said , thinking of the time five years ago when he ' d brought her to her first climax and then left her . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly pulled off his clothes , then came down beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you now , ' ' he said , and moved between her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] he was thrilled when she opened for him again , welcoming him with her legs , her arms and her body as his slid into hers . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r closed his eyes , the ecstasy of his entry almost too much for him to control . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so tight , so slick and hot he wanted to come inside her immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] but he held back , gaining control of his ramp ##aging desires so he could help her find her release once more . [SEP]
[CLS] within moments , she was crying out , dh ##ar ##r felt her shivers start and that brought him over the edge as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he bent down and took her cries in his mouth , kissing her as they crashed together . [SEP]
[CLS] as their breathing came back to normal , dh ##ar ##r pulled her close , holding her against his shoulder as his hands tangled in her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , wondering what she was thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d stilled a moment ago and he was worried about what she was thinking about . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she felt dh ##ar ##r ' s chest rumble as he laughed at her response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] then he turned serious . [SEP]
[CLS] rolling her back , he looked down into her troubled green eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry about this morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r rolled his eyes at her polite response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria , if you do n ' t stop being so polite , i ' m going to make love to you just to make sure you ' re the woman i was holding in my arms a few minutes ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria blushed but looked away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what would you like me to say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she was terrified of what he was going to say or do next . [SEP]
[CLS] the past two sexual encounters with him had left her wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure she could survive another blow from him . [SEP]
[CLS] not right now anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe once she ' d recovered from the tender care he ' d just shown her , she would be able to handle it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just need a little time to find my balance , ' ' she finally said , knowing that he was waiting for her to say something else . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t really leave much room for anything , do you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i try not to . [SEP]
[CLS] would you have it any other way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria inhaled sharply as his hand moved from her waist to her thigh , then back up again . [SEP]
[CLS] she wiggled in his arms and blushed when he chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and pushed against his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew it was a useless endeavor unless he permitted it . [SEP]
[CLS] but since he did , she rolled him onto his back , her hair cas ##ca ##ding around his face as she looked down at him this time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not going to do that to me again , ' ' she said , smiling in excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , yes , victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to do it again and again , ' ' he countered and since his hands were no longer needed to hold his weight off her , they were free to ski ##m across her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love the way your body responds to my touch , ' ' he growled , running his hands over her shoulders and arms , then back down her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does yours ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' he responded but he smiled at the interest in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her tongue touching his skin , tasting the salt and enjoying his ind ##ra ##wn breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think it is my turn , ' ' she said and bent to touch her mouth to his male nipple , loving the way his hands held her still . [SEP]
[CLS] but she had too much exploring to do and her head moved around . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands felt his muscles , touching him while her mouth continued its exploration . [SEP]
[CLS] as her mouth moved lower , she could feel his body tense . [SEP]
[CLS] feeling powerful and feminine , she moved lower , her mouth hovering over his man ##hood for a long moment before finally closing over him . [SEP]
[CLS] the harsh intake of breath she heard from him excited her and she continued , tentatively exploring and tasting , loving the velvet hardness of him . [SEP]
[CLS] long before she was satisfied , he pulled her up , bringing her mouth to his and kissing her while his hands settled her over him , having her st ##rad ##dle his hips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you want power ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could only nod her head , feeling head ##y and so turned on she could barely think much less talk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then take control , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] with a hand on each side of her hips , he slid inside her , watching her face as the surprise filtered in . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria moved her hips , then gasped in delight as feelings of intense pleasure sea ##red through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do i do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , moving again and loving the way it felt . [SEP]
[CLS] she continued to move in ways that caused pleasure , closing her eyes and letting the feelings course through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything , ' ' he rasped , lifting his hands to touch her breasts , then tangle in her hair , pulling her down to kiss her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything you want , ' ' he said again . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria needed no further encouragement . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved , letting him slide in and out , enjoying the expression on his face as she did so . [SEP]
[CLS] after several minutes , he took her hips and controlled the pace , and within minutes , she was shivering , collapsing on top of his chest as her third orgasm ripped through her , leaving her helpless and lang ##uo ##rous . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea that he ' d also found his release , just knowing that her body could n ' t move any more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` victoria ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , lifting her hair up so he could see her face . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria just put her hand over his mouth , moving her head so she could see him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t speak , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] turning away so he could n ' t see her tears , she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because each time we get to this point , you say something or do something nasty and then i ' ll have to hate you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r was absolutely still for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and if i do n ' t say or do something nasty ? [SEP]
[CLS] how will you feel about me then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria started shivering . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the moment of truth and she was n ' t sure if she was up to it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m still waiting to start hating you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r laughed softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would it help if you knew that i do n ' t want to make you hate me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling her hair off to one side , he let his fingers feel the softness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in fact , i do n ' t think i ' ve been able to actually live without you for the past five years , ' ' he admitted . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria could feel his heart beat accelerate and turned to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you leave me like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , wishing she could stop the hurt in her voice but it was still too raw , especially after last night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you say those things to me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r sighed and sat up , pulling her with him but not letting her move away . [SEP]
[CLS] he tucked the pillows behind his back and looked down at her lovely , pain filled eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i was jealous . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jealous ? [SEP]
[CLS] of what ? [SEP]
[CLS] or who ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of scott . [SEP]
[CLS] that morning , i arrived in london early . [SEP]
[CLS] i came to see you and found scott leaving your dorm room , happily enjoying a sandwich and looking like he ' d just fallen out of bed . [SEP]
[CLS] i naturally assumed it had been yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s mouth dropped open and she looked up into his face . [SEP]
[CLS] the laughter started slowly but the more she thought about it , the harder she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r obviously did n ' t appreciate the humor but he did n ' t pull away . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , he only waited until her laughter died away before raising one eyebrow in inquiry . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you care to share the joke ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria nodded and smiled again , controlling the laughter , but just barely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` scott ' s gay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she watched the emotions cross his face , running the ga ##mut of disbelief to shock to horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked in a strangled voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gay , ' ' she confirmed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in fact , at the time , he was dating a very nice man named marcus . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r leaned his head back against the silk covered head ##board and closed his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he said , pulling her closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so sorry , ' ' he said again and buried his face in her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria felt all the awful feelings just melt away and she wrapped her arms around his neck , feeling her heart melt with his apology . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but why did you . . . . ' ' she swallowed hard before she could continue , ` ` leave that nasty message this morning ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i swear it was n ' t what you were thinking , ' ' he said , lifting his head and she could see the sincerity in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was a gift to show you how much last night meant to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i swear it was nothing more than that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , dh ##ar ##r ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry , ' ' she said and pulled him close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i knew i lo . . . ' ' she stopped just in time . [SEP]
[CLS] just because he did n ' t think nasty , dem ##ean ##ing things , did n ' t mean he wanted her love . [SEP]
[CLS] the words were swallowed quickly and she looked up , trying to decide if she ' d goo ##fed again . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes sharpened on her shocked face and he moved closer , determined to find out what she had been about to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what were you going to say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that you love me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria was going to deny it but she could tell that the dictator had come back . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t going to get around it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she said sadly , looking up at the ceiling instead of his handsome face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i know you do n ' t want that right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she started to get out of bed , feeling foolish but he pulled her back , swinging her so she was laying flat against the now rum ##pled sheets , her hair flying out behind her and dh ##ar ##r towering over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` say it , ' ' he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why , so you can laugh at me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she threw back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes softened and he shook his head gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] so i can tell you how much i love you . [SEP]
[CLS] how much i need you in my life and how i have suffered for five long years , thinking you were falling in love and marrying another man because i was too stupid to claim you for my own . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with each word , the pain surrounding victoria ' s heart melted a little more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you love me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her hands coming to touch his handsome face and her eyes filling up with hope . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] now will you say it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out , throwing herself into his arms and bringing his face down to hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , you arrogant man , ' ' she giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re going to marry me and give me lots of children and help me raise ari ##na and baja ##n , ' ' he ordered , bending down to kiss her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' she agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue dh ##ar ##r closed the file and nodded in the general direction of the men gathered around the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for your input , gentlemen , ' ' he said , effectively ending the meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r stood up and walked out . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as he passed by his secretary ' s desk , he raised an eyebrow in question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in the kitchen your highness , ' ' the man said , bowing and closing his eyes although he wished he could look up and see the king ' s expression . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost comical to see his face when he realized his queen was doing something he di ##sa ##pp ##roved of . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##ar ##r sighed heavily and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked down the now familiar hallway , reaching the kitchen in short time . [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped in the doorway , watching the scene in front of him . [SEP]
[CLS] the chefs were off to one side , bus ##ily preparing food for the evening meal . [SEP]
[CLS] but in one corner , in an area specially created for small beings to cook with low tables and smaller measuring cups , tiny refrigerator ##s and safety blend ##ers , sat his brother ' s children as well as his two year old son . [SEP]
[CLS] the three of them were staring into a bowl surrounded by a table covered in flour and something he suspected was chocolate but he could never be sure . [SEP]
[CLS] then his eyes moved higher to watch his beautiful , hugely pregnant wife wa ##ddle out of the store ##room . [SEP]
[CLS] she was due to deliver their daughter any day now but still she somehow got her body down to the level of the small table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here you go , ' ' she was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria handed the milk to baja ##n since it was obviously his turn to put the ingredient into the bowl . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` daddy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his son david said and got up out of his chair to throw himself into his father ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] baja ##n was next and then ari ##na who pushed her body between the more aggressive boys to reach dh ##ar ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] he hugged all of them , then let them lead him over to their cooking table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you making today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re learning about fraction ##s , ' ' baja ##n said importantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , fraction ##s , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said and dipped his finger into the cookie dough . [SEP]
[CLS] it was pretty good . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wish i could have learned about fraction ##s like this , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re deprived , ' ' victoria said , rolling her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , i ' m in love , ' ' he replied and pulled her into his arms effortlessly , despite her extra pounds . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so am i , ' ' she replied , willingly moving into his arms and kissing him back . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 1 ` ` no , jacob , you ca n ' t eat sam ' s fruit . [SEP]
[CLS] it does n ' t count even if you are twins . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at her watch , sir ##i michaels realized they were again running behind on their morning schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] as she put the milk back in the refrigerator , she caught a suspicious movement out of the corner of her eye . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , you ca n ' t hide your fruit in your pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] you did that last week and forgot about them . [SEP]
[CLS] i found them when i was doing the laundry and it was disgusting . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she almost rolled her eyes when her twin three year old boys laughed delighted ##ly at rotting fruit in their jeans pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] were all boys fascinated by anything disgusting ? [SEP]
[CLS] or were hers just abnormal ##ly en ##th ##ral ##led ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on guys . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to hurry up . [SEP]
[CLS] just finish your milk and go ##bble up those apples . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shoved the files she ' d been working on the previous night into her computer bag and looked around , stepping over lego ##s and narrowly missing a toy fire truck . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she was still in her slip ##pers because if she ' d changed into her heels for the work day , she ' d have been a go ##nne ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in the midst of making a path , she remembered one very important question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , did you put on underwear today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] why she even had to ask was beyond her but the ti ##ke liked going as free as a bird . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t looking at him but since there was no response , she glanced back and found two dark , curly heads bent close . [SEP]
[CLS] as much as she loved these little guys , that pose was never good . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' d learned the hard way that silence was bad . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , very bad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , ' ' she called out from three feet away and waited until she had his full attention . [SEP]
[CLS] when he looked up , the guilt in his eyes told her she ' d caught them doing something wrong , but the trick was figuring out what that ` ` something ' ' might be . [SEP]
[CLS] had it already occurred ? [SEP]
[CLS] or was their mischief imminent ? [SEP]
[CLS] she had to maintain a straight face under these circumstances , otherwise , they would consider her humor as encouragement in whatever they had planned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , do you have underwear on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked again . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help it when the chuckle escaped as he looked down and pulled his pants away to check . [SEP]
[CLS] how could he not know ? [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed to her like underwear was an essential piece of clothing and the absence of that piece would be bother ##some and uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i knew the answer to her question when he looked up with that devil ##ish grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go put some on , ' ' she commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] the little guy scrambled off his chair before racing full speed to the bedroom and sir ##i was grateful that he was still at an age when he would obey her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t take a break to ponder the future at this point in the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] with sam out of the picture , that left jacob alone . [SEP]
[CLS] together , the twins were as thick as thieves . [SEP]
[CLS] separate them though , and she could usually get one to confess . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you guys planning ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , bending down so she was at eye level with jacob . [SEP]
[CLS] they were fra ##tern ##al twins , but they looked so similar it was extremely difficult for strangers to tell them apart . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i could because she knew them and loved every tiny fr ##eck ##le on their faces . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not planning anything , ' ' jacob whispered , and he placed a chu ##bby hand on both sides of her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise , momma . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re innocent . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i knew she was in trouble then . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob , if you let me in on the secret , maybe we can have ice cream for dessert tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob ' s eyes widened and he smiled excitedly , showing his tiny white todd ##ler teeth with gaps in between because not all of his teeth were in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` momma , sam has a surprise for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i ' s stomach chu ##rned with those words . [SEP]
[CLS] the last time sam brought her a surprise , he was covered in mud and had two little kitten ##s under each arm . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d ` ` rescued ' ' the kitten ##s from someone else ' s backyard . [SEP]
[CLS] how he ' d done that , she had no idea since her back yard was fence ##d in with a gate that only an adult could handle and there were n ' t any kitten ##s , much less mud , in her backyard . [SEP]
[CLS] it had taken a week and several lost kitten posters posted around the neighborhood before the original owners had been found and kitten ##s returned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob , you know i love surprises , ' ' she lied and felt no remorse , ` ` but i also know that sometimes sam ' s surprises can be a bit scary . [SEP]
[CLS] can you give me a hint ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob was torn because he did n ' t want his mother to be scared , but he could n ' t reveal the amazing surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this wo n ' t scare you . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a good surprise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam was coming back down the hallway by that point so there was n ' t anything else sir ##i could say to convince him at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] but she ' d have to work on him a bit later , her stomach churning at the idea of whatever these two extremely intelligent children had devised . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , do n ' t tell him i know there ' s going to be a surprise , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it would make it easier to work on jacob if sam did n ' t reinforce the ` ` surprise ' ' aspect of the treat they were creating for her . [SEP]
[CLS] at least she hoped it was for her . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of her boys devi ##sing something for someone else , where she was n ' t able to run interference , was n ' t a scenario she re ##lish ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob nodded happily , then jumped down off his chair himself and caught up with his brother . [SEP]
[CLS] she cringed when she saw their heads immediately bend towards each other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get your shoes and coats on , ' ' she called out and looked at the news on her computer screen , surveying the headlines on the chicago tribune website . [SEP]
[CLS] elections coming , check . [SEP]
[CLS] jobs report getting better , check . [SEP]
[CLS] weather , rainy . [SEP]
[CLS] not check , not good . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] put on your rain coats , ' ' she called out again . [SEP]
[CLS] oil prices down , for how long ? [SEP]
[CLS] she started to put her computer to sleep , but something caught her eye . [SEP]
[CLS] oil prices down because . . . . no ! [SEP]
[CLS] that simply was n ' t possible ! [SEP]
[CLS] in her panic , she could n ' t even ensure that the boys were following her instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes skimmed the text , then re - read the first paragraph over again since her panic was dim ##ini ##shing her ability to absorb what the words were explaining . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s di ##vor ##cing ? [SEP]
[CLS] she sat down heavily in the kitchen chair and clicked on the screen to get the full article . [SEP]
[CLS] as she read through the words , only the message that she ##ik malik bin sa ##q ##qa ##f was in the midst of a divorce and pressure was mounting for him to re - marry quickly in order to produce an heir , something that had n ' t happened in his first marriage and his advisors were becoming worried about an end to the dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] a dynasty that had been extremely good for dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] why was a divorce necessary ? [SEP]
[CLS] why was n ' t he just marrying another woman , she wondered ? [SEP]
[CLS] could n ' t he have several wives ? [SEP]
[CLS] the idea actually made her stomach ache so she slapped the computer shut and turned around , only to find several sets of eyes staring at her . [SEP]
[CLS] sam and jacob were in their rain coats and shoes , although sam had his shoes on the wrong feet . [SEP]
[CLS] to the left of sam were their two dogs , ` ` rover ' ' and ` ` boy ' ' , neither canine having a very celebrated parent ##age and to the right of jacob was ` ` kitty ' ' , a white , short haired fe ##line that loved shed ##ding on sir ##i ' s black slacks . [SEP]
[CLS] all three animals had not been her choice but had shown up at various stages in her sons ' short lives and become part of the family . [SEP]
[CLS] sam was the animal lover and any creature that crossed his path needed to be adopted and ` ` loved ' ' by her adorable little son . [SEP]
[CLS] he brought home animals even when they had owners , and she had to return them , sometimes with a very sad boy on her hands because , in his mind , no one could take care of animals and give them enough love like he could . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong , momma ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked , his hand holding rover ' s sc ##rag ##gly fur nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob , sensing the same tension , leaned into sam and both boys somehow figured out how to have as much of their bodies touching each other without lying on top of the other . [SEP]
[CLS] they did n ' t need to be concerned with her trauma , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] all they needed in their lives right now was a secure home with lots of hugs , kisses , understanding and parameters . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing is wrong , little guys , ' ' she said and paste ##d a bright smile on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just remembered that i needed to stop and get gas but i can do that after i drop you two off at school . [SEP]
[CLS] i know you have your big day today , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the boys relaxed slightly , but they kept close , not sure if they believed their mother or not . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go , ' ' she said and herd ##ed the boys out to the car , kept the animals in the house with one foot while she closed and locked the door , all the while balancing their school bags on one shoulder , her computer bag in the other , her keys in her right hand and her coffee in the left . [SEP]
[CLS] she refused to let her mind think about that man and his divorce as well as all the painful memories that were long gone and should never to be thought of again . [SEP]
[CLS] as she drove them the short distance to their preschool , she did her best to appear upbeat and un ##con ##cer ##ned until she kissed each of them on their chu ##bby cheeks moments before they each ran off to play with their friends . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched them carefully for a few moments , noting that each other was their real best friend . [SEP]
[CLS] the others in the play group were interesting , but sam and jacob were two halves of a whole . [SEP]
[CLS] when they were in elementary school , she ' d have to separate them , encourage them to open up to others and divers ##ify their lives , but for now , they were doing well . [SEP]
[CLS] they were so smart it scared her sometimes . [SEP]
[CLS] would she be able to give them everything they needed as they grew up ? [SEP]
[CLS] was she a good mother ? [SEP]
[CLS] was she doing everything right ? [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed as she exited the school , her mid w ##hir ##ling with questions and ins ##ec ##urities . [SEP]
[CLS] how nice it would be if she could talk to someone , bounce her ideas off of them and have someone take a bit of the worry away . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t have that . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a single mother of twin boys who were always running around , always chasing something , curious about anything that moved , and if it did n ' t move , they wanted to know why . [SEP]
[CLS] if she was n ' t working to support them , she was searching the internet to keep up with their questions . [SEP]
[CLS] but no matter how exhaust ##ing it was , she loved them and knew she ' d never give them up for anything or anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] even a man who needed an heir , she thought angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d walked out , he ' d rejected her letter , he ' d never called or checked in on her . [SEP]
[CLS] he could just go on about his merry old way and raise oil prices or let them fall , whatever made his day . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never find out about her sons ! [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d tried to let him know about their existence but he ' d rejected that letter , had n ' t even opened the letter since it was ` ` returned to send ##er ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] at the warehouse , she went to her office , smiling at the employees who were already on duty , chatting with several of them about deliveries and inventor ##ies , before moving on to her office . [SEP]
[CLS] once there , she closed her door , something she rarely did , and sat down in her chair to try and figure out what to do . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to think through this latest news carefully , put it into perspective and then move on with her life . [SEP]
[CLS] malik ' s marriage or dissolution of his marriage had no bearing on her life . [SEP]
[CLS] she was independent , she ' d worked hard to build up her toy business and she had two wonderful boys that depended on her . [SEP]
[CLS] the days were always chaotic and she worked hard , proud of the company she ' d built up four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d built up this toy company from nothing , just an idea to distribute educational toys for kids , working hard over the years to ensure its success . [SEP]
[CLS] there were several people who had n ' t liked working for someone younger , but she ' d quickly changed their minds as she ' d grown the company , expanding and giving all of them more opportunities . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea for her company had come to her almost immediately after she ' d discovered she was pregnant . [SEP]
[CLS] she and her mother had been searching for toys that would be appropriate for what she ' d thought would be her only child . [SEP]
[CLS] what they ' d been able to find had been some great toys , some bad ones and some med ##io ##cre , but nothing all in one spot . [SEP]
[CLS] after a great deal of trial and error , she ' d created a web site that consolidated all of the toys she thought were educational and beneficial to kids at various stages of their lives . [SEP]
[CLS] the web site had taken off and she ' d quickly expanded from her parents ' dining room to a small store , and then to this warehouse that could hold a larger inventory so she could get the toys out to her customers more quickly as well as several other retail stores . [SEP]
[CLS] at lunch , her assistant placed a sandwich beside her elbow and sir ##i smiled her thanks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you close the door again , jane ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as the woman was walking out . [SEP]
[CLS] jane was startled at the unprecedented request but complied and , as soon as she was alone , sir ##i put her head in her hands , closing her eyes and trying to push the memories at bay . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to think about him but that article this morning had really gotten to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked out her window at the dr ##iz ##zle that continued to fall , her mind traveling back to those hal ##cy ##on days when everything was rosy and beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] and she had n ' t known the pain of a man ' s betrayal . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 2 four years ago sir ##i glanced once more at her date for the night , wondering what in the world she possibly could have seen in him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was in her second year of university and he was in his last so when he ' d asked if she could accompany him on a dinner with his new boss , she ' d eagerly accepted , thinking it would be nice to spend some time with people who might be intellectual ##ly stimulating . [SEP]
[CLS] not to mention gary was a very handsome man . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t mind getting to know him better , and maybe something could grow . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d spent some time together at coffee shops and study groups although she ' d been too intimidated by everyone else to speak up much . [SEP]
[CLS] as she listened to him now , she could n ' t believe how stupid he was . [SEP]
[CLS] if he mis - quoted one more philosopher , she might have to say something . [SEP]
[CLS] looking at their dinner companions , gary ' s new boss and his extremely patient wife , she was n ' t sure if they were just bored out of their minds by gary ' s mono ##logue on why he ' d adopted various aspects of some philosophers ' doctrines , disc ##arding other parts as ` ` super ##fl ##uous ' ' or ` ` redundant ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] or if they were thinking of something else just to keep their minds off of what gary was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] when he once again ascribed aristotle to the introduction of forms to philosophy instead of plato , sir ##i looked away , unwilling to see if their dinner companions , and gary ' s future employer , agreed or were showing contempt at the man ' s b ##lat ##ant abuse of the great philosophers . [SEP]
[CLS] as she glanced to her right , her eyes collided with a pair of dark , amused ones . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was exceptionally handsome with dark , wavy hair and a strong jaw , and a half smiling mouth that showed he too had overheard gary ' s comments . [SEP]
[CLS] this man , whoever he was , understood the differences between plato and aristotle and was n ' t impressed with sir ##i ' s dinner companion . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced away , feeling somewhat odd with that man ' s gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] she placed a hand over her flutter ##y stomach and picked up her ice water , taking a long draw to cool herself down . [SEP]
[CLS] trying hard to focus on the conversation , hoping she might be able to live ##n it up a bit , she waited for a break in gary ' s dia ##tri ##be about du ##rk ##heim . [SEP]
[CLS] how had they gone from philosophy to sociology ? [SEP]
[CLS] she really must have missed a great deal of the conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] their food arrived and she picked up her fork , hoping gary would also take the hint and start eating . [SEP]
[CLS] his boss appeared to be moving out of the bored range and into the irritated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gary , that looks delicious . [SEP]
[CLS] what did you order ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , only to be polite . [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t work and gary shifted back to philosophy after declaring em ##pha ##tically that ag ##nostic ##s , like he claimed to be , should n ' t limit their world after rejecting the existence of a divine being . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i actually choked on her water with that one and her eyes went once more to the man at the next table . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , he was looking right back at her with an eyebrow raised in question . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried very hard to sm ##oth ##er the amusement at gary ' s confusion with ag ##nostic ##s versus atheist ##s , but she kept quiet and just prayed to the divine being that she sincerely believed in , that this dinner would end quickly and their dinner companions were unaware of gary ' s ga ##ffe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when the meal was finally over , gary ' s ex ##uber ##ance over his performance was as ##tou ##nding . [SEP]
[CLS] the four of them were walking out of the restaurant and sir ##i pulled her wrap closer around her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t that it was chilly so much as she did n ' t want gary to touch her bare skin . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so repulsed by his ignorance that she could n ' t deal with any kind of affection from him . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the side and once again , she found herself caught up in the stranger ' s gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] he was surrounded by his dinner companions , but he was n ' t paying any attention to them , just as she was in an island that seemed to contain only herself and the man standing ten feet away . [SEP]
[CLS] he was much taller than she ' d originally have guessed and in the brighter light of the valet area , she could see that his eyes were genuinely a light grey and were n ' t a factor from the dim lighting of the restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] he was handsome , in an off - hand kind of way . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t so much his looks though , but something that was all ##uring about his appearance , something that drew one ' s eyes towards him . [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t release her eyes and she felt captured , unable to look away , unable to hear anything that was going on around her and she was n ' t sure if she was standing or sitting , just too trans ##fixed to do anything other than stand there until he released her . [SEP]
[CLS] fortunately , she did n ' t really mind the hold he had over her . [SEP]
[CLS] this stranger ' s gaze was much more enjoyable than anything that was going on around her . [SEP]
[CLS] until gary realized that she was n ' t paying attention to him . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabbed her arm and nudged her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked in an almost angry tone . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i blinked and that seemed to break the magic . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked away , noticed where she was , that three pairs of eyes were waiting on her expect ##antly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , i dazed out for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] did someone ask me a question ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] gary puff ##ed up like some angry cave man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i asked if you knew that man over there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced back , but the tall man was getting into a large , black sport utility vehicle , disappearing from her sight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never met him before , ' ' she replied honestly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he was sitting at the table next to ours during dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then why were you staring at him like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced away , feeling slightly guilty . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] he was just . . . . ' ' she shook her head , unable to explain what had gone on between herself and the stranger . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t explain it in her mind , so putting words to her feelings and reactions was n ' t really possible . [SEP]
[CLS] gary cursed under his breath and turned back to his future boss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , mr . meyer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i is n ' t usually this rude . [SEP]
[CLS] i suppose i simply made the wrong choice in companions for the evening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked at the man who had been boring her all evening , her mouth falling open in astonishment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you heard me , ' ' gary replied , shaking his head in disdain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re rude and inc ##ons ##ider ##ate and i do n ' t think we ' re going to work out well together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i laughed and took a step back . [SEP]
[CLS] turning to the other couple , she smiled brightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mr . meyer ##s , ms . meyer ##s , i appreciate the dinner tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] the food was exceptionally good . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the man you are considering hiring does n ' t know the difference between plato , who ' s primary doctrine was about forms and their abstract meaning , to put a great mind in a nuts ##hell , ' ' she said turning to glare at gary , ` ` and aristotle , who was a student of plato . [SEP]
[CLS] and how on earth you thought du ##rk ##heim was a companion of socrates is beyond me , since the man was born in france several centuries after socrates died , over thirteen hundred miles from athens , greece . [SEP]
[CLS] not only that , du ##rk ##heim studied sociology . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was just about to turn away when she thought of one other subject . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , and one other stupid comment ? [SEP]
[CLS] atheist ##s do n ' t believe in a divine being . [SEP]
[CLS] ag ##nostic ##s accept the existence of a divine being is unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] a subtle difference , but one your mind is too small to understand . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the other couple , surprised to see their amusement at her comments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well said , ' ' mr . meyer ##s replied , the first time he revealed that he was fully aware of all the un ##int ##elli ##gent comments gary had mouthed during the dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please give me a call when you ' re ready for a job . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' d like to talk to you about possibilities , ' ' he said , handing her his business card . [SEP]
[CLS] looking back at gary , ` ` i do n ' t think that position we discussed is going to work out after all . [SEP]
[CLS] and please do n ' t blame this young lady . [SEP]
[CLS] i was going to tell you this in the morning , but since you pushed the envelope by speaking to her so poorly a few moments ago , i decided it was pointless to pull my punches since you set the tone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ms . meyer ##s was already nodding and tucking her hand into her husband ' s elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you like a ride back to your apartment , sir ##i ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure i ' m comfortable with you going back with this young man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced up at gary and stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s very consider ##ate of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about catching a cab back to her place , but gary was red enough in the face to be a problem so it was probably better to get out of the area . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she did n ' t really have the funds for a cab ride . [SEP]
[CLS] the dress had cost her a great deal , not to mention the shoes that were biting into the tender flesh of her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] the valet arrived at that moment , handing keys to both gary and mr . meyer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i followed the couple , slipping into their back seat and refusing to glance at gary the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] she was relieved when the older couple pulled away from the curb , both of them chatting away at some of gary ' s more idiot ##ic comments during the meal . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day , sir ##i was in her tiny apartment that she shared with another student . [SEP]
[CLS] both of them were studying , relaxed on the battered sofa and chair that made up their den area . [SEP]
[CLS] both pieces of furniture had seen better days but were covered with blankets or sheets that hid the worst of their wear . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had gone to her two classes for the day already and was propped up on the chair with her legs hanging over the side , her brown , slightly curly hair piled on top of her head , held there with a couple of pencil ##s and a pen . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a highlight ##er in one hand and was flipping the pages of her art history book , making notes in the margins with the pen and highlighting anything that might be per ##tine ##nt in the text . [SEP]
[CLS] when the doorbell rang , her roommate , linda , jumped up and answered the door , dumping her calculus book onto the floor eagerly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` expecting someone ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe an agitated , unemployed idiot perhaps ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she joked , referring to gary . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had told her all about the meal as soon as she ' d gotten home last night , both of them laughing at some of gary ' s comments . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not for me , ' ' sir ##i said , focusing on the history of renaissance paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] in the back of her mind , sir ##i heard linda answer the door , but the mumbled greeting ##s did n ' t break her concentration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` uh , sir ##i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda called out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell them i ' m not here , ' ' she called back , knowing that whoever it was could hear her comments but still hoping they would be discouraged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` um . . . i ' m not sure this guy is going to take no for an answer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that got through to sir ##i and she glanced up from her book . [SEP]
[CLS] when she saw the tall man in the dark suit standing in her kitchen , the only other area besides the den and the two bedrooms which were on opposite sides of the den , sir ##i jumped up , dumping her books and notes all over the orange , sha ##g carpet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out and looked down at the papers , then back up at the gorgeous man who was looking at her with a blank expression on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked scar ##ier , more intimidating , in the bright afternoon sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] and much , much taller ! [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled the pen out of her hair , wishing she ' d pulled on something better than leg ##ging ##s and an old tee shirt which had definitely seen better days and only came down to her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry , ' ' she said and grabbed linda ' s boyfriend ' s shirt which was draped over the back of the only other chair in the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t expecting anyone today . [SEP]
[CLS] we were just studying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry to interrupt , ' ' the man replied with a slight accent which sir ##i could n ' t place immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought perhaps we might be formally introduced since we had such an amusing evening last night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had to laugh despite her nervous ##ness at this extremely large man in her apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was n ' t so funny towards the end , but he did serve as a good amusement factor , did n ' t he ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik took a step forward , his eyes looking over her beautiful skin for signs of abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he did n ' t hurt you , did he ? [SEP]
[CLS] i know that you confronted him at the end , and i apologize for not being there to stop him if things became physical . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him curiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was n ' t your responsibility to ensure my safety , but i appreciate the thought . [SEP]
[CLS] i can take care of myself , ' ' she claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] malik stopped his laughter , but only just in time . [SEP]
[CLS] this woman who barely reached his shoulder thought she could handle an angry man with his pride wounded in front of his future employer ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m glad to hear it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stepped back and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would like to take you out to dinner myself , if you have the time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was startled and not sure how to respond . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked to linda who was just as awe ##st ##ruck . [SEP]
[CLS] reg ##roup ##ing quickly so she did n ' t appear so ridiculous , she replied , ` ` i ' m flat ##tered , but i really do n ' t think that i ' m i your league , ' ' she stated softly , wishing that she could be in his league . [SEP]
[CLS] this man was hu ##nk material , but also terrifying for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] linda really did n ' t like sir ##i ' s response and stepped forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' d be delighted , ' ' she contra ##dict ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what time and where should she meet you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , already picking up a pen and notebook and writing something down on it . [SEP]
[CLS] malik glanced at the cute redhead who inter ##cede ##d on his behalf , app ##re ##cia ##ting her efforts . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` eight o ' clock , tomorrow night ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll pick you up here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda nodded , ignoring sir ##i ' s attempt to contra ##dict her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds perfect , ` ` she said , nodding her head for emphasis . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s sir ##i ' s cell phone number in case anything comes up . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' ll be ready tomorrow at eight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the tall , gorgeous man took the paper and bowed slightly , handing the paper to one of the large , bulky men behind him without even glancing at it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i look forward to our evening . [SEP]
[CLS] and i will work hard to ensure that i do n ' t mistake my philosophers since you apparently are so well verse ##d in their doctrines . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , he stepped out of the apartment and closed the door , leaving behind two stunned women who looked at each other as if they ' d just been invited to a royal ball . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who was that man ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda asked , when she remembered to close her mouth , her whole body showing her excitement for sir ##i ' s new man . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shrugged , still staring at the now closed door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] he was at the table next to ours last night and we looked at each other every time gary said something stupid but i do n ' t know his name . [SEP]
[CLS] and i could n ' t even guess where he ' s from since i could n ' t place his accent . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda was n ' t excited any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] she was actually looking a bit worried now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re going out with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] is that safe ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i turned to glare at her roommate , astonished that she was asking that question now after linda had just accepted the date despite sir ##i ' s rejection . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not really , ' ' she said with emphasis , raising an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but did i have a choice ? [SEP]
[CLS] not really ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda laughed and flopped back down on the sofa , her worry di ##ssi ##pati ##ng just as easily as it had appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , it ' s about time you got out and explored a little . [SEP]
[CLS] have a bit of adventure tomorrow night with your mystery guy . [SEP]
[CLS] he looks yu ##mmy , so enjoy it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i might enjoy it more if i knew his name . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment , her cell phone rang and she looked down at the tiny screen . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an unknown number , but something told her to answer the call anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hello ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she answered warily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i forgot to tell you my name , ' ' a deep voice said over the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , we were just mentioning that , ' ' she replied , glancing at linda who was watching her eagerly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m malik , ' ' he explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i ' m very glad to meet you , sir ##i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hesitated to ask , actually afraid of the answer but knowing she had to find out anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you find out who i am ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have a few resources . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and how do you know where i live ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` same resources . [SEP]
[CLS] i promise i ' m not a stalker . [SEP]
[CLS] just consider me a man interested in getting to know a beautiful woman . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you tomorrow night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced at her phone , then at linda . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his name is malik and he has ' resources ' , ' ' she explained to her curious roommate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he has a lot more than resources , ' ' linda replied with a grin before once more diving back into her books . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i tried as well to ref ##oc ##us on her art history but after that phone conversation , she had trouble concentrating . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind kept drifting back to the moment when malik had walked into her apartment , how large he was and trying to figure out what kinds of ' resources ' he could bring forth that would provide him with a stranger ' s name and address so quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] she considered calling him back and cancel ##ing since anyone with resources like that might use them for good or bad . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t someone who could fight anyone that powerful or wealthy . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the end , she did n ' t make the call and her worry changed from trying to figure out who he was to what she was going to wear on a date with someone so sophisticated . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she was also curious and rejecting the dinner date would n ' t give her the answers she now craved as to his identity . [SEP]
[CLS] the following night , she dressed in a pretty sun ##dre ##ss with bright yellow flowers all over the skirt and a yellow card ##igan . [SEP]
[CLS] spring was on the way and she felt daring , but also wanted to be a little conservative . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was definitely too confident , she thought and this dress screamed out ` ` interested ' ' but ` ` not jumping into bed with you ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] when the doorbell rang , her fingers were shaking and she glanced back to linda who was sitting o the rat ##ty old sofa with her friends eating a pizza before they all settled down for a long night of studying . [SEP]
[CLS] at least that ' s what they said they were doing . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i suspected that they were all anticipating getting a good look at the guy who was taking sir ##i out for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] as she opened the door , she glanced at her friends , all of whom were actually leaning forward , pizza forgotten , in order to get a better look at the man who was picking her up . [SEP]
[CLS] with a bright smile , she opened the door , then stepped out , closing it behind her and surprising malik who was standing at her doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t ask , ' ' she said to his questioning look as she dropped her phone and keys into her purse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s better just to walk away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she felt mischievous in not allowing her friends to see the man they ' d all cong ##re ##gated in her apartment to see . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled , then took a step back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll take your word on it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put a hand to the small of her back and led her down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] outside , a long limousine was waiting and sir ##i almost stumbled as they approached . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , hoping no one recognized her . [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped quickly into the car and hoped the darkness would hide her from the crowds looking on from the other apartments , most of whom were rented by fellow students , and all of whom were curious to see who was being picked up by a man who could afford a limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the door closed behind him , she turned to face him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i appreciate the gesture , but the limousine really is n ' t necessary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik sm ##oth ##ered a laugh and refrain ##ed from telling her that the limousine was not only necessary , but mandated by his body guards . [SEP]
[CLS] the car was n ' t just bullet proof , it was also bomb proof and loaded with enough power to transfer him out of any danger that might come up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it might not be necessary in your mind , but believe me , it ' s more than necessary in mine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was charm ##ed by his old fashioned manners and she loved talking with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea what she ate that night , or any other night after that since con ##vers ##ing with malik was better than talking with any of her companions . [SEP]
[CLS] they debated philosophy , art , history , politics and any number of subjects . [SEP]
[CLS] they had dinner together the next three nights but he had to go out of town for the weekend so she did n ' t get to see him for several days . [SEP]
[CLS] she was painfully disappointed , not just because she loved arguing with him and laughing with him , but also because she was always so excited to see him . [SEP]
[CLS] and she definitely loved the way he touched her . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of each night , he took her into his arms and kissed her until she was shivering with need . [SEP]
[CLS] the first night , he kissed her at her door . [SEP]
[CLS] the second night , he took her into his arms as soon as he picked her up , pressing her back against the wall outside of her apartment and kissing her until someone walked by . [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to take her into his arms in the back seat of the suv , but sir ##i was too shy with the man driving in the front and pulled back . [SEP]
[CLS] malik accepted her re ##tic ##ence with an amused expression , but when he dropped her off , he pulled her into his arms as soon as they were back at her apartment door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` invite me inside , sir ##i , ' ' he said before moving to her neck and ni ##bbling his way down to her collar bone . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i sighed and shook her head , enjoying the way his lips tick ##led and excited at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` linda is probably inside with her boyfriend . [SEP]
[CLS] we would n ' t have any privacy , ' ' she sighed , then gasped when his hand moved up to cover her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] her hand automatically went up to his wrist , trying to stop him , but when his thumb found her already hard nipple , she groaned and pressed his hand closer . [SEP]
[CLS] after several more minutes of this torment , he pulled back and looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tomorrow night , we ' re dining al fresco , ' ' he said with a husky tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sounds lovely , ' ' she said , ignoring the fact that he was just assuming she ' d agree to dinner with him again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` early . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll pick you up at six . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i should have said no , that she needed to study , but she did n ' t care about classes right now . [SEP]
[CLS] all she wanted was to be with malik , to laugh and listen to him , and to feel his hands on her body , to thrill at his kisses . [SEP]
[CLS] the following night , when he picked her up , she opened the door to her apartment and almost threw herself into his arms , so eager to feel his strong arms around her again . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was still shy , still not sure she wanted to move this quickly with a man she barely knew so she held back , looking down to hide her excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] they might have spent hours in each others ' company , but she did n ' t really know him personally . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that he liked italian and middle eastern foods , disliked beer and preferred wine , loved to exercise and teased her about her fear of being alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t know much about him the man , his past and all the little things that she felt were important . [SEP]
[CLS] with malik , the important part was just being with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where is al fresco occurring tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as she turned to lock her door . [SEP]
[CLS] malik was having none of that . [SEP]
[CLS] when she turned around , she gasped when she found him leaning against her door frame , one arm on either side of her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look lovely , ' ' he said a moment before he pulled her roughly into his arms , kissing her deeply and pulling her close . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i did n ' t mind , wanting this as well but she ' d been too shy . [SEP]
[CLS] malik definitely was n ' t shy and she loved the way he held her , torment ##ing her with his body . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands ran up his muscular arms , her own hands gripping his wide shoulders as she leaned up on her toes to get closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have to get out of here , ' ' he growled . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was actually embarrassed to find that her legs were wrapped around his waist , his hands on her bottom to support her while he pressed her back against the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] her breathing was rapid and she was moving against him ever so slightly , but when he started to let her down , she gripped his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and pulled him back , un ##car ##ing now if anyone saw them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do that , ' ' she replied and shifted slightly , feeling his erection against her and needing more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir ##i , ' ' he said and pressed her back , his hands moving to her thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have to get out of here . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t do this here , ' ' he said but his head bent down and kissed her again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come on , ' ' he said and lowered her gently down to the ground , watching the tension on her face as she lowered her feet back down to the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with those words , he grabbed her hands and pulled her towards the stairs , leading her quickly out into the early evening . [SEP]
[CLS] without saying a word , he pulled her into the limousine , nodding to the man holding the door . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as the door closed , he pulled her into his arms and sir ##i went willingly , not even aware of the driver this time . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the car stopped , sir ##i found that she was on his lap , st ##rad ##dling him and his hands were underneath her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t do this , malik , ' ' she said , letting her head drop backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is getting painful . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i agree , ' ' he said and pulled the strap back up on her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s go , ' ' he said and lifted her up . [SEP]
[CLS] he easily slid out of the vehicle , then reached back and pulled her out . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i held onto his hand as he led her into the lobby of an unfamiliar building . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as he pressed the call button on the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at my place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the doors to the elevator opened up and sir ##i stepped inside , her heart racing at the implication of his words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are we here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her stomach falling at both the speed at which they were ascending and the idea he ' d put into her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you know the reason , ' ' he replied , his dark eyes watching her carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you , but i wo n ' t pressure you . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a decision you have to make on your own . [SEP]
[CLS] i could walk across this elevator and take the decision out of your mind and we both know i could , but i want you completely . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you to make the decision to be with me tonight of your own free will and not something you ' ll regret in the morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked up at him , her worried eyes trying to make sense of what he was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] her body was still singing from his touch in the limousine and now he was promising her more , all un ##int ##er ##rup ##ted . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about what he was saying , about the implications and with a smile , she stepped forward , right into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t regret this , ' ' he said as he pulled her up against him , burying his face in her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , ' ' she replied , her heart already pounding rapidly and he was n ' t even kissing her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was twenty years old and ready for this step . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted very badly to know what it was like , but not badly enough to have sex with anyone other than this man with his strong arms , his intelligence and strength , his wit and the way he touched her . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted her up and carried her through the penthouse . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was n ' t really aware of the passing rooms but she was very conscious of this man and how small and fragile she felt as he held her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to turn on the lights , ' ' he said as he lowered her legs down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to see you , ' ' he explained gently . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i thought about that and smiled her agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] she might want the lights off , but then she would n ' t be able to see him and that would be a shame , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] with the soft glow of the bedside table illuminating them , he pulled her back into his arms and kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was slow and thorough and he did n ' t stop until the stiff ##ness left her shoulders and she was clinging to him once again . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers were in her hair and she reached up , wanting to touch him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] as she moved against him , she felt his fingers against her stomach , and then against her skin and she gasped with the intensity of that touch . [SEP]
[CLS] when his hand cupped her breast she jerked backwards , her eyes surprised . [SEP]
[CLS] but then she realized that she liked the heat , the spark and she slammed right back against him , her hand reaching for his to put his hand back on her breast , moaning with pleasure as his fingers slid along the skin of her breast , his thumb moving against her nipple and she could barely stand as the heat surged through her . [SEP]
[CLS] clinging to his shoulders , she gasped and moved her own hands up , rev ##elin ##g in the way he felt . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like hard silk , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] with a flick of his wrist , her bra was released and pulled off , tossed behind him and malik pulled back to look down at her half naked body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so beautiful , ' ' he growled and lifted her up so she was laying on the bed , his arms holding him above her as he tasted what he ' d just felt . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment malik ' s mouth covered her nipple sir ##i thought she would explode . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers were clenching the fabric of his shirt and she tried to catch her breath , wanting to feel his skin . [SEP]
[CLS] she tentatively un ##bu ##tton ##ed his shirt and let her fingers slide inside , testing to see if he would be angry but his reaction startled her . [SEP]
[CLS] he came off the bed and tore his shirt off , then came back to her , his hand reaching down and doing exactly as she ' d done a moment ago . [SEP]
[CLS] as his hand held hers , his eyes closed and she could see he was grit ##ting his teeth as he moved her hand along his skin . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was sure she would n ' t move her hand away , he released it and came back to her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she ' d found a sensitive spot when his mouth sucked harder and she ached with the need she did n ' t fully understand . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost painful and she lifted her legs , pressing herself against the erection she could feel on her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] malik moved to the other breast and sir ##i was n ' t sure she liked this any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , no more , ' ' she gasped as he teased her nipple , her body aroused to the point where she could n ' t take any more . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least she thought that was the case . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` much more , ' ' malik contra ##dict ##ed and moved down to her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as his mouth was gone from her breast , she missed the intensity and wanted him back , but then he kissed her stomach and she loved that as well , the feeling almost like a tick ##le , but much more intense . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid her skirt off , taking her underwear with him and , for the first time , sir ##i felt self - conscious as he looked down at her as she was completely naked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be shy , ' ' he said as his heated gaze took in her long legs and slender waist , her perfectly rounded breasts that were just the right size for his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ex ##cite ##s me to see you like this , so ready for me and open , knowing that you want me almost as much as i want you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with his words , she relaxed and looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to . . . . ' ' ` ` absolutely , ' ' he said and efficiently di ##sp ##ense ##d with his clothes , watching her the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] he suppressed a groan when she came up on her elbows , which pushed her breasts out further . [SEP]
[CLS] they were so perfect , so ripe and sweet , his mouth wanted a longer taste but she was n ' t used to that and he knew he had to take things slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands slid along her skin , enjoying how soft and silky she was . [SEP]
[CLS] he also loved the way she writ ##hed against the bed covers , looking like a goddess with the desire for him shining in her beautiful eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was trying hard , but seeing her like this was making it extremely difficult to hold back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you , ' ' he growled as he came back down , feeling her body against his without any hind ##rance this time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you to , malik , ' ' she said and moved against him , her legs automatically moving to make room for him and he inhaled sharply as he felt her heat , so close to his erection he had to lift himself off her or he would push into her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t ready yet , but almost . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand reached down , sliding along her thighs and she almost closed her legs , afraid of this next step . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as he felt her resistance , he stopped and lowered his head , kissing her until she relaxed again . [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her thighs open for him once more , he continued kissing her , moving from her mouth to her neck , then back to her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] when he covered her nipple once again , she gasped and her legs lost all resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand moved to her inner thigh , then higher and he almost lost control when he felt her heat , the wet ##ness that told him she truly was ready for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved slowly , sliding his finger inside her and shaking his head to clear his thoughts , control his body when he felt her clench around his finger . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved his finger in and out of her tight sheath , then pushed in two fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes were closed the whole time and he was free to look down at her , to watch her experience the joy ##s her body could bring her without embarrassing her . [SEP]
[CLS] when her hips pressed against his hand , he knew she was finally ready for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he slid his fingers out and positioned himself above her , pulling her legs around his waist and looking her directly in the eye as he slowly , as gently as he could , moved inside her . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth opened in surprise as he filled her , feeling his body ache with the need to move faster , to go deeper but holding back so she could adjust to his invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay , ' ' he soothe ##d when she started to pull away and it took all of his strength to stop and wait for her to adjust . [SEP]
[CLS] when he saw her breath in once again , he pressed on , moving out slightly , then back a bit deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to do this until he felt her resistance and had to close his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] gathering her close in his arms , he kissed her gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , sir ##i , ' ' he said a moment before he pushed into her . [SEP]
[CLS] he held her in his arms as she stiffened and heard her gasp of pain against his ear . [SEP]
[CLS] malik held absolutely still while she recovered , not moving at all until he felt her relax . [SEP]
[CLS] that was all the encouragement he needed . [SEP]
[CLS] still moving slowly , he slid in and out of her heat , watching her face as she experienced pleasure like this for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved the way she moved instinctively against her , feeling her heat , the ecstasy of her body against his , clenching against him and driving him insane with the need to move faster . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t stop , ' ' she cried out when she thought he was slowing down . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes closed as she lifted her hips to meet his thrusts and her fingers curled against his arms and shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t worry , ' ' he groaned and could n ' t help it when he moved faster , needing her and watching her face to gauge her response . [SEP]
[CLS] when her head fell back , he knew she was okay and moved slightly faster . [SEP]
[CLS] she took all of him , her legs lifting to take him deeper inside of her and he struggled to control his climax to ensure that she came first . [SEP]
[CLS] when he knew that he was about to lose control , he moved his hand down , teasing her and watched in fascination as she splinter ##ed almost immediately into her first orgasm . [SEP]
[CLS] he could only watch for a moment before her climax brought on his own and he slammed into her as intense waves of desire washed over him . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i ' s arms relaxed and she felt as if her whole body were made of je ##ll - o . [SEP]
[CLS] the world could be falling apart outside this room and she would n ' t even care . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , lifting himself off of her , but not letting her go . [SEP]
[CLS] he rolled over onto his back , pulling her close against him . [SEP]
[CLS] he loved the way she snuggled against him , her leg even coming up to slide against his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more than okay , ' ' she sighed and her hand moved against his ridge ##d stomach , rep ##lete with happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled away to clean up in the bathroom , but he was back in moments and pulling her back against his side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry i ' ve missed this , ' ' she said , referring to the fact that this was her first time . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her , his anger sharp and intense . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re mine , sir ##i ! [SEP]
[CLS] what we shared will be only between us , ' ' he commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] she was touched by his possessive ##ness , when in other men it would be irritating . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i was just kidding . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t even been tempted by any other man . [SEP]
[CLS] you know that , ' ' she said as her hand soothe ##d against his jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i should n ' t have made a comment like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he relaxed and nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re mine , sir ##i , ' ' he said again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that mean you ' re mine ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , pushing her hair out of her eyes and lifting herself higher so she was looking down on him for a change . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he teased , his hand sliding up her back , then down again to smooth against her bottom , making her wig ##gle and blush at the intimate touch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i do , ' ' she said with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to take me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and re - situated her so that she was laying completely on top of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are n ' t i heavy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , worried that she might be too much for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re too light , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved her legs , but his hands stopped her , forcing her legs to st ##rad ##dle him instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s better , ' ' he replied , his voice husky . [SEP]
[CLS] from that night on , whenever he was in town , she was in his arms , spending the nights with him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so busy that there were periods when she only saw him once during the month . [SEP]
[CLS] other times he was able to get away twice and they spent long weekends walking along the river , holding hands and dining out . [SEP]
[CLS] but mostly , they spent their time in bed , finding new ways to love each other . [SEP]
[CLS] she never said the words , but sir ##i was totally , completely , madly in love with this man who continued to surprise her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was older than her by twelve years but she did n ' t feel as if he ever spoke down to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he listened while she spoke , helped her study for her exams , even gave her tips on research papers . [SEP]
[CLS] and never spoke about his feelings for her . [SEP]
[CLS] so she kept hers a secret as well , loving the man , but knowing there was a large part of him he kept secret . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , she still had no idea what he did for a living . [SEP]
[CLS] every time she met him he was coming or going from one meeting or another . [SEP]
[CLS] when she asked him about it , he explained that he was negotiating a contract , but never gave her details about what kind of contract , or what company he worked for . [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed to be meeting with very high level people , but he was n ' t a name drop ##per , so she did n ' t know who he met with or why . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew he was extremely wealthy because his ' apartment ' was the penthouse of one of the most expensive buildings in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] she also knew that he had several body guards and he had n ' t arranged for the limousine for her benefit , but because that was simply the way he traveled . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t ask many questions about that either , not sure she wanted the answers . [SEP]
[CLS] six months into the affair , she was coming out of the bathroom , snuggled into his enormous white robe and rubbing her hair with a towel after her shower . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d woken about a half hour ago after spending the night in malik ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t gotten much sleep , but she did n ' t come here for sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] she came to be with him , to make love with him and enjoy his company . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked when he walked into the room , wearing only a pair of jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her into his arms and kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good morning , ' ' he said , as his hands slipped inside the robe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look beautiful , as always . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed up at him and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not getting out of answering my question . [SEP]
[CLS] why did you look so concerned when you first walked in here ? [SEP]
[CLS] is something wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and pulled her over to the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my father just called . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to get home quickly , ' ' he explained , but he did n ' t seem to be in any kind of hurry . [SEP]
[CLS] he sat down on the edge of the bed and held the ties of her robe in both hands , pulling gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` should n ' t you be getting dressed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her body already reacting to the look in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t even glancing at his watch , preferring to watch the white , terry cloth fabric as he pulled the edges slowly apart . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head slightly , his eyes intent as he looked at her naked body , still pink from the heat of the shower . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should be right here . [SEP]
[CLS] wondering what ' s underneath this robe , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled the edges closed , refusing to let him pull the robe off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you already know what ' s underneath , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you saw enough of me last night . [SEP]
[CLS] if your father needs you , why are n ' t you rushing to his side ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my father can wait a while . [SEP]
[CLS] i have a very short memory when it comes to your body . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i need a ref ##resh ##er . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she chuckled and tried to step back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have a photographic memory . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t let her move back but instead , yanked her forward , catching her in his arms and tumbling over her onto the bed so he was looking down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like how you think you can out ##man ##eu ##ver me , ' ' he said a moment before he took her ear lobe with his teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it always am ##uses me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and tried to wig ##gle away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that ' s what i ' m here for . [SEP]
[CLS] just for your entertainment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stilled and pulled away , suddenly looking at her seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t say that , ' ' he said stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` say what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never seen him look at her like that , as if he were worried and angry at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not just my entertainment , ' ' he replied , his eyes serious . [SEP]
[CLS] she reached up and touched his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t mean to bel ##itt ##le what we have together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he watched her for a moment before turning his face into her hand , kissing her palm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t forget it , ' ' he growled before pulling her close , becoming serious for a whole different reason . [SEP]
[CLS] that was the last time she saw him in person . [SEP]
[CLS] three days later , sir ##i was sitting in their tiny apartment when linda arrived back from the grocery store , her eyes wide with concern . [SEP]
[CLS] she placed the groceries on the kitchen table and looked over at sir ##i , one hand hiding something behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i asked as linda walked into the apartment and sat down across from her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look worried about something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you know where malik is from ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shrugged and glanced down at her economics book . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s mentioned traveling to several countries lately , but he told me he ' s originally from dub ##an . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda cringed and crossed her legs , obviously about to say something horrible and not sure how to convey the message . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you know anything else about him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i closed her economics book and started to become worried . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that he hates bro ##cco ##li and as ##para ##gus , loves the opera and ballet and rides horses extremely well . [SEP]
[CLS] other than that , most of my knowledge is about the conversations we ' ve had on various subjects . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she watched linda ' s eyes , concern growing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` has something happened to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] is he okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] please tell me he ' s not hurt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s not , ' ' linda assured her quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nothing like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked out the window briefly before bringing her gaze back to the floor , unable to look sir ##i in the eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at least , i have n ' t heard anything like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i relaxed and leaned back against the worn cushions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` w ##he ##w ! [SEP]
[CLS] you were starting to worry me . [SEP]
[CLS] i could n ' t figure out what might be so concerning about malik . [SEP]
[CLS] has something happened in dub ##an ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda looked at the newspaper , then back up at sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could say that , ' ' she said and handed the paper to sir ##i with the headlines on the front page , pointing to the lead story so sir ##i could easily see the issue . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced down , not sure what she might read . [SEP]
[CLS] but the picture was bad enough . [SEP]
[CLS] on the front page was a picture of the royal family of dub ##an , with malik in the middle . [SEP]
[CLS] if that was n ' t bad enough , the woman with the beautiful smile and long , flowing black hair , gazing up at him with ad ##orin ##g eyes , was enough to make sir ##i feel sick . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` crown prince malik bin sa ##q ##qa ##f , she ##ik of dub ##an married yesterday in a formal ceremony . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the article went on to give the woman ' s name and describe the ceremony , explain why everyone should care about this marriage , but all sir ##i could see was malik ' s handsome face , looking stern , almost angry , as he stared out from the picture while surrounded by his family and new bride . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to go , ' ' sir ##i said and hurried into her bedroom , slamming the door behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t face linda after reading the article . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t face anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time she ' d read the last word that described the elaborate ceremony and the exciting engagement , the surprise to the whole world that the crown prince was engaged without anyone in the world knowing , she was numb , unable to process anything else in her own sphere . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t cry . [SEP]
[CLS] not for several days . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t cry , could n ' t believe that he ' d actually done this to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d betrayed her . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d cheated on her , he ' d lied to her and married only days after spending the night with her ! [SEP]
[CLS] a full week went by and sir ##i barely came out of her room . [SEP]
[CLS] she drank coffee and had toast when linda forced it on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she went to her classes but did n ' t hear anything . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked around campus , but barely knew what was going on . [SEP]
[CLS] living on coffee most of the time , she did n ' t even care that her grades had fallen or that she had lost so much weight that her clothes could barely stay on her figure . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been thin before , but now she could only be described as gaunt . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even realize that her friends were discussing how best to help her , because none of their suggestions even broke through the pain filled haze she was living in . [SEP]
[CLS] it took over a month before sir ##i felt well enough to talk to linda about malik and even then , she ' d barely gotten out a few words before she broke down in tears . [SEP]
[CLS] linda was the ep ##ito ##me of patience , but even she could n ' t help her friend through this kind of betrayal . [SEP]
[CLS] letters came addressed to her in malik ' s handwriting , but sir ##i returned them all , rejecting any explanation he might have . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing he said could justify what he ' d done to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure how she would have felt if he ' d told her about his engagement before she ' d become intimate . [SEP]
[CLS] would she have understood ? [SEP]
[CLS] surely she would n ' t have felt so . . . . abused , so completely . . . . she could n ' t really put a name to what she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] her pain seemed to be beyond anything she ' d felt before . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had dated men in the past , had even thought she ' d cared about them . [SEP]
[CLS] but never had she considered becoming intimate with any of them , nor had she given her heart and her soul so completely as she ' d done with malik . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d trusted him with her heart , with the most intimate part of her and he ' d stomped on that trust , on her love . [SEP]
[CLS] not that she ' d actually told him how she ' d felt . [SEP]
[CLS] and thank goodness for that , she thought one day on the way to one of her classes . [SEP]
[CLS] and then the brutal part happened . [SEP]
[CLS] two months after that last weekend , sir ##i found herself in the bathroom throwing up , her whole body wr ##ack ##ed with the pain of empty ##ing an already empty stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] a few hours later , she felt fine and went to class , but when the same thing happened the following day , she had to question what was really happening . [SEP]
[CLS] a pregnancy test confirmed her fears . [SEP]
[CLS] and a month later , a son ##og ##ram confirmed twins . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had sent a letter to malik but was n ' t sure how to address the letter . [SEP]
[CLS] the news that she was pregnant was hard to write , but she was as plain as possible , not el ##ab ##ora ##ting but just stating the news . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave him the facts , about her due date , the twins , she did n ' t know the gender but that the babies were healthy so far . [SEP]
[CLS] she outlined the plan the doctor had given her for the pregnancy , how she would have additional appointments to ensure that the babies were delivered successfully and healthy and anything else she could relate about the pregnancy while leaving out anything personal . [SEP]
[CLS] when the letter arrived back , she crushed it in her fist , scared out of her mind at idea of facing parent ##hood as a single mother . [SEP]
[CLS] in the back of her mind , she realized that she ' d still held out the hope that he would come to her and tell her that the marriage to another woman was n ' t real , that he loved her and would push the other woman aside so they could be married themselves and raise their babies together . [SEP]
[CLS] the rejection of that letter was yet another slap in the face to her hopes and dreams and sir ##i hated malik even more for that . [SEP]
[CLS] going back to her parents after that last semester had been horrible but both her mother and father were delighted that they were going to be grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] they helped her finish school and start her business , encouraging her the whole way . [SEP]
[CLS] when the twins were born , they were right there helping her through every moment and she loved them for all of their support . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d gotten through it , sir ##i thought , looking around at her office , now paper ##ed with the pictures jacob and sam had made during preschool art classes . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d started her business out of her parent ' s house , starting out only as an online distribution website for educational toys . [SEP]
[CLS] as success came , she expanded to a store in one of the suburbs , and then two , and now she had five stores , plus her online business had more than doubled over the past year with internet sales sky ##rock ##eti ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] she could work from home when the boys were sick and , since she was the boss , it was easier for her to be at their programs , to celebrate the small and the large events of their lives . [SEP]
[CLS] as hard as it had been initially , she was finally at a place where she felt secure , and that she had things somewhat under control . [SEP]
[CLS] and now life hits her with another w ##ham ##my ! [SEP]
[CLS] why was he di ##vor ##cing ? [SEP]
[CLS] and did she even care ? [SEP]
[CLS] after that first month , he had n ' t tried to get in touch with her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d read about two years ago that his father had died and he ' d taken full control of the country . [SEP]
[CLS] it seemed strange that the man she ' d laughed with and made love to throughout all hours of the night , who was the secret father of her children was actually ruler of one of the wealthiest countries in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` joe needs you on the floor , ' ' her assistant said , poking her head into sir ##i ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` something about a sale to hong kong . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i blinked and came back to the present . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have time to deal with this now . [SEP]
[CLS] malik was far away dealing with his problems and she had to deal with her own . [SEP]
[CLS] wherever he was , whatever he was doing , she could n ' t let it interfere with the raising of her boys and , besides lots of hugs and kisses , her business was the core of that care . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t let them down . [SEP]
[CLS] standing up , she took a moment to straighten the files on her desk , then went down to the warehouse floor to figure out what the problem was . [SEP]
[CLS] malik watched as sir ##i moved about the warehouse . [SEP]
[CLS] she was grace and elegance and she ' d actually become more beautiful over the past four years . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t count the number of hours he ' d spent fan ##tas ##izing about being with her again . [SEP]
[CLS] the past four years had been the hardest of his life but he was now free to pursue the woman he was meant to be with . [SEP]
[CLS] he was fascinated by the way she moved about . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so efficient and professional . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman he ' d known had been intelligent and witty , but also shy around other people . [SEP]
[CLS] this woman approached the employees with confidence and a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] although he could n ' t hear her words , with each person , she treated them with respect and it seemed as if she was encouraging them while speaking with each one . [SEP]
[CLS] she was stronger , he thought as she carried a clip board around , checking in with her employees and asking questions , always leaving them with a smile to show that she respected them and appreciated their work and their time . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d expect nothing less of her , he just wished he ' d been around to watch the transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] once again , he cursed the forces that had required his marriage , specifically his father who had destroyed treaties that had ended badly with violence . [SEP]
[CLS] he understood why his father had done that , and might even agree with him , but he had n ' t liked the resolution to the hostilities , which had been his marriage to the daughter of a tribal leader , one that would unite their two families and ensure peace . [SEP]
[CLS] his marriage had been a necessity , one that he ' d carried out as an obligation , but there had been no love between him and his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d both made a half hearted effort to make the relationship work , but between the politics and the regional fighting , the separation ##s and . . . . well , lots of things , their marriage had been bound to fail from the beginning . [SEP]
[CLS] that was fine with him though . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t wanted to marry her , he ' d wanted sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] but sir ##i had n ' t had the right political connections and his ex - wife had been perfect for the job . [SEP]
[CLS] so they ' d both done what they ' d been raised to do , and that was to protect their countries and create a bond . [SEP]
[CLS] now that the bond was no longer needed , they had parted ways , leaving him free to pursue this woman who became more interesting the more he watched . [SEP]
[CLS] he was standing in the office area high above the warehouse but he could see down from the window that looked into the vast warehouse space . [SEP]
[CLS] he saw sir ##i ' s efficient and bu ##bbly assistant as she tried to catch her boss , but the assistant with her bright , curly hair was on one side of the warehouse , while sir ##i was on the other . [SEP]
[CLS] although the amusing chase was interesting , he did n ' t have a great deal of time , nor any patience to wait . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d waited four years to see his woman and he was n ' t going to delay any longer than necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted sir ##i in his arms and in his bed , he wanted to pick up where they left off and find a way to forge a future between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d already cleared the path for their marriage with his advisors . [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t asked , he ' d told them who he was going after . [SEP]
[CLS] with his marriage behind him , they all agreed enthusiastically that a new marriage , to a woman malik cared for , was the answer to ensuring prosperity in the kingdom and longevity of his line . [SEP]
[CLS] malik watched with a chuckle as the assistant ' s head bobbed in one direction in search of sir ##i , while their prey moved in the opposite direction . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously , this was n ' t the most effective way to bring sir ##i to him , he realized . [SEP]
[CLS] malik pulled out his cell phone and dialed the number his assistant had given him . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , as soon as he heard the answering ring , sir ##i looked down at her waist where her cell phone was attached . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced at the phone number and he could even see her biting her lip in ind ##ec ##ision . [SEP]
[CLS] he almost chuckled when she pressed the ` ` ignore ' ' button and slammed the phone back into the holder at her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] she was cute when she was irritated , but that also gave him an idea of what was coming . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of calling her again , which she would probably ignore once again , he texted her a message , then pressed send and waited , watching for her reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked at her clip board again but the words and numbers did n ' t register in her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] that phone number . . . . it could n ' t be him . [SEP]
[CLS] could it ? [SEP]
[CLS] how could he have the same phone number he ' d had four years ago ? [SEP]
[CLS] and why in the world had she remembered that phone number ? [SEP]
[CLS] this definitely was n ' t the same phone so she did n ' t have the number programmed in as she had in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] when he ' d called four years ago , his name had popped up on the small screen and she ' d eagerly taken the call , excited to find out when he would be back in chicago . [SEP]
[CLS] now , however , she wanted nothing to do with the man . [SEP]
[CLS] burn me once , shame on you . [SEP]
[CLS] burn me twice , shame on me . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way she was even talking to the man who left her one day and turned up married to another woman the next day , without a word or explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , so he might have tried to explain in the letters she ' d rejected , but at the time , she was too furious with him for any explanations . [SEP]
[CLS] then , once she found out she was pregnant and her own letter had come back rejected , she ' d been too terrified of what was to come . [SEP]
[CLS] explanations were n ' t worth much at that point , she ' d needed help and she ' d gotten none , except from her mother and father who had been absolutely wonderful throughout her whole terrifying and difficult pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] he had no idea how hard it is to carry twins , attend classes and start one ' s business all at the same time ! [SEP]
[CLS] he could rot at the other end of the line for all she cared ! [SEP]
[CLS] the man was as good as dead in her heart . [SEP]
[CLS] how dare he even try to call her after all these years , she fu ##med ! [SEP]
[CLS] his first marriage ended so now he ' s going to try and pick up where he left off ? [SEP]
[CLS] as if nothing had occurred in between ? [SEP]
[CLS] as if he had n ' t completely rejected everything they stood for while they ' d been together ? [SEP]
[CLS] what arrogance ! [SEP]
[CLS] there she went again , thinking that he might have thought their relationship as significant as she had . [SEP]
[CLS] to him , she ' d probably just been an affair , a w ##him . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d come to the conclusion that she ' d been his ` ` port ' ' lady , the woman he comes to when he ' s in this particular city but meant nothing to him since he most likely had , and still had , women in several other ports that met his needs there . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to stop thinking that she ' d meant anything at all to him . [SEP]
[CLS] if she had , he never could have betrayed her like that . [SEP]
[CLS] goodness , why was she even thinking about all this ? [SEP]
[CLS] she had work to do and a phone call from a man who had abandoned her was not going to distract her from her goals for the day . [SEP]
[CLS] she had shipments to review , both incoming and outgoing . [SEP]
[CLS] she had payroll to approve , a marketing meeting later this afternoon , financial reports to go over , new products to test and a million other things that were more urgent . . . she did n ' t have time to dream about painful methods of retribution to a man she ' d never see again since he was a million miles away . [SEP]
[CLS] she was walking towards the loading docks when her cell phone vibrated , indicating a text message . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at the screen and almost dropped the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ' i ' ve missed you ' was all the screen said , but the phone number from which the message had come was from that same number , the one she was n ' t going to touch ! [SEP]
[CLS] she deleted the text , ignoring it completely and headed towards the busy loading docks once again , furious that the ob ##no ##xious man thought he could just casually pop back into her life . [SEP]
[CLS] she was almost to the docks when her phone vibrated again . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost dropped the clip board in her fury , but was able to control herself . [SEP]
[CLS] barely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can we meet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the message said . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i wanted to throw her phone across the bust ##ling warehouse . [SEP]
[CLS] the crash would be very satisfying , but unfortunately , it was n ' t malik ' s arrogant head so it would n ' t really count . [SEP]
[CLS] and it would only cost her more money and time to replace her phone and that man had cost her a whole lot of money . [SEP]
[CLS] well , to be fair , he ' d also gifted her with her two little wonderful boys . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced down at her watch and was relieved that she still had some precious time before she had to pick them up . [SEP]
[CLS] she really just needed to focus and get through her day before it became too late . [SEP]
[CLS] the next message came just as she was about to call over her loading manager , a barrel chest ##ed man with an old fashioned handle ##bar mustache in his late fifties who pushed through the merchandise with a tight leash , ensuring that all shipments were accurate and on time . [SEP]
[CLS] since hiring him three years ago , her complaints had dropped to almost nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was a genuine treasure and had relieved a great deal of stress when he ' d implemented his shipping procedures soon after his arrival . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi joe , ' ' she called out as she approached , forcing her mind to concentrate on the shipments that were coming in and not on the text messages she ' d just received . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are the latest shipments ? [SEP]
[CLS] will they be ready in time for . . . . ' ' she started to ask but then shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` joe , i apologize . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t even finish that question because i know you have it all under control and any shipments that are scheduled to go out will happen . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just losing focus today and it ' s coming out in odd ways . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she almost picked up her cell phone and glared at it just for good measure but knew that the effort would be lost on the ina ##ni ##mate object . [SEP]
[CLS] joe ' s eyes widened slightly and then he chuckled , his mustache twitching mer ##rily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks for the unexpected compliment ms . sir ##i , but feel free to ask anything you ' d like . [SEP]
[CLS] we have all one hundred and fifty parcels ready to ship in the next hour and gerry is at the packaging convey ##or belt making sure that tomorrow ' s shipments are ready as well . [SEP]
[CLS] we have the computer check ##list tory built up last month and it ' s working real well so we ' re actually slightly ahead of schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of this month , we should be even better and only the last minute , overnight orders will be a daily exception . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the man ' s voice was gruff from years of yelling at the nascar races and probably too many cigarettes and beer , but he was a gem as a manager . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks joe . [SEP]
[CLS] sorry for the questions . [SEP]
[CLS] just trying to out ##run something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] or someone , she thought with irritation . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned on her heel and walked back towards the offices , determined to get payroll finished before she left for the night . [SEP]
[CLS] mary , her payroll manager , was already hard at work ensuring that all fifty - nine employees got paid on time and she ' d never missed a deadline yet , but she also needed sir ##i ' s approval to make those deadline ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] again , her cell phone vibrated and sir ##i considered just ignoring the message this time , sure that whatever message just came through , it was definitely from him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to know what he had to say . [SEP]
[CLS] but her eyes glanced down and she gasped when she read the words , ` ` you look beautiful , by the way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 3 how could he know what she looked like ? [SEP]
[CLS] was he here ? [SEP]
[CLS] how could he know ? [SEP]
[CLS] was he just saying that to mess with her mind ? [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t his style , but who knows what he is like now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the red sweater looks good , ' ' came the next message . [SEP]
[CLS] with those words , she knew that he was here . [SEP]
[CLS] in her warehouse ! [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way he could know what she was wearing from over in dub ##an or wherever he might be in the world ! [SEP]
[CLS] he could only know she was wearing a red sweater if he was actually looking at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , her heart pounding and her hands starting to sweat . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe that he was actually here ! [SEP]
[CLS] fury pounded through her and she glanced up towards her office window . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , there he was , standing in the window watching her . [SEP]
[CLS] how long had he been there ? [SEP]
[CLS] had he been watching her the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced down at her cell phone , noting the time of the first call . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been here for at least fifteen minutes ! [SEP]
[CLS] damn that man ! [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way she would allow him to invade her space . [SEP]
[CLS] this was her personal domain and she would n ' t permit him to come here and flu ##ster her or make her crazy the way he ' d been doing for the past few minutes ! [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d given up the right to speak to her casually , to give her compliment ##s or anything else four years ago when he ' d married another woman only days after spending the night with her ! [SEP]
[CLS] dorothy , her assistant , rushed up to her , out of breath and sweating slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i finally found you ! [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s a guy up in your office . [SEP]
[CLS] a gorgeous guy ! [SEP]
[CLS] he asked if he could see you and he has the most amazing accent you ' ve ever heard ! [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' s buff ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she finally finished , her eyes wide with excitement and curiosity . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman was completely discrete about anything that was happening in the office , but sir ##i looked at her flushed cheeks and knew she ' d never con ##fide her relationship with malik to anyone here in the warehouse or office . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that dorothy expected sir ##i to drop everything she was doing so she could run up and see the ' buff ' guy only irritated sir ##i more , but she tried to hide it . [SEP]
[CLS] dorothy was n ' t the target here . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all on malik ' s end that she wanted to shoot darts at . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why is he here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i asked , grit ##ting her teeth to keep from snapping off her assistant ' s head at the idea that malik was ' gorgeous ' . [SEP]
[CLS] if she only knew what kind of a weasel that man was , dorothy would n ' t think he was so nice to look at . [SEP]
[CLS] no amount of muscles could compensate for a poor character and low morals . [SEP]
[CLS] dorothy ' s curls bounced as she pointed towards the offices above the warehouse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he said something about wanting to talk with you . [SEP]
[CLS] he mentioned he was an old friend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` old enemy , more like it , ' ' sir ##i mumbled underneath her breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks dorothy . [SEP]
[CLS] tell mary i ' ll be in to approve the payroll in a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] i just need to get rid of a bug . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dorothy stared after her boss , eyes wide at the idea that the man in her office could possibly be the bug upon which her boss might st ##omp . [SEP]
[CLS] surely she ' d misunderstood . [SEP]
[CLS] the charming , marvelous fellow she ' d spoken to several minutes ago could never be thought of as an unwanted pest ! [SEP]
[CLS] either that , or her boss was just teasing . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , that must be it , she thought as she watched sir ##i walked with determination towards the offices . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t want him , send him my way ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dorothy called out . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i barely hesitated as she heard her assistant ' s bell ##ow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` believe me , you do n ' t want this kind of cock ##ro ##ach , ' ' sir ##i called back . [SEP]
[CLS] she practically ran up the metal stairs in order to get to her office more quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted malik out of her office , out of her warehouse and out of her life . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated this man so deeply she could n ' t believe that she had it in her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who the hell do you think . . . ' ' she started to say but he cut her off , simply by taking her into his arms and covering her angry mouth with his . [SEP]
[CLS] his kiss was hot , sexy and so b ##lat ##antly erotic there was nothing sir ##i could do but kiss him back . [SEP]
[CLS] her clip board fell to the floor , forgotten as her hands gripped the lap ##els of his perfectly tailored charcoal suit . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands , which had been holding both sides of her face , moved down to pull her against him , to show her that he was just as affected by the kiss as she was . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time he lifted his head , sir ##i was clinging to him , her mind a ju ##mble and her voice whimper ##ing with need she ' d thought was pushed out of her life at his departure four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] as he looked down at her , his eyes smiling into her stunned ones , he kissed her cheek and her ear , before pulling back once again to look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve missed you , sir ##i , ' ' he said softly , his hands roaming over her back and sending shivers of anticipation all over her body . [SEP]
[CLS] no one knew how to touch a woman , how to touch her , like malik . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew all of her secrets , all the places on her body that sent excitement and desire z ##inging through her system and he used all of that knowledge to his benefit now . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i pulled back just far enough , then with all of her might , she swung out , smack ##ing him hard on his cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] her hand stung from the impact and she could see the red imprint of her hand on his cheek but was unaware of the tears streaming down her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get out ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she growled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never want to see you again ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to take a deep breath to calm down , but her body ' s betrayal had only made her ang ##rier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you would do something like that after so many years and after what you did ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he started to say something but she picked up her clip ##board and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get out of my office , get out of my warehouse and get out of my life ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she swung around and was just about to leave her office when he grabbed her arm , swinging her around and pushing her against the wall by the door to her office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i deserved the slap . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that and i ' m sorry for the pain i caused you in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] but i can explain , ' ' he said , his voice rough and yet still soft , gently soothing . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to jerk away , but no matter how soft his voice , his hands were steel around her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t touch me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped and tried to look away when his finger came up and touched her cheek , tenderly wiping away the tears on her flushed cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll leave now , but we ' re going to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] after that kiss we just shared , you know there ' s something still between us and we can make this work . [SEP]
[CLS] you just have to let it . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re angry now and i deserve it all , and probably a lot more . [SEP]
[CLS] but we can work through this and make things better . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can just . . . ' ' she started to say something , but shook her head and took a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not going to get to me , ' ' she said with as much dignity as possible under the circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you left four years ago , you can just leave again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , she turned around and headed down the office hallway , un ##car ##ing of where she was going as long as it was the opposite direction from him . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to be as far away from him as she could get , but the warehouse offices were n ' t very large . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked to the kitchen and looked out the front window , seeing the long , elegant limousine parked out front . [SEP]
[CLS] she swallowed painfully since the car reminded her of the times he ' d picked her up in those long ago . [SEP]
[CLS] why had n ' t she looked into him more carefully ? [SEP]
[CLS] why had she just let things go , happy to be with him and not asking any questions ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t stupid , she should have asked questions , been curious at least . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never asked any questions about his past , about his family . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never offered and she had n ' t wanted to pry into issues he did n ' t offer information about . [SEP]
[CLS] looking back , she should have demanded answers to things that did n ' t make sense . [SEP]
[CLS] she should have refused to enter into an intimate relationship with a man she did n ' t fully know . [SEP]
[CLS] but at the time , she ' d been overwhelmed by everything about him and the way he made her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] she sank down into the one of the kitchen chairs , lowering her head onto her palm , trying to calm down enough to go back to work . [SEP]
[CLS] out of the corner of her eye she saw the limousine pull away and drive out of the parking lot and thought she even saw two dark suv ##s in front of and following the long car . [SEP]
[CLS] yet another mystery , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] wiping the tears away , she pushed herself up and forced herself to walk down to mary ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is payroll ready yet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying for an even tone . [SEP]
[CLS] mary did a double take when she saw sir ##i ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shook her head and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] i just had a bad memory but it ' s gone now . [SEP]
[CLS] everything is fine . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they went through the payroll issues , but sir ##i ' s mind was stuck on malik and his parting words . [SEP]
[CLS] what did he mean about not being finished ? [SEP]
[CLS] did he mean that he was n ' t gone ? [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t matter if he decided that things were n ' t finished between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t some powerless college kid just hanging out waiting for her big shot boyfriend to sweep into town and pick her up . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a business woman with things to do , children to raise and . . . . oh no ! [SEP]
[CLS] what would malik do if he realized that jacob and samuel were his sons ? [SEP]
[CLS] had n ' t the paper mentioned something about him not being able to con ##ce ##ive with his first wife ? [SEP]
[CLS] what would he do if he realized he had a ready made heir already set to be trained ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to go , mary , ' ' sir ##i said quickly , fighting the panic that was threatening to over ##w ##helm her and left the office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wait , did you need me to sign anything ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , ' ' mary replied , pointing to the end of month payroll statement . [SEP]
[CLS] she pointed out several items that needed sir ##i ' s approval , explained a few other issues and then nodded when all was signed at the bottom , allowing the payroll to be di ##sb ##urse ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] normally they went through the statement more thoroughly , but sir ##i simply could n ' t focus on the numbers today . [SEP]
[CLS] not after malik ' s visit ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks mary . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m sorry i was so distracted today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no problem . [SEP]
[CLS] we can go over the details tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thanks , ' ' sir ##i said and rushed out of the building . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a little earlier than normal to pick up her boys , but not abnormal ##ly so . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes she would pick them up and just go to the park . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d do that today , just to spend some time with them , to make sure they were okay which was completely ridiculous except that she knew of the imminent threat to their compact little world . [SEP]
[CLS] the thought of malik finding out about them was so terrifying , she could n ' t even con ##ce ##ive of what would happen . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed heirs , and apparently , there was a great deal of pressure for him to marry immediately and have sons to carry on his legacy and the prosperity of malik ' s reign . [SEP]
[CLS] but the man did n ' t know that he already had two perfectly healthy children , who were absolutely wonderful and spirited and intelligent and . . . . no , she would n ' t allow them to be taken away from her . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d rejected them four years ago , he could just go have children with someone other female ! [SEP]
[CLS] let those kids be his heir , away from everything that was normal to them . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want her boys to have that kind of royal pressure and to have their future choices taken away from them at the tender age of three . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted them to be raised with hugs and kisses and the fear of asking out a girl for the first time , of football games and soccer and she might even torture them with piano lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] she automatically stopped at a red light and rested her head on the hard , un ##for ##giving steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] was she doing the right thing ? [SEP]
[CLS] if the roles were reversed , how would she feel if he hid her children from him ? [SEP]
[CLS] it did n ' t matter if it was a ridiculous argument , she knew exactly how she would feel if her children were hidden from her knowledge . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d be furious and liv ##id and would feel betrayed . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t do that to him . [SEP]
[CLS] hiding his sons ' existence was the wrong thing to do . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d rejected her letter , but how could he have known what was in the letter ? [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t use that weak argument any longer , it was n ' t fair . [SEP]
[CLS] especially after she ' d coldly rejected so many of his letters first and without wanting any explanation from him . [SEP]
[CLS] the issue was pointless anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] whether he had rejected the letter or not , there were certain moral issues that rose above petty rejection ##s or arguments of who rejected whom first . [SEP]
[CLS] it was his flesh and blood and he deserved to know the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d had no way of contact ##ing him before , but she could n ' t even pull that point off the charts now that he was here , in chicago and trying to see her . [SEP]
[CLS] a horn hon ##ked behind her and she jumped , looking around and trying to figure out where she was . [SEP]
[CLS] the light had turned green and she quickly accelerated through the intersection , making her way carefully to the preschool building without really thinking about the directions . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , she did n ' t cause an accident or get into one . [SEP]
[CLS] at least , she did n ' t think so . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , she was n ' t completely sure what was going on around her since thoughts of her boys being taken away from her so they could be trained to be royal beings rolled through her mind in a night ##mar ##ish table ##au of heartbreak and loneliness , of having no say in how her boys were raised once malik took them away from her . [SEP]
[CLS] she forced a smile as she passed by the classrooms , nodding as politely as possible to the teachers as she walked in , but inside , her heart was breaking . [SEP]
[CLS] this might be the last , normal night she ' d have with these little guys . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d call malik tonight and give him the news . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d probably want to meet them . [SEP]
[CLS] and she was sure her little boys would want to meet their father . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped and watched her guys through the window , smiling as they laughed about something only they could hear since the two of them were sitting next to each other , building again with their curly haired heads bent towards each other . [SEP]
[CLS] goodness , they loved building things , she thought with a heart full of love . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob looked up and glanced through the classroom observation window , his chu ##bby face breaking out into a huge smile when he spotted her . [SEP]
[CLS] he immediately ja ##bbed sam who repeated the process . [SEP]
[CLS] two peas in a pod , she thought and pushed away from the wall and walked in , loving their ex ##uber ##ant greeting as they both threw themselves into her arms , their strong little arms wrapping around her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , this was all worth all the frustration ##s of being a single mother of twins . [SEP]
[CLS] completely worth every moment ! [SEP]
[CLS] and , sadly , she could n ' t deny malik this happiness either . [SEP]
[CLS] they were rational , intelligent human beings . [SEP]
[CLS] between the two of them , they could figure out an e ##quitable compromise that would be good for the boys as well as for the other parties involved . [SEP]
[CLS] surely there was a way to work something out , she told herself with what little optimism she could muster . [SEP]
[CLS] surely there could be a sharing agreement set up . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost started crying at the idea of these two little fellows not being with her every night , safely tucked into their todd ##ler beds where she knew they were safe . [SEP]
[CLS] malik would keep them from harm , she was sure . [SEP]
[CLS] he might be a rat in the romance department , but these little guys represented the future of his country . [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t let anything happen to them . [SEP]
[CLS] she gathered their preschool bags , spoke briefly with their favorite teacher about the day , then walked them out to the car before tucking them up in their car seats for the short drive home . [SEP]
[CLS] she would call malik as soon as they were settled for the night , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] after they were tucked in , she would give him the news , they would talk , they would figure out how to move forward and arrange for a meeting with him and the boys . [SEP]
[CLS] he might not believe they were hers , she knew . [SEP]
[CLS] and if he rejected them , all the better . [SEP]
[CLS] she would then have done her part and tried to do the right thing . [SEP]
[CLS] if he tossed it back in her face , she would be ec ##static ##ally happy to have her sons all to herself once again . [SEP]
[CLS] when they walked into the house and both of them raced to the backyard , jumping up and down , begging her to let them play outside for just a little bit longer before dinner , she re ##lent ##ed with a sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] as she watched them roll around and play on their todd ##ler sized swing and slide , she picked up her cell phone , deciding to get the pain over with as quickly as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] since malik had called her earlier , she had his phone number in her cell phone . [SEP]
[CLS] she just had to press the re - dial button and she ' d be connected to him . [SEP]
[CLS] her finger shook as she pressed the button , wishing she could ignore what was right and just keep her precious boys all to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she listened carefully as malik ' s end rang once , twice , then went to voice mail . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t his voice , but a computer generated message that asked the caller to leave a message . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , this is sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] i . . . we . . . there ' s something you should know , ' ' she started off awkwardly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , we need to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to tell you something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath and closed her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m making a mess of this . [SEP]
[CLS] would you mind calling me back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she left her cell phone number , then felt silly since he already had her cell phone number , which was exactly why she had his number . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as he listened he would think she ' d become a complete , ram ##bling idiot ! [SEP]
[CLS] needing to end the horrible conversation quickly , she finished with , ` ` anyway , thanks and i look forward to hearing from you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pressed the end button , then tossed her phone into her purse , feeling ridiculous for sounding so ins ##ecure and tentative . [SEP]
[CLS] and why in the world had she said she was ' looking forward ' to hearing from him ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was dread ##ing the next time she heard his voice , wanting to toss the cell phone into the freeze ##r or oven just so she would n ' t be able to hear it when he called back . [SEP]
[CLS] then again , what was she supposed to say ? [SEP]
[CLS] ' would you mind stopping by at your convenience to meet your two sons ? [SEP]
[CLS] yes , they ' re twins , three years old and adorable . [SEP]
[CLS] no , you ca n ' t take them away from me either . ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i did n ' t really feel like that was the best way to break the news to an ex - boyfriend about his current father ##hood . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , she watched jacob as he climbed the ladder on the small play set she had set up in her fence ##d in back yard . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys loved that set , thought it was so wonderful but already they were growing too big for it . [SEP]
[CLS] sam slid down the two foot slide , laughing at the bottom as if it were a joke . [SEP]
[CLS] and then jacob slid down , right on top of sam causing both of them to laugh even harder . [SEP]
[CLS] they were large for their age , always had been . [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered the doctor ' s expression during each pre ##nat ##al visit when he charted their growth , impressed with how quickly they were growing in ut ##ero . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t such a surprise to sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew how large and tall malik was and her sons were showing every sign of taking after him in both bra ##wn and height . [SEP]
[CLS] as she watched them laughing and playing , their ram ##bu ##nc ##tious activities made her laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] she was supposed to be making dinner and settling down for the evening but she chuckled at their antics , not wanting to slow them down by bringing them inside when they were having so much fun . [SEP]
[CLS] what mother would n ' t want to keep these little ty ##kes in her life ? [SEP]
[CLS] knowing they would be fa ##mis ##hed after all this activity , she pulled herself together and looked around in her pantry to figure out what to make for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] she got out the pasta and whipped up their favorite meal of mac ##aro ##ni and cheese for dinner , adding in hot dogs which they loved , even if they did n ' t know the hot dogs were actually made out of to ##fu . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was finished , she called them inside and told them to go wash their hands . [SEP]
[CLS] when they were all cleaned up , they each climbed into their chairs and looked at the meal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mac and cheese ? [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s the special occasion ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked , already looking into the cass ##ero ##le dish to smell the che ##dda ##r cheese . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , billy gets the mac and cheese in the box but this is much better , ' ' he declared and jumped out of his chair to give her a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i accepted the hug with re ##lish , then picked him up and pl ##opped him back down into his chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s say grace , ' ' she ad ##mon ##ished before sam could grab the handle of the spoon to serve himself . [SEP]
[CLS] the warning was two ##fold . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted them to be grateful for their food , but she also knew that his little hand would dig the spoon in deep , and there was the strong possibility that he would fling some of the cass ##ero ##le onto the wall behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] experience had taught her well . [SEP]
[CLS] both boys bowed their heads while sir ##i gave thanks , then they licked their lips as she took the serving spoon and lad ##led the mac and cheese onto their plates . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` real hot dogs ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do they look real ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she questioned right back at them , surprised that they were asking . [SEP]
[CLS] they continuously surprised her about what they ' d figured out . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob laughed and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not real , ' ' he declared . [SEP]
[CLS] sam nodded his head and popped one into his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` to ##fu dogs , ' ' he claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we get real hot dogs at school . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i did n ' t correct him that they only served turkey hot dogs at school . [SEP]
[CLS] what they did n ' t know , would n ' t hurt them . [SEP]
[CLS] she kept checking her cell phone for messages , wondering if she ' d missed the call from malik . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past , she had n ' t bothered him unless she knew he was on his way to her . [SEP]
[CLS] so she was n ' t sure what time laps ##e was normal when she needed him to call her back . [SEP]
[CLS] bath time passed by , their teeth brushed , their cute little bodies tucked into flee ##ce pajamas and both of them snuggled into their beds in the room right across from hers . [SEP]
[CLS] and still no word from malik . [SEP]
[CLS] it was relatively early in the evening , only eight o ' clock , but she ' d called him two hours ago . [SEP]
[CLS] surely he ' d gotten the message by now . [SEP]
[CLS] a small part of her hoped that the phone he had used earlier in the day to call her was n ' t really his . [SEP]
[CLS] that it was just a throw away that he used sometimes when he needed a phone . [SEP]
[CLS] that would let her off the hook and she could keep her boys all to herself , guilt free . [SEP]
[CLS] the dishes were finally done , the cozy kitchen cleaned up and her family room all straightened out by the time she sat down and pulled her work bag towards her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was propped up on her overs ##tu ##ffed chair , and it occurred to her that this was almost the same position she was in when malik had walked into her apartment four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] her tiny little cottage style house was bigger , but not by much . [SEP]
[CLS] the family room contained barely enough space for her sofa and two chairs , but this furniture was of much better quality than what she ' d had back then . [SEP]
[CLS] and this time around , she had a wall separating the kitchen from her family room , which was extremely nice . [SEP]
[CLS] it was funny how things changed , and yet they still remained ex ##cr ##uc ##iating ##ly familiar . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 4 she was concentrating on rec ##on ##ci ##ling the current inventory with the recent shipments when a hard , loud knock sounded on her front door . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up with worried eyes and noticed that it was only eight thirty , but she could n ' t imagine who would be at her door even at this time of the night . [SEP]
[CLS] her neighbors were wonderful , but they also knew that her boys went to sleep early at night , and they would definitely call before stopping by for any reason . [SEP]
[CLS] she peered warily through the security pee ##p hole and her nervous breath caught in her throat . [SEP]
[CLS] standing on her front st ##oop , looking exceptionally gorgeous , was malik in a pair of perfectly pressed , casual slacks and a sexy , leather jacket . [SEP]
[CLS] with a deep breath , she opened the door slowly , wishing she could just ignore him completely and keep her children to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] do the right thing , she told herself stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you would call me back , ' ' she said in lieu of a greeting as she leaned against her front door as if it could somehow protect her from the impact this man continued to have on her . [SEP]
[CLS] an impact she resented now and wished she could ban ##ish from her life . [SEP]
[CLS] he put a hand to her door and gently pressed the door open wider . [SEP]
[CLS] once he was inside , he closed the door himself , looking at her with desire in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t want to wait . [SEP]
[CLS] i got your message and came over . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly retreated behind one of the large chairs , a new defense that she also realized was weak as he came closer and she could smell his subtle , spicy after ##sha ##ve . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how did you know where i lived ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked nervously , wishing her voice was stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] but he was looking at her as if he wanted to . . . . well , taste her , she thought as she watched his eyes look at her trembling mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved slowly around the chair , never taking his eyes from his prey as he relentless ##ly stalked her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` same resources that found your cell phone earlier . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped back and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i really do n ' t like those resources . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stepped closer , his tall body crowd ##ing her and she stepped back , wanting space from the heat em ##ana ##ting from his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re good resources . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re nos ##y resources that have invaded my privacy , ' ' she said but this came out as a whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes moved over him , noting his strong jaw , shoulders that were imp ##oss ##ibly broad and muscled and a chest that tape ##red to slim hips and long , powerful legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re beautiful , ' ' he said and this time he was less than an inch from her . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand came up , a finger gently caressing her cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going t kiss you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t , ' ' she cr ##oa ##ked out . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to turn her head , but his finger stopped her , somehow holding her still while his head slowly , ever so slowly descended towards hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i can stop myself , ' ' he replied and covered her mouth with his . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and his tongue took full advantage of the possibility , moving inside , tasting her , teasing her to participate in the kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried for all of two seconds to resist . [SEP]
[CLS] but those feelings that had been there four years ago were actually more powerful now . [SEP]
[CLS] he was more powerful , his ability to lure her in complete . [SEP]
[CLS] she wished she were stronger , and then she did n ' t wish for anything except having his arms around her , his body pressing against hers the way he used to do for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him too desperately for anything intelligent to contra ##dict . [SEP]
[CLS] with a moan , she wrapped her arms around his neck , her hands gripping his shoulders to pull him closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly complied , his hands moving from her head down her body , ski ##mming against her back and her waist to re ##ac ##qua ##int himself with her once again . [SEP]
[CLS] and she loved it , rev ##ele ##d in his touch and his scent and the way he felt against her . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been four years since any man had touched her like this and , truth be told , he was the only one who had ever tempted her to want this . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted her up and pressed her against him , his hands taking control but sir ##i needed no prompting . [SEP]
[CLS] her legs automatically wrapped around his waist and she pressed against him , wishing their clothing was n ' t in the way . [SEP]
[CLS] next thing she knew , she was falling but his arms were still securely holding her . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt the mattress underneath her back , she almost sighed with relief , but that ' s when he lifted himself up slightly and pulled her sweater over her head , his heated gaze looking at her with the red , lace bra . [SEP]
[CLS] she held her breath , praying that he would n ' t just look but she should n ' t have worried because his hand smoothed up her stomach , cupping her right breast in his long , strong fingers , his thumb rubbing the already taut nipple and making her body flinch with the need to feel him , her legs pulling him closer and her arms reaching for him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed the jacket off his shoulders , then started working on the buttons of his shirt , but she could n ' t make them open fast enough . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , he stood up and un ##bu ##tton ##ed the top two buttons , then simply pulled the dress shirt over his head , tossing it behind him before coming back . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand and pressed her palm against his stomach and sir ##i did n ' t need any other invitation . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers had always loved to touch him , to feel his heated skin underneath her fingertips . [SEP]
[CLS] he inhaled sharply when her fingers moved lower , running along the top edge of his slacks , slipping underneath before coming back out and working on his belt buckle . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabbed both of her hands , pulling them out to the sides as he bent to take her nipple in his mouth , sucking hard before gen ##tling , then circling the hard peak with his tongue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take it off , ' ' she gasped , begging him with both the words and her body to move the bra out of the way . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want anything between his tongue and her breast , needing all of him like she ' d never needed anyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` with pleasure , ' ' he said with a husky laugh and his hands quickly un ##lat ##ched the snap and pulled off the red lace , tossing it behind him before bringing his head back down to suck ##le her again , pulling her nipple into his mouth until she cried out for relief . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is this all you are going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , taunting him with words since he was still holding her hands out to the sides . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t move and could n ' t make him go faster . [SEP]
[CLS] she was trapped and wanted him inside her so desperately she was writhing on the bed , her legs rubbing against his side in an attempt to push him over the edge so he would take her , make her whole like he ' d done in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her and she could see that he was working hard to restrain himself , to go slower for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` take your time later , ' ' she begged , licking her lips in desperate need . [SEP]
[CLS] he watched her and tried for control , but when she arched against him , pressing herself against his erection and showing him that she was ready for him , he did n ' t want to hold back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please malik , i ' m already begging ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tried for a moment longer , but when she pressed against him again , he cursed under his breath and stood up , releasing her hands and stepping back so he could take off his slacks . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i did n ' t hesitate either . [SEP]
[CLS] she sat up and slid her own slacks off , too far gone by this point for any sort of common sense to enter into the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed him , he was here and he wanted her . [SEP]
[CLS] those were the only things she understood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' he groaned when he came back to her , pressing her back against the mattress and pulling her legs back against his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] he reached down , his fingers seeking the soft folds and finding her more than ready for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve missed you so much ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said a moment before he pushed himself into her , pulling one of her legs over his shoulder so he could go deeper , press her harder . [SEP]
[CLS] as he moved inside her , sir ##i rev ##ele ##d in how wonderful it felt , how whole and perfect he felt . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated the fact but she ' d never wanted this from any other man . [SEP]
[CLS] and then he sped up and her thoughts flew out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] she desperately needed . . . . she reached up and held on , knowing that he ' d never let her down and arched into his thrusts . [SEP]
[CLS] just when she did n ' t think she could take anymore , he reached down , his fingers pressing against her and she splinter ##ed outward , every cell in her body exploding with pleasure so intense she was n ' t sure if she cried out or simply cried . [SEP]
[CLS] she just hung onto his strong body , her whole self becoming a part of him in those moments . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a long time , but finally she was able to open her eyes and look around . [SEP]
[CLS] what she saw made her blush and wish she could pull back . [SEP]
[CLS] but malik had never allowed her any shy ##ness before and he had n ' t changed in the past four years . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do that , ' ' he said softly , his head dipping down to ni ##bble along her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying to pull out from underneath him but he was n ' t having any of that . [SEP]
[CLS] he simply shifted his weight to the side and pulled her next to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know exactly what , ' ' he replied and moved lower . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be back , ' ' he said and pulled himself away from her , moving to the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard the water running and tried to pull the blanket from the bottom of the bed over her , but he was too fast . [SEP]
[CLS] he was already st ##riding back to the bed before she had a chance to even un ##fold the soft material . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told you not to do that , ' ' he said with a chuckle and whipped the fabric out of her reach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mentioned something earlier about going slower , ' ' he said as his head dipped down . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i knew he was going to kiss her and she turned her face to the side to avoid that . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to stop him , they had to talk but when denied her mouth , he simply took whatever was available . [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment , it happened to be her breast which was already sensitive from his previous love ##making . [SEP]
[CLS] when he touched her , she almost sat up in the bed because the feeling was so intense . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled and moved to the other breast , giving it the same attention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not getting away from me , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to enjoy it this time . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to move out from underneath him , but at the same time , bringing his head down for more attention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you saying you did n ' t enjoy the last go around ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t going to take this laying down , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] just as much as he ' d learned about her body , she had been taught what he liked . [SEP]
[CLS] and she fought the intensity of his touch the only way she knew how ; by giving as good as she got . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers slid down his back , moving back up and then down the front of his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted himself a bit higher so she could have better access and sir ##i took advantage of that . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands moved down his chest , switching from light , flutter ##y movements to a more firm touch that told him she meant business . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a random path her hands made , until she reached her goal . [SEP]
[CLS] as her fingers moved downward , she smiled as she grasped him and heard his sharp intake of breath . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down and watched as her hands smoothed , explored . [SEP]
[CLS] when she pressed against him , even the light ##est pressure and he was on his back and she smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] this was pay ##back time , she thought as her mouth followed the same path her fingers had just traveled while her hands continued to caress his erection , re ##ac ##qua ##int ##ing herself with his size and length . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the satin ##y feel of him , the amazing texture and mu ##sky , male scent as she kissed and tasted his ridge ##d stomach muscles . [SEP]
[CLS] as she moved lower , she could feel his body tense in anticipation and she almost laughed , joy ##ous at the power she had over him at this moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she continued to kiss him , her body moving against his legs and she felt his hands in her hair , his fingers mass ##aging her scalp and his whole body went almost rigid with expectation when her mouth hovered over him , not moving , teasing him with her warm breath . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally took him in her mouth , she was thrilled with his groan of pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth covered him , taking as much of him as she could . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved against him , her tongue teasing as she pleasure ##d him the best way she knew . [SEP]
[CLS] he only gave her a few moments of that before he sat up , picked her up and literally lifted her over him so she was flat on her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` two can play at that game , ' ' he growled before he ni ##bbled his way down her body . [SEP]
[CLS] his large chest was in the way so she had no defense when his hot mouth covered her core . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t as tentative as she was either . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew what he was about and was relentless as he played her body like a violin , listening to her gasps and moans , feeling the tension in her muscles but not letting her have the release she needed . [SEP]
[CLS] each time she came close , he ' d bring her down , then ramp her up again until she was begging him once again . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i could n ' t believe how well he could control her , how intense he could make her feel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' she cried out , her fingers in his hair and her body arched against his mouth in a desperate attempt to find the release . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re so beautiful , ' ' he said before he flicked his tongue , his fingers moving against her and letting her climax while he watched with fascination . [SEP]
[CLS] when she relaxed against the mattress once again , he lifted himself up , looking down at her and she glared back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did that on purpose ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed , trying to be angry , but not sure she had the energy to get to that emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i did . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' m going to do it again , ' ' he said with a low , powerful tone of voice . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shook her head , not sure she could handle another wave like the previous two . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , please , no . . . ' ' she started to say then he slid into her warmth and she sighed with how good he felt , how stretched and full she felt now . [SEP]
[CLS] and how ready she was , once again , to experience this man ' s magic . [SEP]
[CLS] as he moved inside her , she found that she was more than ready to take all of him , to ride the intense wave of pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] her body was so prime ##d , so ready she could barely even think or breathe as he took her higher , faster , pounding into her and not giving in until she cried out with her climax . [SEP]
[CLS] he followed moments later , holding her close as he too experienced the same feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] a long time later , he slid out of her and went to the bathroom once again to clean up . [SEP]
[CLS] as she watched him go , she felt both cher ##ished and respected that he ' d had the fore ##sight to use protection . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , she had n ' t been prepared and was sincerely grateful that he had been . [SEP]
[CLS] which raised the question of why he was so prepared , she thought as she rolled to her side , pulling the blanket over herself . [SEP]
[CLS] this time he allowed it and she marvel ##ed at how sexy he looked when he came out of the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned against the door frame , looking at her in the bed and she shivered , knowing that he was thinking about round three . [SEP]
[CLS] that man did n ' t really slow down , she knew from experience . [SEP]
[CLS] even when she thought her body was completely sat ##ed and there was no way he could get her going again , a touch or a look and she was once again prime ##d and ready for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need a drink of water , ' ' sir ##i said , her voice hoarse and her body not able to move easily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll get you something , ' ' he said and pushed away from the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] but she stopped him with a touch to his bare shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t know where anything is , ' ' she said and slipped out of the bed , pulling her robe over her before she stood up and belt ##ed it closed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you think that ' s going to stop me when you come back , you need to re - evaluate your methods , ' ' he said and walked to stand in front of her , his hands resting on her slender hips , already moving up and down against the soft fabric of her robe . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , about what just happened . . . we ca n ' t do this , ' ' she said awkwardly , wanting to step away from him but he just smelled so good . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was sending mixed message ##d which was n ' t fair . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir ##i , we just did ' this ' . [SEP]
[CLS] and we ' re going to do it again and again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' she said and pushed her hair behind her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] i need to . . . ' ' ` ` i know what you said on the message . [SEP]
[CLS] that you needed to talk . [SEP]
[CLS] but it seems as if we have trouble talking right now . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t you go get some water and we ' ll try to talk a bit later . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , we need to talk outside of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] now . [SEP]
[CLS] i mentioned on the message that i needed to tell you something important . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir ##i , right now , i ' m honestly having trouble letting you leave just to get a glass of water . [SEP]
[CLS] do you truly think that not having a bed in our vicinity is going to keep my hands off of you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused and sighed , shaking his head as he said , ` ` you ' re even more beautiful now than you were four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s something about you that ' s more all ##uring , more . . . ' ' he looked her up and down , his dark eyes taking in her larger breasts , her hips that were round ##er , sex ##ier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t really know what it is , but i ca n ' t get enough of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped back and opened the bedroom door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be back , ' ' she said , her mind frantically trying to figure out how to tell him about jacob and samuel , needing to give him the news but each time she tried , he changed the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we really have to talk , malik . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a mistake , you have to leave . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to be firm , but could n ' t look at him while she said the words . [SEP]
[CLS] he was reaching for his slacks as he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was n ' t a mistake , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] i can explain what happened four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] just go get your water and we ' ll talk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i sighed because he was n ' t moving quickly to get dressed or meet her in another room . [SEP]
[CLS] he should have looked ridiculous standing there in her bedroom with all the flowers and delicate items , but the decor only showed off how truly masculine he was . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so confident in that mas ##cu ##lini ##ty that the flowers did n ' t even bother him . [SEP]
[CLS] she doubted he preferred the decor , but it did n ' t make him cr ##inge . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d give him points for that , she thought as she walked out of her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t really need water , although she went into her small kitchen and reached for a large glass in the cabinet anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] she really just needed some space to try and figure out how to tell malik about his sons , to find the right words that would give him the news without creating any hurt or resentment . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i leaned against the counter , staring into the darkness outside her window . [SEP]
[CLS] how should she start off the conversation ? [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t just come out and say it . [SEP]
[CLS] this was something that probably needed a bit of an explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] but if she explained , then he might explain why he ' d left her that weekend to marry the other woman . [SEP]
[CLS] she really did n ' t want to hear his explanations . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t imagine any reason she ' d like that would excuse that kind of a betrayal . [SEP]
[CLS] now that she thought about it , maybe it was n ' t such a big deal . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d gone off and married a woman that was more appropriate to his station in life . [SEP]
[CLS] a woman that was probably politically connected and therefore more suitable . [SEP]
[CLS] the man had an image to uphold and she had no illusions about her appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] she was just an ordinary working woman and at , the time , she had n ' t even finished school . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman he ' d married had been beautiful and confident , poised and sophisticated . [SEP]
[CLS] she had probably been a much bigger help to his rule than she could ever be . [SEP]
[CLS] four years ago , she had been emotionally invested in the relationship , but obviously malik had thought she was just a weekend fling , the kind of woman who was available whenever he was with no strings attached . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had been the only part of the relationship that had n ' t understood the rules . [SEP]
[CLS] that thought hurt and she turned around , her mind spinning with the possibilities of how to tell him her news and none of them were a good start to how she was to explain that malik had two wonderful , intelligent sons . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , she shook her head and bit her lip in frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] she was pro ##cr ##ast ##inating and she needed to get back there to her bedroom , tell him to get dressed and bring him back out to the living room where she could have a conversation with him without the distraction of her bed . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i opened the fridge and . . . . screamed at the top of her lungs ! [SEP]
[CLS] in the darkness , all she saw were little things jumping out . [SEP]
[CLS] everywhere ! [SEP]
[CLS] b ##lo ##bs were jumping from the top shelf of the fridge , the bottom shelf , seemed to be crawling out of the drawers and on the con ##diment jars . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the b ##lo ##bs jumped towards her and she screamed again , unsure of what was going on and trying to figure it out in her sex and nighttime mud ##dled brain . [SEP]
[CLS] when one of the b ##lo ##bs came closer , she jumped up onto the kitchen table and pulled her feet up , sc ##ree ##ching as the jumping things , which now looked like larger and faster b ##lo ##bs , were bouncing and crawling all over her kitchen floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she was just about to scream again when the overhead light flipped on and her body was picked up and slammed between malik ' s hard , muscular back and the wall of her kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] adding to the chaos , jacob in his red flee ##ce pajamas and sam in his blue ones , came rushing out to the kitchen , their curly hair messed up and their tiny little eyes blinking in the bright light of the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t hurt them ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam screamed and immediately bent down to protect his treasures , which sir ##i now realized were dozens of little frogs , all of whom , she suspected , had been stored in her fridge in the shoe box that was laying open on the top shelf . [SEP]
[CLS] her only two clues were the fact that she never , ever kept shoe boxes in her fridge and she could n ' t fat ##hom any reason to poke holes in a shoe box , except if one , or two little boys , wanted to keep something alive in said shoe box . [SEP]
[CLS] she relaxed for all of two seconds before the adrenaline that had been co ##urs ##ing through her body reacted to the release of the fear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` samuel martin ! [SEP]
[CLS] are you telling me that you stored your frogs in my refrigerator ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed malik out of the way and came to stand in front of him , hands on her hips as she glared down at her son who was carefully scoop ##ing up his frogs and gently putting them back into the shoe box he ' d had them in previously . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob came to his brother ' s defense , but he was also delighted by the middle of the night spectacle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they like the cold , momma . [SEP]
[CLS] they were too warm outside so i had to do something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please explain to me why you thought my fridge was the something that you came up with . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , jacob was no longer looking at all the frogs jumping around . [SEP]
[CLS] he was entrance ##d by the sight behind her and , adorable , brave little guy that he was , he knew there was an imminent threat to his precious mother and he was determined to rise to her rescue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t hurt my momma ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he yelled out , adding a whole new dimension to the chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] his chu ##bby little hands were fisted at his sides and he was in obvious fighting mode with a clear line of sight to malik . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob , ' ' she started to say , only to turn around and glance at malik . [SEP]
[CLS] all she saw was a completely naked man with a knife in his hand , staring at two little boys with a stunned expression on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t just stand there , malik , go put some clothes on ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her , then back at the boys , then down at himself . [SEP]
[CLS] something must have gotten through because he looked back at the boys and nodded curt ##ly before moving off to the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] while bending down to try and catch the disgusting , jumping b ##lo ##bs , she glanced up at her son , trying to figure out why he was n ' t bending down to help . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he was glaring at the door where the strange man had disappeared , obviously trying to figure out why the stranger had gone into his mother ' s room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob , stop it ! [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not going to fight that man so stop acting bell ##iger ##ent and help me catch these horrible creatures , ' ' she commanded in as gentle a voice as possible under the circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob did n ' t obey , but instead followed malik with his eyes , glaring daggers at the naked man who , in his mind , was a threat to his mother , the only security he knew in his little world . [SEP]
[CLS] when malik was gone , jacob put his arm around sir ##i ' s shoulders and patted her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s okay , momma . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s gone now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i would have laughed at how cute her little man was , how proud he was to have protected his mother , but she was still frantically trying to get the frogs back into the box . [SEP]
[CLS] they really had n ' t enjoyed being in the box which had been in the cold fridge and now they were not cooper ##ating when she and sam tried to get them back into their ' jail ' . [SEP]
[CLS] nor would she , sir ##i thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t like being put back into the fridge , so she ' d be trying to pop out of any box that might go back into cold storage too . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob , please help me , ' ' she groaned as she picked up yet another one and dumped it into the box . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not like that momma . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to be gentle , ' ' sam explained as he carefully caught one and put it in the box . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the sp ##ry little devil just shot back up again . [SEP]
[CLS] malik reappeared , dressed in his slacks and shirt once again . [SEP]
[CLS] with efficient hands , he picked up several that were escaping into her living room , and captured three more in his path to the box . [SEP]
[CLS] he then dumped them all inside and covered it while he found the others . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that all there is ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , looking stern ##ly at sam . [SEP]
[CLS] sam looked up at the big man and nodded , his mouth hanging open as he realized that someone was in his kitchen that might not be as nice as his mother . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh of relief , sir ##i picked up the box , careful not to drop it even though the disgusting things were still popping around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , these are going outside and i do n ' t ever want to see any kind of creature in my fridge , ever again . [SEP]
[CLS] do you understand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but momma , they needed . . . ' ' she immediately sliced the air with her hand , cutting off any explanation he might have . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a non - ne ##go ##tia ##ble issue in her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] the fridge is not to keep anything cool other than food . [SEP]
[CLS] no excuses and no getting around that rule . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed , realizing the no - getting - around - mom tone of voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , momma . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and jacob , stop glaring . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s almost midnight . [SEP]
[CLS] both of you need to get back into bed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is he leaving ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob asked , still glaring at malik despite sir ##i ' s ad ##mon ##ition for him to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] but he and i have some things to talk about . [SEP]
[CLS] the sooner both of you are in bed and asleep , the sooner he will leave . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shuffled both of them off to their room , tucked them in and gave each of them a soft kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go to sleep , ' ' she ordered gently . [SEP]
[CLS] since they ' d never been up this late , she was n ' t sure if they were too wound up to fall back to sleep , or if they would fall to sleep immediately now that things were quiet once again . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned and found malik standing in the doorway , his arms crossed over his chest as he looked down at the boys in their identical todd ##ler beds . [SEP]
[CLS] without a word , she followed him out to her living room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you give me just a moment to pull on some clothes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 5 malik could only nod and he watched with rising fury as she walked down the hallway , closing the door behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] as if that would stop him , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t believe that she ' d kept something like this from him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had children ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d loved another man ? [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t sure about the age of those little boys , but they had to be about three or four years old . [SEP]
[CLS] so she ' d met someone almost immediately after he ' d left . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t waited around very long , had she ? [SEP]
[CLS] had he been wrong about their relationship ? [SEP]
[CLS] he would have sworn that she ' d loved him all those years ago but maybe he ' d only been hoping that were the case . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d obviously moved on after he ' d left . [SEP]
[CLS] and to think , for four years , he ' d felt guilty about the way things had ended , had tried hard to contact her again in order to explain things and try to make her understand why he ' d married his ex - wife . [SEP]
[CLS] when she came back out , he was pacing the tiny expanse of her living room , so beside himself with rage that he was actually ready to kick the furniture out of his way to make more room . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched him carefully for a moment , realizing he was ang ##rier than she ' d ever seen him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so now you know , ' ' she said and sat down on the chair , her hands on her knees as she braced for the questions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how long ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was n ' t sure what he was asking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how long before they were born ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , fine ! [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s as good a start as anything else . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they were born march twelfth , just over three years ago . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly did the math and almost exploded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so were you with someone while you were with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , bending down and leaning over her so she had to push back against the cushions . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him , confused . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ! [SEP]
[CLS] you should excuse yourself ! [SEP]
[CLS] how dare you be with some other man while you and i were . . . ' ' ` ` some other man ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she interrupted , her temper starting to increase as she absorbed the accusation he was tossing at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , are you saying that i cheated on you with someone else ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed him back by his shoulders , standing up and glaring right back at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to say that you waited until after i left ? [SEP]
[CLS] how long ? [SEP]
[CLS] maybe a week ? [SEP]
[CLS] if that ? [SEP]
[CLS] those boys are too young for you to have had much time in between me and the next guy you slept with . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how dare you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she poked him in the stomach , wanting to hit him but trying to be nice despite the disgusting accusations he was making . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never been with any other man but you , but now i ' m wondering why i even bothered . [SEP]
[CLS] how could you even think something like that about me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because . . . ' ' he gestured behind him to where the boys were sleeping . [SEP]
[CLS] and then he hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] she was spitting mad and waited for the information to sink in . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped when the realization dawned on him that those were his sons asleep in the other room . [SEP]
[CLS] she noticed the tension in his shoulders fall off and his whole body almost dr ##ooped into the chair behind him with the understanding that he was their father . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to bank her temper now that he was getting a better understanding of the situation , but it was hard . [SEP]
[CLS] this was just another slap in the face after all she ' d gone through previously with , and without , this man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` those are your sons in that room , the same ones who were about to fight you in my kitchen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed breathless and all the anger was gone . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head , trying to wrap his mind around the news . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t know . . . ' ' ` ` of course you did n ' t know . [SEP]
[CLS] because you rejected my letter when i tried to tell you , ' ' she said and reached behind her to the large desk filled with all her important papers . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled out the well worn envelope , still sealed with the post ##mark date and the ` ` return to send ##er ' ' stamped on the outside . [SEP]
[CLS] malik looked down at the envelope , then back up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] when his fingers moved to un ##sea ##l the envelope , sir ##i ' s stomach twisted with the memory of what she ' d written . [SEP]
[CLS] there had been no emotion left which would have enabled her to give him any details other than the per ##tine ##nt ones like a due date , the schedule and any additional information the doctor had provided to her . [SEP]
[CLS] the opening words had been simple , ` ` i ' m pregnant with our child . [SEP]
[CLS] if you ' d like to be a part of this child ' s life , please contact me through our lawyers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and then she ' d given the name of her father ' s attorney and his contact information . [SEP]
[CLS] a simple signature , no greeting or sal ##utation , a few facts about the pregnancy and that was it . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been too sick , both physically and emotionally to write anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] when the letter had been returned , the attorney had advised that she store it in a safe place , for just such a moment like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t get this , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] glancing at the date , he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they never would have sent this to me . [SEP]
[CLS] not during this time period . [SEP]
[CLS] things in dub ##an were . . . . chaotic . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t care about his minions and how they ' d harmed her and her life . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , she crossed her arms over her chest and watched him , waiting for his next move . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what you wanted to talk about tonight , ' ' he said and shifted uncomfortably on the sofa , his hands still holding the letter and envelope as he absorbed all of the news . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to talk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , so we ' re talking . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i took a seat as well and curled her legs underneath her . [SEP]
[CLS] trying to be fair , she considered the situation from his perspective and knew that she might have jumped to the same conclusion . [SEP]
[CLS] it was yet another reason they should n ' t become intimate since their trust in each other was completely destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re really wonderful boys , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] the anger was gone now , and all that was left was her joy in her sons . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are painfully smart , well ahead of their class in school . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are their names ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` jacob and samuel . [SEP]
[CLS] i picked those names because they sounded strong and tough . [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t want anyone messing with my kids . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded and looked at the wall , seeing their baby pictures framed and hung with pride . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what were they like as babies ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she told him about their birth and what they were like , described their personalities and their accomplishments . [SEP]
[CLS] malik continued to listen , asking questions and only pausing for a moment to make a ter ##se phone call . [SEP]
[CLS] it must have been to his driver who was outside her house waiting because he spoke rapidly in arabic , then snapped the phone shut , turning back to her for more questions . [SEP]
[CLS] for the next several hours , malik asked questions and she answered them , not holding anything back as she talked about her favorite subject . [SEP]
[CLS] she told him funny stories about their antics , pulled out their baby books and showed him photos . [SEP]
[CLS] they sat on the sofa together and she caught him up on their sons ' lives . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know when it happened , but at some point , she fell asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] she woke up the next morning with jacob and sam playing ` ` softly ' ' beside her bed . [SEP]
[CLS] they were trying to be quiet , but each one was building something with lego ##s , and it was a little hard to be quiet when arguing about who got which piece of the lego ##s set . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mom ' s awake , ' ' jacob whispered to sam . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m awake , ' ' she replied , pushing her hair out of her eyes and looking for malik . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s gone , momma . [SEP]
[CLS] he left a note . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam picked up the piece of paper beside him and handed it to her , all without looking away from his lego ##s bridge which he was trying to figure out how to make longer without making it taller as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it says he ' ll be back with breakfast . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked at the note and read the words . [SEP]
[CLS] simple and to the point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be back with breakfast . [SEP]
[CLS] m . ' ' she looked down at her son , eyebrows raised and her head spinning with both fatigue and surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam , did you read this note ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled his concentration away from the bridge and looked up at his mother with a confused expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` was i not supposed to ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shook her head , dumb ##founded that her three year old son was reading already . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when did you learn your letters ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked back down at his bridge , shrug ##ging his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we figured those out last month , momma , ' ' jacob replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ms . ten ##nl ##ey kept spelling things and it was irritating . [SEP]
[CLS] so we decided to figure out what she was spelling . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob looked up from his building , his eyes puzzled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what does ' inc ##ess ##ant ' mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i laughed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` never ending , ' ' she explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m guessing that you were asking her questions , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged and went back to his building . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sam asked more , ' ' he replied in his defense but he did n ' t seem overly concerned about being curious and asking multiple questions . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i rested her head in her hand for a moment , over ##aw ##ed once again by their intelligence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to shower . [SEP]
[CLS] can you two behave while i get dressed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , but what ' s for breakfast ? [SEP]
[CLS] and are n ' t we going to be late for school ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced at her clock and sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think we need to skip school today , ' ' she said and picked up the phone to let their school know they would n ' t be in today . [SEP]
[CLS] she suspected that malik would want to spend some time with them and she did n ' t blame him . [SEP]
[CLS] as she walked into the bathroom , she told herself that she was n ' t jealous of her sons ' day ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to spend time with malik , she needed to get some work done and he was off limits to her anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] as she showered , she felt her whole body tingle with awareness . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always felt this way when she knew that malik was going to be back and she shook her head , refusing to become excited , both emotionally and physically , just because the guy was coming to see their sons . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to be firm , to stay away from him and not fall back into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] if she just kept herself an arm ' s length away , she should be safe . [SEP]
[CLS] she added a bit more makeup , telling herself it was only because she looked so tired and was n ' t because she wanted to impress malik . [SEP]
[CLS] he was nothing but the father to her sons and if she wanted to keep her children here with her , and not in some foreign country , she had to be firm . [SEP]
[CLS] no charm , no kissing , no making love ever again . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked out to the kitchen , needing coffee pretty desperately at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked out the window as she filled up the coffee pot with water , intending to make double what she would normally brew since malik would probably need some as well . [SEP]
[CLS] as she looked at her yard , her mind wondered where those frogs had hopped off to during the night . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed softly , thinking about sam ' s expression when he saw all of his little treasures hopping around the kitchen and his sad little face when she put them outside instead of ' safely ' back in the fridge . [SEP]
[CLS] something to the right caught her eye and she focused her attention . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did n ' t see anything again , she relaxed and assumed she was just seeing things because she was so tired . [SEP]
[CLS] then she caught another movement , this time on the opposite side of her fence . [SEP]
[CLS] was it a cat ? [SEP]
[CLS] no , that was definitely too large to be a cat ! [SEP]
[CLS] as she watched , she saw a man standing on the corner of her yard . [SEP]
[CLS] picking up the phone , she scrambled to find the on button , frantically trying to call the police . [SEP]
[CLS] someone was in her back yard and they were n ' t from this neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew all the neighbors and large men with dark suits were not neighbor ##ly ! [SEP]
[CLS] the doorbell rang at the same time she found the on button but she ran to the door , thinking that maybe it was malik and he was in danger . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , as soon as she peered through the pee ##p hole , she saw him standing there . [SEP]
[CLS] she whipped open the door and grabbed him by the middle of his shirt , then slammed the door shut behind him , leaning against it as she tried to dial , but her fingers were shaking so badly she could n ' t find the numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik demanded , putting a hand to her phone and stopping her fingers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` someone . . . ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to speak but she was too terrified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` out back ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to push his hand away but he stopped her by grabbing her wrists . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you telling me that there ' s someone in the back yard ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he clarified . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded frantically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] two men , i think . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re big . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t know them . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to call the police . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was already shaking his head before she finished her statement , putting a reassuring hand over her own that were trying to dial the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` relax , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] those are my body guards . [SEP]
[CLS] or at least part of the team . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are they in my back yard ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were n ' t here ! [SEP]
[CLS] they should be with you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was already shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir ##i , as soon as i realized that my sons were in this house , i had my team split up and surround the house . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve been here all night long . [SEP]
[CLS] you heard me make the call last night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped trying to press the buttons and looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` security ? [SEP]
[CLS] body guards ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , trying to understand what he was telling her but the meaning of his words escaped her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but why are they here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he tried to be reassuring , but firm . [SEP]
[CLS] having his children guarded was a non - ne ##go ##tia ##ble issue . [SEP]
[CLS] and he would n ' t allow her to be in danger either . [SEP]
[CLS] she was going to be his wife , she just did n ' t know it yet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys ca n ' t be without body guards ever again . [SEP]
[CLS] nor can you , actually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stood there , staring at him for a long moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she really did n ' t like where her thoughts were leading her at his statement . [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one of them will be my heir , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] you had to know that this would happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was shaking her head and backing up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t do that to them ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s the natural order of things , ' ' he said , trying to calm her down . [SEP]
[CLS] she backed up , forgetting about the cell phone in her hands when he was telling her that one of her sons would be his heir while the other would be left behind , super ##fl ##uous unless the first born died . [SEP]
[CLS] the possibility was horrible and di ##vis ##ive to her children . [SEP]
[CLS] they were great friends and raising them in this way would tear that bond apart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then stop the order ! [SEP]
[CLS] change it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even want them being rulers , much less one of them being malik ' s heir . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d known it was a possibility , but now with the reality of the future being shoved down her throat , she did n ' t like it one little bit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re my sons . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ll need to come back to dub ##an and learn to rule the country . [SEP]
[CLS] my people will demand it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then tell them no ! [SEP]
[CLS] they are n ' t going anywhere . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped back , refusing the re ##ass ##urance of his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' re in charge , then make them find someone else to rule when you ' re . . . . ' ' she could n ' t say ' dead ' or ' gone ' or anything else that might force her to face this man ' s mortality . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and bowed his head , then raised it once again to look directly at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll also have to marry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and stepped backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` marry ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re the mother of my children . [SEP]
[CLS] we have to marry . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said it like the marriage was a fore ##gon ##e conclusion . [SEP]
[CLS] in her mind , it was far from her future . [SEP]
[CLS] not even a remote possibility ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you married some other woman ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked him up and down with disgust and frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not only that , you married her days after . . . . . sleeping with me ! [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t marry you now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re tired from last night and probably not thinking clearly . [SEP]
[CLS] i should n ' t have kept you up talking so long but let ' s just put this issue aside until we can think more clearly about this . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i pulled herself together . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can talk all you want . [SEP]
[CLS] but you ' re not taking my sons from me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re my sons as well , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you apparently have their whole future planned out for them . [SEP]
[CLS] well , one at least . [SEP]
[CLS] the other we can toss to the side , ' ' she said angrily and stormed into her kitchen , pressing the button to make the coffee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she inter ##jected after a moment ' s pause . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t toss him out , can we ? [SEP]
[CLS] an heir and a spare , is n ' t that the phrase ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t be ridiculous . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t consider either of them in that way and you know it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` momma , what ' s a spare ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked as he climbed up into his chair , looking at malik as if he were an esteem ##ed stranger . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d helped with his frogs so in sam ' s opinion , the tall man could n ' t be all bad , the todd ##ler sur ##mise ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob was right behind him and both looked up at her with curiosity , waiting for a response . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i sighed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were just arguing about politics , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] are you hungry ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and took the large , expensive looking bag that malik had brought in with him and set it on the counter while they calmed down from their argument . [SEP]
[CLS] the smells em ##ana ##ting from the bag were actually making her mouth water and she realized she was incredibly hungry . [SEP]
[CLS] she refused to attribute her hunger to having sex with malik the night before though . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t give him credit for anything ! [SEP]
[CLS] except turning her life upside down again ! [SEP]
[CLS] malik turned back to the boys , his eyes hung ##rily watching each of them and sir ##i instantly knew what he was trying to do . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is jacob , ' ' she explained , pointing to her little guy on the right . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can tell him by the little fr ##eck ##les here on his ear , ' ' she said and tick ##led jacob behind his ear , smiling when he giggled and tried to stop her by lifting his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and this is samuel , ' ' she said , moving to the other side of the table . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can tell him apart by the wig ##gle in his nose , ' ' she teased , ` ` and by the darker eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he has slightly darker hair as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] turning to malik she said , ` ` they ' re fra ##tern ##al twins but they ' re so alike that they are almost identical . [SEP]
[CLS] and they already like trick ##ing people who ca n ' t tell them apart as well . [SEP]
[CLS] right boys ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and winked at them as they grinned up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` guys , ' ' she said , pulling their attention away from the bags in front of them , ` ` remember how i told you that your daddy was a very busy man ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] when she received a nod from both , she went on , ` ` well , he ' s really sorry and he ' s here now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to malik and took a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is your father , guys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the boys did n ' t react at all . [SEP]
[CLS] they continued to stare up at him , their blank faces not really showing anything at all . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced at malik , who was staring right back at them , with an identical expression on his face as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , just to break the silence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you guys okay with us sharing our lives with your dad ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s come an awful ##ly long way just to meet you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam was the first to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` momma says we ca n ' t go around naked . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned to malik as if seeking confirmation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you were naked last night . [SEP]
[CLS] does that mean you ' ll let me go naked too ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] of all the things she ' d thought they might say when they first met their father , sir ##i could honestly say that question was the absolute last thing she would have guessed that he would ask . [SEP]
[CLS] her mouth fell open and she stared , wondering what the best way to answer her son was under this situation . [SEP]
[CLS] malik , bless his heart , spoke up and gave the answer that made her heart melt just a little bit towards him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if your mom says that we ca n ' t go around naked , then we ca n ' t do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam ' s crest ##fall ##en face only lasted for a moment before he per ##ked up and thought up his next question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you going to come to school with us today ? [SEP]
[CLS] momma always comes to school and gives us a hug and a kiss before we can go play . [SEP]
[CLS] she makes us , ' ' he replied with a grimace on his cute little face . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i bent over his head and gave him a big , loud sm ##oo ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and do n ' t you forget it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said and tick ##led his tu ##mmy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but we ' re not going to school today . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to spend some time with your dad . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up and glanced at malik , then pulled her eyes quickly away , afraid of the way he was looking at her right now . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t tell if he was admiring the way she treated the boys , or if he was just amused by her teasing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you bring for breakfast ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying to distract him . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued looking down at her for a moment , then he pushed himself away from the counter and picked up the bags . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i actually have no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] i told the chef to make something for kids and adults . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i grimaced and peered into the bags . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think , guys ? [SEP]
[CLS] do we trust him ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s not used to being a dad . [SEP]
[CLS] he might have really gone off the mark here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she almost laughed when they both looked into the bag , bump ##ing their heads in their eager ##ness to find out what was inside . [SEP]
[CLS] malik chuckled and carefully took the bag away , pulling out several boxes with an elaborate label on the front . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s see how badly i did on my first try . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he opened one box and raised his eyebrows , then handed it to sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is probably for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled out another one and looked at the contents and smiled slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think this is probably a good meal for a cute kid , ' ' he said and glanced at sam and jacob , both eager with wide eyes , the anticipation making their little bodies wig ##gle in excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] he handed the box to jacob who took it with a distracted ` ` thank you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before he peered inside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cool ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he exclaimed and grinned over at sam who was leaning as far over the table as possible so he could see inside the box . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` its pancakes in the shape of different kinds of animals ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he exclaimed . [SEP]
[CLS] sam looked up at malik , his eyes pleading for something just as interesting . [SEP]
[CLS] malik pulled out the next box and peered inside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yep , this is another one for a kid , ' ' he said and handed the box to sam . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` awesome ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam said as he happily clapped his hands over his own box of animal shaped pancakes . [SEP]
[CLS] the last box he kept for himself , not even bothering to look inside as he turned to sir ##i , wink ##ing at her amused expression as her sons dug into the pancakes without even bothering to wait for the syrup . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re made of to ##fu and i think the chef even put a bit of fl ##ax seed in them , ' ' malik whispered in her ear , then ni ##bbled slightly , sending shivers throughout her whole body . [SEP]
[CLS] she jumped and almost lost her own box which contained a perfectly cooked om ##ele ##t with goo ##ey cheese and lots of grille ##d vegetables . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` by the way , we ' re not through with that original discussion from last night , ' ' he said and sat down at the table between the boys , but not before he chuckled over the blush that pink ##ened her cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] the three males sat at the table , her sons asking malik questions about where he was from , what it was like in dub ##an , why he lived there instead of here , would they ever be able to visit dub ##an and would the people there like them if they came . [SEP]
[CLS] the questions were amazing and she could n ' t believe how much knowledge her sons had acquired about desert life and the various parts of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] when they ' d eaten all they could of their pan ##cake animals , the three of them wandered outside and malik introduced them to the body guards , explaining what they were doing and how they should always be in sight of their guards . [SEP]
[CLS] this was an area sir ##i had n ' t anticipated , and was n ' t really ready for . [SEP]
[CLS] but since he had n ' t spoken to her about it before , she was n ' t sure how she could deal with it . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been alone with her boys for so long , making all the decisions , never having to consult with anyone , this was a new area for her . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurred to her that malik had given her a huge compliment . [SEP]
[CLS] he was accepting these two boys as his own with only her word that they were his offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew others in his country would need a dna test to prove pat ##ern ##ity , but malik had just accepted her word . [SEP]
[CLS] malik took the boys to the playground down the street and they were both eager to show him all the things they could do . [SEP]
[CLS] she followed , watching in amazement as they played and talked with their new father , getting to know him and finding out everything they could about him . [SEP]
[CLS] they had simple sandwiches for lunch and malik continued to answer their questions , but sir ##i could tell that the boys were winding down . [SEP]
[CLS] normally , they were okay for about an hour after their lunch , but because they had n ' t slept well last night due to the frog de ##ba ##cle , they were more fatigue ##d that usual . [SEP]
[CLS] a part of her wanted to keep them awake , using them as a buffer against being along with malik , but since their eyes were slowly closing as they sat at the table , trying hard to finish their lunch , sir ##i knew that she needed to put them down for their afternoon nap . [SEP]
[CLS] malik carried jacob while sir ##i pulled sam up out of his chair and followed behind . [SEP]
[CLS] they laid the boys down on their beds and sir ##i pulled a blanket up over each of them , kissing them and lowering the room ' s blinds to dim the bright , afternoon sunshine that was streaming through the bedroom windows . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 6 she found malik back out in the living room , looking at their pictures on the wall once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re great kids , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve done an amazing job with them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sat down on the sofa , her heart racing in fear of what he was going to say next . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you ' ' , she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` marry me , ' ' he said when he turned around to look at her . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i jumped and looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to marry you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was already shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because . . . . ' ' she shook her head and looked away . [SEP]
[CLS] discussions of marriage definitely had n ' t been in her plan for the day . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , marriage to malik had been banished from her imagination when he ' d married that other woman . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , this father ##hood thing is all new to you and i sincerely understand that you need an heir , but let ' s not jump into a relationship that wo n ' t work . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s time to figure out how to deal with the kids and their future . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve known about the boys for less than a day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and now that i know about them , they need to be raised in dub ##an . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she swung around , hearing the words she ' d been expecting and fearing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] they need to be raised right here . [SEP]
[CLS] in their home where they can have a normal life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sir ##i , that ' s just not possible . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re princes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that declaration startled her and she did n ' t want to acknowledge the truth of that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are little boys who like building things and exploring their world , discovering new animals and seeing what mischief they can create . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head , refusing to let her stick her head in the sand when it came to their heritage . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are royal princes who will have responsibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] some they will like and others they wo n ' t like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i wo n ' t let you determine their future when they are only three years old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` their futures were determined at conception , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] and regardless of what you want , they need to be raised in the palace where they can be kept safe . [SEP]
[CLS] it does n ' t matter if you like it or not , i have enemies that will try to harm them . [SEP]
[CLS] they are n ' t safe here . [SEP]
[CLS] this house alone is too small to protect them adequately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she crossed her arms over her chest , facing him with defiance and frustration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not leaving here , ' ' she stated em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and took a step closer , obviously st ##ri ##ving for patience in the face of her rejection . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about if we compromise initially ? [SEP]
[CLS] let me get them into a more secure house , one that can be guarded better , with a perimeter that is n ' t bordering on four other peoples ' homes . [SEP]
[CLS] the neighbors here are going to start getting suspicious when they see armed guards . . . ' ' her eyes widened and she looked outside , trying to see through the bushes to find the men in her yard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` those men are armed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she interrupted , horrified at the idea of guns or weapons being near her sons . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t have guns in the house , malik ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik refrain ##ed from rolling his eyes , but just barely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course they are armed , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] they ca n ' t stop bad guys from stealing our kids with a bb gun . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i curled her arms around herself , staring at the pictures on the wall of her tiny little guys . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ignore the idea of the weapons sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] if we can get the boys out of this small house , you wo n ' t see the guns or any of the other weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] after you drop off the boys at school tomorrow , we can take a look at houses in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] you can decide on whichever house suits your needs the best . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t try and influence you at all . [SEP]
[CLS] once my guards survey the possibilities , they ' ll let us know the options so the final decision will all be yours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about that for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she could at least go through the motions , could n ' t she ? [SEP]
[CLS] and at least tomorrow she ' d be with a real ##tor , someone who could ease the tension between her and malik . [SEP]
[CLS] with the boys sleeping , she really could use a break from being alone with him right about now . [SEP]
[CLS] even arguing with him was wearing her down and she was already exhausted so he was really getting to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave in without much grace . [SEP]
[CLS] she was still res ##ent ##ful of even having to compromise and it seemed as if malik was getting his way once again . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t come up with an alternative that would keep her boys safe though . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i drop the kids off normally about nine o ' clock . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t need to get into the office early and i make my own hours . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled , his admiration for her business ac ##umen coming through with his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s nice being the boss , ' ' he said , his voice husky and deep . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned forward , invading her space a bit more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m really proud of your success , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] i looked into your company and you ' ve created a great idea with the educational toys . [SEP]
[CLS] you have an impressive marketing strategy too . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wished his praise did n ' t matter . [SEP]
[CLS] but hearing him say something like that , it made her heart flutter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had to be successful . [SEP]
[CLS] i had those two guys to look after , ' ' she said , nodding in the general direction of jacob and sam ' s still quiet bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you could have worked for another company . [SEP]
[CLS] you did n ' t need to take the risk of starting off on your own . [SEP]
[CLS] i always thought there was something special about you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if she was so special , why had he married someone else ? [SEP]
[CLS] why had n ' t she been special enough for him four years ago ? [SEP]
[CLS] those questions rose up to choke her and she turned away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , it all worked out in the end , did n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] there was a long silence and she refused to turn around and look at him to determine what he was thinking or feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong , sir ##i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t you have some work to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] the boys wo n ' t be awake for another hour . [SEP]
[CLS] you can go do . . . whatever it is that you do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t respond immediately and she wondered if she ' d hurt his feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] but that was ridiculous . [SEP]
[CLS] malik did n ' t have feelings to hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] he was superman with a palace to prove it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you let me take all of you out for dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could almost feel the heat of his body as he stepped closer to her . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted so badly to just lean back and feel his strength against her , for him to wrap his arms around her and hold her close , to tell her that he had n ' t wanted to marry that other woman . [SEP]
[CLS] that she was the only one he ' d ever cared about . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even hope that he loved her , just that she had meant something to him . [SEP]
[CLS] something other than simply a convenient lay when he was in town . [SEP]
[CLS] but he had married another woman . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d married her only days after holding her in his arms and making love to her until she cried out with her pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d needed his touch so much back then and it had been pure hell learning to live without that feeling after his betrayal . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t do that again . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to be strong and hold firm about not becoming physical with him . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , not being physical with him again . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t let last night happen again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] that would be nice . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys would love a dinner night out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will you be more comfortable in a specific restaurant ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged her shoulders and looked away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anything will be fine , ' ' she stated . [SEP]
[CLS] anything that would keep her from being alone with him , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll pick you guys up at six o ' clock then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d better meet you somewhere because i have the car seats set up in my car . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll meet you back here at six o ' clock then . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he walked to the door and put his hand to the knob . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for today , ' ' he said before he strode out of her house . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched through the front window as he walked to the limousine , his guards falling in around him as soon as he stepped outside of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] she was amazed that she ' d never seen that before , but now that she thought about it , they had n ' t ventured out very often after the first few dates . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d met him at his place , or they ' d travel somewhere to be alone . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a very isolated relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 7 sir ##i was nervous about a dinner out with malik but not because she was afraid she would be alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was more anxious about bringing her boys to dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure he knew how little boys behaved out in public . [SEP]
[CLS] and if they had to wait for their dinner ? [SEP]
[CLS] it would be all over . [SEP]
[CLS] malik was used to fancy dinners , expensive restaurants , five star chefs with a multi - course meal . [SEP]
[CLS] her boys were already hungry by the time he arrived on her doorstep to pick them up , even though she ' d given them a snack only a half hour ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are we going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob asked as they climbed into their car seats that had been installed in the limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] samuel strapped himself in , but his todd ##ler hands were n ' t quite up to the task of snapping the clasp of the unfamiliar buckle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope it has something good . [SEP]
[CLS] momma always takes us to blue bird , ' ' he qui ##pped , referring to the family friendly restaurant that served great burger ##s and corn dogs , not exactly the health ##iest meal , but it was a fun night out and they only went there occasionally . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how about jungle jim ' s for dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and was rewarded by dual shriek ' s of delight and excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i breathed a sigh of relief , then blushed when he caught her . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to look away when he raised one eyebrow , as if to say , ` ` did you doubt me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] which she had and she ' d been caught . [SEP]
[CLS] the car seats were facing backwards which left the entire forward facing seat for her and malik . [SEP]
[CLS] she was glad actually , because that allowed her to make sure there was enough room separating her from malik on the drive , and she pushed herself all the way over to the opposite side , daring him to sit closer . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , he respected her need for space and did n ' t push it , but even having two feet of space between them seemed too close . [SEP]
[CLS] the drive to the restaurant was short and the boys were eager to get out and see all the crazy animals inside . [SEP]
[CLS] the restaurant really was an incredible spectacle , with trees and parrot ##s that would reply to the kids , even if the response did n ' t make much sense . [SEP]
[CLS] there was also a large fish tank against one wall and malik had arranged for their table to be right in the middle of that wall . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys were en ##th ##ral ##led to be that close to the fish and sharks and eagerly pointed to the various species swimming around . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i let the boys have the chairs that looked straight onto the fish tank , which meant that she and malik were sitting next to each other on the opposite side . [SEP]
[CLS] normally , that was n ' t a problem , but with him so close , he even put his arm across the back of her chair . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried leaning forward , but her back grew tired since she sl ##ou ##ched most of the time while working . [SEP]
[CLS] the waitress quickly arrived and took their orders . [SEP]
[CLS] because there was so much to look at with the fish floating by , it was the easiest dinner out she ' d ever had . [SEP]
[CLS] the food even arrived quickly , although sir ##i was n ' t sure if the boys realized what they were eating since their eyes were watching the fish in front of them instead of on their plates . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when you get to be older , i ' ll take both of you s ##nor ##kel ##ing and scuba diving . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob asked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s when you get to swim in the ocean and the fish swim right by you . [SEP]
[CLS] it feels like you can reach out and touch them , but you really should n ' t touch anything underwater . [SEP]
[CLS] your hands might have something on them that could harm you . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , some of them might bite you back , ' ' he explained with a wink . [SEP]
[CLS] their eyes grew round with the wonder of that kind of possibility . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do they swim ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked softly , watching sir ##i pick at her salad . [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded and put her fork down , too tense to eat anything with him leaning close and almost whispering in her ear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve had them in lessons last winter so they are familiar with water . [SEP]
[CLS] they are n ' t afraid of anything that i know of yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and leaned closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` unlike you , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled away and looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not afraid of the water , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , but you ' re afraid of me , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! [SEP]
[CLS] why would you say that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she demanded and pushed her hair behind her ear , picking up her fork and forcing herself to take a bite despite the fact that her stomach was fluttering wildly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or maybe you ' re afraid of what i make you feel . [SEP]
[CLS] interesting question either way , in my opinion . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shifted away from him slightly , wishing she could stop blushing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think too much of yourself , malik . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do i ? [SEP]
[CLS] so if i were to do this , ' ' he said and let his hand drop to her back , his fingers sliding against the muscles lightly , ` ` it would n ' t bother you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers touched a spot on her back that he knew always drove her crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] it was like an er ##ogen ##ous zone outside of the norm and she hated that he remembered how much she loved to be caressed on her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped and sat up straight again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because we ' re not doing that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but we are , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re going to be doing this , and so much more ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i ' s stomach coiled into knots with his promise and she shuddered at the images that immediately popped into her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to feel like this ! [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to be immune to him , to be able to keep her distance but her whole body wanted to lean into his touch , to move her chair closer to his body and find warmth and comfort , as well as the excitement he always provided whenever he touched her . [SEP]
[CLS] damn him ! [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted her old life back before he re - entered her world and turned it upside down ! [SEP]
[CLS] the evening progressed much easier after that . [SEP]
[CLS] the only awkward moment was after she ' d tucked the boys into bed , she was alone with malik in the dimly lit hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you for dinner , ' ' she said nervously and moved back into her family room , turning on as many lights as possible to break the intimate feeling of the now quiet house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re welcome , ' ' he replied and pulled her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her thoroughly , but just when she was shivering with need , he stepped back and released her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you take the day off again tomorrow ? [SEP]
[CLS] we need to look at some things together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she nodded her head , her hand shaking as she lifted it to her tingling mouth , trying to subtly wipe away the effect he had on her system when he kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] yes . [SEP]
[CLS] tomorrow , ' ' she said , hoping this meant he was leaving . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked to the door and laid his hand on the door ##k ##nob . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not finished , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] this is just the beginning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was shaking her head , trying to deny it but he was already out the door before she could say anything to contra ##dict his words as she sat alone in her little family room , she sank down into the sofa and curled up , staring at nothing as her mind frantically tried to figure out what to do about this whole situation . [SEP]
[CLS] but the emotional stress of the last few days finally caught up with her . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried , but failed to keep her eyes open and work out a solution . [SEP]
[CLS] as midnight approached , she was fast asleep on her sofa , still curled up and her dreams taking her to the place where she would n ' t allow herself to go while awake ; directly into malik ' s arms and making love to him until they were both too tired to move . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 8 ` ` okay , so where are we going ? [SEP]
[CLS] what was the big surprise today that we could n ' t talk about around the boys ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i asked as she walked out of the preschool area . [SEP]
[CLS] she hid her eyes behind sunglasses , worried that he might see something she did n ' t want him to know . [SEP]
[CLS] he was too per ##ceptive of her moods lately . [SEP]
[CLS] he stood less than a foot from her and looked down into her face , knowing that she was concerned about what was going to happen to her happy little family life . [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t do it if it were n ' t so important . [SEP]
[CLS] but the next step had to be done . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have several houses lined up for us to walk through . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would we look at houses ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we discussed this a few nights ago , but you did n ' t want to accept it . [SEP]
[CLS] but sir ##i , you have to understand that samuel and jacob can never be just normal boys . [SEP]
[CLS] i need them to be in a secure environment . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t let anything happen to them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i took a deep breath and stood still for a moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to think about this rational ##ly , and do what was best for the boys and not what she wanted to maintain . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , she was really just maintaining her little cottage out of sentimental reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d hate it there if anything happened to the boys . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] let ' s take a look . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik relaxed with her acceptance , had actually been prepared for a longer argument over any possible move . [SEP]
[CLS] but thankfully she was being reasonable . [SEP]
[CLS] he just hoped she ' d continue to think that way as she walked through the houses his security team had already approved . [SEP]
[CLS] he had a plan but knew he ' d have to take it slow . [SEP]
[CLS] this little woman was ski ##tti ##sh and did n ' t trust him . [SEP]
[CLS] if he were in her place , he would n ' t trust him either but now it was time to toss all that behind them and move forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excellent . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you for this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pushed away from the limousine and opened the car door for her . [SEP]
[CLS] the driver had already taken the car seats out and stored them somewhere else so there was plenty of room in the back now . [SEP]
[CLS] as they drove through unfamiliar streets , malik had to take a phone call which was fine with her . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know what to talk to him about . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt like she was with a stranger , and the mention yesterday that her sons were actually princes was still a huge shock . [SEP]
[CLS] they pulled up to an extremely large house with pal ##lad ##ian windows , a gate with a security guard standing out front and several other security measures she was stunned to see in place . [SEP]
[CLS] it made her wonder what other measures were around that she was n ' t aware of . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where ' s the real ##tor ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i asked as malik led her into the house , not even needing a key to open the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and should n ' t we knock before entering someone else ' s house ? [SEP]
[CLS] or are they expecting us ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik chuckled and put a hand to the small of her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this house has been vacant for about six months . [SEP]
[CLS] the previous tenant died suddenly and the children live on the west coast . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' ve been trying to sell it ever since their father died . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah . [SEP]
[CLS] so it ' s a bargain , huh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked tentatively , warily looking up at the ornate ##ly decorated pink marble foyer with gold painted statues and a grand staircase that wound around the circular room to a landing at the top complete with black bal ##ust ##rade ##s and more gold statues . [SEP]
[CLS] even the ceiling was decorated ala michelangelo style celestial type of art , but sir ##i was n ' t sure if the painting was actually a work of art or a . . . . well , she could n ' t really describe it and she blushed as she pulled her eyes away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess you could say that , ' ' he replied softly , sm ##oth ##ering the chuckle at her not so subtle reaction to the not - so - subtle sexual images on the ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as if he did n ' t know already , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i ' s poker face , at least in this case , was non - existent . [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip and looked upwards again , needing another look at the ceiling to make sure she had n ' t imagined the scene . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s a very . . . nice house , ' ' she replied carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] in reality , she hated it . [SEP]
[CLS] every little detail and golden covered cher ##ub was a disgusting show of po ##mp ##ous wealth and she could n ' t imagine living in a place like this . [SEP]
[CLS] it was beyond pre ##ten ##tious and bordering on obscene both in the b ##lat ##ant wealth and the decorations that seemed somehow seed ##y and creepy in a sexual way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s look around a bit more , ' ' he said , already able to tell that she did n ' t want to live here . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remember , we can always red ##ec ##ora ##te . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you like this house ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , worried that he really did like the feel and the decor . [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered his penthouse from four years ago and had a hard time rec ##on ##ci ##ling his previous taste to the interior of this house . [SEP]
[CLS] that place had been decorated with strong , masculine colors like tan ##s and browns or grey and black , but they were still elegant and refined . [SEP]
[CLS] this was just . . . . tack ##y and pre ##ten ##tious . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head as he surveyed the cheap bureau mas ##que ##rad ##ing as a louis xiv marble topped hallway table . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t hard to detect the poor work ##manship and the chips already broken out of the white marble . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t be the one red ##ec ##ora ##ting . [SEP]
[CLS] feel free to hire a decor ##ator to make the house the way you want it to be in any style that suits you and the boys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , actually depressed that he ' d brought her to a place like this . [SEP]
[CLS] it was so completely outside of her tastes that it seemed like a complete waste of their time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t afford a decor ##ator , ' ' she replied , angry that he was being so casual about moving them out of their current home and into a hollow ##ed out bo ##rde ##llo . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her elbow gently and navigate ##d them through the foyer and into the office , which seemed much more normal with the heavy wooden desk and large , leather chair . [SEP]
[CLS] the books on the shelves were well worn , but dusty , indicating that the previous owner had n ' t used them often . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked around , amused that some of the shelves actually had fake books , as in wooden pieces cut out to look like a row of books complete with gilded edges . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t have to worry about money from now on , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] i will be taking care of you and the boys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can take care of them well enough ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped back . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was just being defensive now because malik ' s wealth was so far out of her league she could n ' t even begin to imagine his net worth , much less how she could afford to pay for the security malik considered necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought about contra ##dict ##ing her , knowing that the boys would need private tutor ##s as well as many different kinds of instructors . [SEP]
[CLS] he planned to have the boys taught how to ride horses , teach them combat training , economics , politics , languages . . . anything that would help them survive in the world they were going to be thrown into . [SEP]
[CLS] being ruler came with the per ##ks of wealth , but ruling was also a huge pain in the ass ! [SEP]
[CLS] as they walked into the living room together , sir ##i stopped at the entry ##way , stunned by what she was seeing in the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my , ' ' she replied softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s quite an under ##sta ##tem ##ent , ' ' malik replied with a cough of surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i tried very hard , but staring at a nude painting of a man who was , to put it kindly , rot ##und , while angels danced above his head just caught sir ##i ' s sense of humor and would n ' t release it . [SEP]
[CLS] it started off as a snort in place of a chuckle , but as she looked to the right , she found another nude , of the same man ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think it ' s the previous owner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and covered her mouth to st ##if ##le her laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm ##m . . . i ' m guessing it ' s a strong possibility , ' ' he said as he looked to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i followed his gaze and gasped in horror at the painting of the same man , with the same ph ##ys ##ique , but the angels were no longer angels but had transformed into fairies . [SEP]
[CLS] all of whom were kissing the man in various parts of his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hope this home was n ' t offered fully furnished , ' ' sir ##i finally got out but she could n ' t control her laughter any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] the hi ##lar ##ity was just too much and she was bent over laughing as she looked at the three portraits of the man in the buff . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he really thinks something big of himself , ' ' she replied , all anger and frustration of the previous moment dissipated with the views from the horrific living room . [SEP]
[CLS] both of them walked rapidly out of the house , sir ##i laughing up ##ro ##ario ##usly while malik was able to maintain a bit more decor ##um and was only chuck ##ling at the paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] they did n ' t even bother going through the rest of the house , just too amazed by that front room to even bother . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , on to the next , ' ' malik declared , nodding to his guards who immediately moved into position , startling sir ##i as she entered the limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] malik said something to the security guard , who looked stunned initially , then shook his head and opened the door to the car , all the while maintaining his perimeter search of the area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you say to him ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as they were seated in the vehicle . [SEP]
[CLS] malik shook his head slightly , an amused expression on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told him the house looked like a fat man ' s bo ##rde ##llo . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t sm ##oth ##er the laughter at his comment and since they were now out of the house , she did n ' t even try . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i loved the pink marble . [SEP]
[CLS] do you think that was to make the ladies more comfortable ? [SEP]
[CLS] or to add a bit of romance to his day ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik chuckled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d hate to see that man trying to be romantic . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it felt good to laugh with malik , sir ##i thought as they traveled down the road , heading to the next house he wanted her to see . [SEP]
[CLS] the past several days had been so filled with tension and trying to avoid being caught alone with him , the absence of tension , even if it was only momentary , was extremely nice . [SEP]
[CLS] she sat back against the soft leather seats with a smile on her face as she watched the countryside pass by . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t done that since i arrived , ' ' malik said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] she spun her head around , looking up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` done what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her stomach muscles instantly tens ##ing as her awareness of him came right back . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to sc ##oot away , to put just a few more precious inches between their bodies , but she did n ' t want him to know that she was aware of him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was trying to pretend she was indifferent to him , that she was over the attraction she ' d had in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , as he looked down at her , his heat see ##ping into her arm and leg , she did n ' t think he was buying her act . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched as his eyes dil ##ated and she thought he moved slightly closer , but was n ' t sure and did n ' t want to test it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying to sound more confident and unaffected than she was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] except when jacob or samuel does something like put frogs in your fridge . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she had to laugh at the memory now that she was n ' t surrounded by scary , jumping b ##lo ##bs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were trying to protect me that night , were n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , chuck ##ling at the memory now that it was in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` all i heard was your scream . [SEP]
[CLS] i had no idea what the threat was . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a giggle escaped her and she covered her mouth with her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you ran out naked , slammed me up against the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] where on earth had you stored that knife ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked through her laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i always carry a knife . [SEP]
[CLS] who knows when i have to protect a dams ##el in distress ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` from frogs , ' ' she finished and the laughter just could n ' t be stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] she let it roll and was actually holding her stomach when the laughter finally subsided . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my ! [SEP]
[CLS] could you imagine if that scene had been recorded ? [SEP]
[CLS] all those frogs jumping around , my kids trying to protect me from you who are ten times their size and you standing there naked with a knife . [SEP]
[CLS] what a chaotic mess ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was cute , ' ' he replied and leaned back but the smile on his face told her that he ' d found the memory just as humorous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m impressed that both boys are so protective . [SEP]
[CLS] of you and the frogs although samuel might need to re ##thi ##nk his priorities . [SEP]
[CLS] it shows they will both be good leaders . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that reminder sober ##ed her instantly and she looked away , pretending to watch the trees pass by outside the car but in her mind , she was scared for her boys . [SEP]
[CLS] for what might be in their future . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` promise me that they ' ll be okay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik took her hand in his and gave her a reassuring squeeze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll work this out together . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll teach them how to survive and they ' ll thrive . [SEP]
[CLS] trust me , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i shivered and could n ' t look up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] trust was the problem , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t trust him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had at one point and he ' d broken that trust . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to even try to trust him again for fear of being hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] luckily , the driver pulled into another driveway at that point , re ##lie ##ving her of needing to reply . [SEP]
[CLS] the next house was better , but had no furniture in it . [SEP]
[CLS] the lines were more elegant , less ornate and much more to sir ##i ' s liking . [SEP]
[CLS] it was still much bigger than she would prefer . [SEP]
[CLS] and much too empty . [SEP]
[CLS] as they walked through the house , she tried to step away from malik because each time he touched her , she wanted more . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him to pull her into his arms and kiss her but she had to remain firm in maintaining her distance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why is n ' t a real ##tor here to help walk us through the houses ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked after he touched her back to lead her through one of the rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the real ##tor made all the arrangements with the owners but she went ahead . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to view the houses with you alone instead of being bothered by a chat ##ty woman trying to sell us something that we did n ' t like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i nodded her head , but was nervous about being in a house without anyone else to distract them . [SEP]
[CLS] she would much prefer a chat ##ty lady who would at least be a diversion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is nice , ' ' she replied , pretending to look around , but there were just very large rooms with large windows and no curtains . [SEP]
[CLS] the carpets were cream , the walls white , the foyer a white marble . [SEP]
[CLS] the kitchen had white cabinets and tan , granite counter ##tops with top of the line appliances . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is large . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and white , ' ' malik said out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i nodded , and tried to step away from him , needing a bit of space . [SEP]
[CLS] she moved around the counter , just to breathe a little bit of non - malik scented air . [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered that scent , remembered how much she ' d loved it . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always breathed in his cologne as soon as he ' d pulled her into his arms after a long absence and she ' d just close her eyes and sa ##vor ##ed the feeling of having his muscular arms wrapped around her , his scent filling her senses and the anticipation of him taking her into his bedroom and making love for the rest of the night . [SEP]
[CLS] she was older now . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t just fall into bed with this man . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , there were n ' t any beds in the house ! [SEP]
[CLS] a fact which should make her feel better , but the total absence of anything made her much more nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] her imagination was doing things , like wondering what it would be like if malik simply picked her up and placed her on the kitchen counter . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d never made love in the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t even sure if his previous penthouse had a kitchen since it was entirely possible that he ordered in from whatever restaurant sprang to mind . [SEP]
[CLS] there had always been food delivered , but where it had come from , she had no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s look around upstairs , ' ' he said , his voice deep , becoming husky . [SEP]
[CLS] was he feeling the same thing she was ? [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered what she would do if she needed to get away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] would he stop if she said no ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was being ridiculous ##ly silly . [SEP]
[CLS] of course he would ! [SEP]
[CLS] malik was n ' t the kind of guy who would rape a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] he was kind and gentle . [SEP]
[CLS] a liar , but still very gentle . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never hurt her before . [SEP]
[CLS] it was really her own reaction that she should be concerned about . [SEP]
[CLS] he would stop if she told him no , but when had she ever been able to tell him no ? [SEP]
[CLS] once he took her into his arms , she was n ' t capable of saying anything . [SEP]
[CLS] well , there were a few things but sir ##i did n ' t think ` ` faster ' ' or ` ` please ' ' would keep her safe from his love ##making . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked up the stairs , painfully self conscious that he was s right behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] she actually thought about putting her hands behind her , just to block his view of her der ##rier ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want him thinking about the past and how he ' d bent her over his bed , entering her from behind with his hands on her bottom . [SEP]
[CLS] the feeling had been incredible from that angle and she could feel her body heating up just from that memory . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s look at the smaller rooms first , ' ' he suggested , his voice echoing in the silence of the house , the sound vibrating off the walls and coming out stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] there was nothing to absorb the sound so any noise traveled without hind ##rance , making her cr ##inge at the sound . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s fine , ' ' she replied and turned to the left instead of the right . [SEP]
[CLS] she definitely did n ' t mind his suggestion , not wanting to enter the owner ' s suite alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] not that she would be sleeping in there anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] not with him at least . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked in the first room , a large , air ##y room with hardwood floors and more white walls but the windows would let in a lot of sunlight . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this would be nice for the boys , ' ' she said , trying to find anything to say to ease the awkward ##ness of the silence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they would love to have the hardwood floors to race their cars along . [SEP]
[CLS] although they might scratch the surface . [SEP]
[CLS] they play pretty hard lately and they ' re going to get worse as they get older and stronger . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was ram ##bling and tried to stop herself , but she was just too nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would n ' t worry about that , ' ' he replied , leaning against the door jam ##b , watching her flutter from closet to closet , then inspecting the bathroom . [SEP]
[CLS] she even looked in the cabinets and he almost chuckled at her nervous ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] his body was already reacting to her cute bottom sticking up in the air and the charming blush creeping over her soft skin . [SEP]
[CLS] the blush told him that she was feeling exactly the same way he was , but wishing it were otherwise . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her , no doubt about it , but he wanted all of her . [SEP]
[CLS] and soon , he ' d get her . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her in his bed , in his home and pregnant with more of his children . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , he wanted to see her body swell with his child , her breasts en ##lar ##ge with the milk that would no ##uri ##sh the babe . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought she was sexy now , he could n ' t imagine how incredible she would look once they started having more children . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to grow old with her and share more memories together . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d have that , he just needed to convince her of his commitment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s keep on going , ' ' he said , needing some sort of distraction to keep himself from thinking about wrapping his arms around her and feeling her softness press against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , ' ' sir ##i replied and followed him down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] she peered into the other rooms , not very interested since , if they chose this house , they would n ' t really use these bedrooms for anything . [SEP]
[CLS] she really had no idea why he wanted such a large house anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] except for the yard , she supposed as she glanced outside one of the bare windows . [SEP]
[CLS] there really was a great deal of land surrounding this house . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea that there were even houses like this so close to the city with so much land but she supposed that , if one had the money , they could buy anything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is there a reason we need eight bedrooms ? [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll only be using three of them , wo n ' t we ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the boys will be in the same bedroom , wo n ' t they ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she focused all of her attention on the laundry area , pretending to be fascinated by all the cabinets in that area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a good idea to have the laundry facilities on the same floor with the bedrooms . [SEP]
[CLS] it will be easier to get the clothes where they need to go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t really care where the wash ##er and dry ##er were right at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] all she cared about was ensuring that malik understood that she would not be sharing his bed . [SEP]
[CLS] they were walking into the owner ' s suite when he spun her around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t even think that you and i are n ' t going to share a bedroom , sir ##i ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he declared , his strong hands holding her wrists , pulling her close enough that she could smell his subtle after ##sha ##ve . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are n ' t going to share a room , malik . [SEP]
[CLS] we are n ' t sleeping together again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t help it when she spoke like that . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d thrown down a challenge and he was n ' t one to just let something like that pass by him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d always been competitive , but having her say something like that was the equivalent to waving a red flag in front of a raging bull . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think so ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his voice soft and his body already aroused , not just by her challenge but by being with her all day . [SEP]
[CLS] malik ' s voice was gentle , but she could sense the rising anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , let ' s be sensible about this , ' ' she said , trying to pl ##aca ##te him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not meant for each other . [SEP]
[CLS] we tried four years ago and you chose someone else . [SEP]
[CLS] if we were right for each other , then . . . ' ' ` ` you ' d do n ' t know all the details about four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t make declaration ##s on only half the knowledge , ' ' he commanded , leaning forward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but even more important , you ca n ' t claim you do n ' t want me , sir ##i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she frantically shook her head , praying she could push him away if he came any closer . [SEP]
[CLS] but already , her palms were it ##ching to touch him , to feel him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] you have to accept that ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said , frustrated that she sounded so breathless and weak . [SEP]
[CLS] she pressed her hands against the wall just to make sure she did n ' t reach out and do something stupid , like touch him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was becoming weaker by the moment as he came closer to her , his heat warming her body and filling up her senses . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted this man , but she had to fight this attraction . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d gone through the hurt and betrayal once before , she could n ' t do it again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do i find your denial ##s not ringing true ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked rhetoric ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re lying to both of us , sir ##i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not , ' ' she whispered , her eyes dropping to his mouth , watching with frustration and anticipation as it came closer . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind told her to pull back , to show him with actions what she was saying with her words . [SEP]
[CLS] but her body , so desperate for his touch , ignored her brain once again . [SEP]
[CLS] why she was so weak where this man was concerned was beyond her , but she could n ' t seem to pull away . [SEP]
[CLS] and then his mouth touched hers and she did n ' t want to pull away any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to press herself against him , to feel his body ' s reaction and rev ##el in the power she had over this man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do this again , ' ' she pleaded , begging him to have the will ##power that she could n ' t seem to muster . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i must , ' ' was his only response before he covered her mouth with his own . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her so badly and she was here , willing and soft and warm and lovely . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her like he ' d never wanted any other woman , was anticipating her body ' s welcoming heat like a drug addict needed the next fix . [SEP]
[CLS] when his hands traveled from her arms up to her shoulders and pulled her closer , she shivered in his arms and that was all the declaration of her submission he needed . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her , she wanted him and they were alone . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her hard against him and when her arms wrapped around his neck , his own hands dropped to her waist , sliding down to her adorable bottom that he ' d wanted to touch so badly while walking up the stairs moments ago . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been taunting him with her walk and she did n ' t even know it . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her closer , needing her complete surrender and when he got it , he lowered her onto the carpet , his hands slipping under her clothing to feel her soft skin once again . [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her deeply , absorbing her moans into his mouth and feeling her rise against his hand , her heart racing as he pressed his hand against her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted up slightly and looked around , as ##tou ##nded that he was actually making love to this woman in an empty house . [SEP]
[CLS] one that was n ' t even his . [SEP]
[CLS] yet ! [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her clothes off , un ##car ##ing of what was around him , which was nothing but hers and his discarded clothes at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] and a wall of windows where anyone could look into since there were n ' t any curtains . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] she was underneath him and writhing with her own need and he succumbed . [SEP]
[CLS] pulling her slacks off , he quickly came back down to her , covering her naked ##ness with his body . [SEP]
[CLS] and when his clothes hind ##ered him , he stood up and ripped his own clothes off . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t stop him . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , when he lowered himself to the floor , covering her once again , she opened her legs , just as eager for his invasion as he was . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me you want me , ' ' he ordered , holding his body above hers , looking down at her , seeing the sweat against her own brow and feeling the impatience , the urgency of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] watching her , seeing her body flushed with the heat of her own need and he almost gave in . [SEP]
[CLS] but he needed the words . [SEP]
[CLS] wanted to hear her say it . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d denied it too often over the past two days and he needed those words for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you , ' ' she almost screamed out , her body pressing against his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t make me wait ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d said it , and she could n ' t take back the words ! [SEP]
[CLS] with ex ##ult ##ation , he moved against her , his body pressing inside hers and feeling her tight ##ness close in around him . [SEP]
[CLS] this had never felt so good , so right ! [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t slow down , would n ' t let her hide . [SEP]
[CLS] he pounded into her , showing her with actions that she ' d been lying to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re mine , sir ##i , ' ' he said as he watched her face , moved in and out of her , pressing himself deeper and feeling her clench around him . [SEP]
[CLS] he almost lost it but he was determined to show her that they were perfect for each other . [SEP]
[CLS] and he also wanted to ensure that she could n ' t deny their attraction to each other any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] if this was the only way to get through to her , then he ' d use it . [SEP]
[CLS] and they ' d both enjoy the journey ! [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her shudder ##s start , he could n ' t help but let his own body find fulfillment . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been a day without this woman , without feeling this incredible heat and passion and that drove him harder . [SEP]
[CLS] she was like an addiction , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] one he was n ' t going to ignore or even fight . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , he ' d use it more and more to convince her that they were meant to be together . [SEP]
[CLS] as sir ##i came back down to earth , she could n ' t help but marvel at what an amazing lover malik was . [SEP]
[CLS] not that she had anything to compare it to , but she heard other women talk about sex with their partners and she could n ' t contribute . [SEP]
[CLS] they would laugh at how in ##ept their husbands or lovers were , how ins ##ens ##itive . [SEP]
[CLS] but malik was incredible , damn him ! [SEP]
[CLS] he knew exactly where to touch and how to move to drive her crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not having your own room , sir ##i , ' ' he growled as he bent low and kissed her neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re sleeping together , and that ' s final . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 9 sir ##i watched in wonder as malik stepped out of the limousine and approached the house . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been with him for a week in the new house and she could n ' t believe how messed up she felt . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so in love with the man she could barely think at work . [SEP]
[CLS] her desk was piled up with actions she needed to take , orders she needed to review and she found herself fan ##tas ##izing about him all the time . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d purchased that house last week , the one where they ' d made love on the floor in front of the windows , and sir ##i could n ' t believe how quickly he ' d made things happen . [SEP]
[CLS] she was living in the house now , with a decor ##ator quickly filling up the space and adding color . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob and samuel loved all the open space , the new play area they had in a small , fence ##d in area of the back yard and the play room filled with new toys and different games to play . [SEP]
[CLS] there were so many different toys for building from lego ##s to blocks and even some sort of rubber beams that would help them build forts . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d love that material so much , she ' d added it to her inventory and it was going to be the front cover specialty for the christmas catalog . [SEP]
[CLS] and they especially loved having a dad that came home to them every night , played with them , showed them how to do different things and taught them endless new ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] the part they loved the most , he never ran out of answers for their questions . [SEP]
[CLS] after dinner , they would climb onto his lap and ask him questions or they would sit on the floor and play with their toys and their curious minds would come up with the most amazing ideas , all of which malik encouraged and helped them to channel in positive ways . [SEP]
[CLS] for a man who had n ' t known the twins existed a month ago , he ' d certainly risen to the job of being a father with amazing speed . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys ' large bedroom had been the first for the recently hired decor ##ator to fur ##nish and she ' d added a wonderful surround of sports and animals . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d sat down and talked to jacob and samuel , asking them what they wanted on their walls , what kinds of animals they liked , what sports and any kind of secret places they might want . [SEP]
[CLS] the result was a mural of a jungle scene on one wall , a desert on another and a loft type sleeping area with a ` ` hideout ' ' below where they loved to hide from their mother . [SEP]
[CLS] the master bedroom had been the second area to be tackled and the decor ##ator done an outstanding job of creating an elegant , but sum ##pt ##uous room with masculine colors and feminine touches . [SEP]
[CLS] not that malik noticed . [SEP]
[CLS] he was with the boys until their bed times and then he ' d pull her into his arms and make love to her until she fell asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea what he was doing after she fell asleep , but he was gone by the time she woke up in the morning . [SEP]
[CLS] which made things a bit more difficult for her , she thought as she rushed out for work each morning after giving instructions to the new nanny and tutor . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i wanted to talk to malik about various issues but he was n ' t around to discuss them with her . [SEP]
[CLS] and when he was , he would n ' t let her talk much , having other plans for their nights together . [SEP]
[CLS] as much as she ' d objected to a move to a new house initially , she had to admit that life was a whole lot easier now , and in ways she had n ' t expected . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a fantastic nanny who watched over the boys and both of them loved her , eagerly running to greet her each morning after breakfast to find out what she was going to teach them during each day . [SEP]
[CLS] apparently malik gave her instructions but he was very consider ##ate about talking to sir ##i about those decisions as well , making her feel as if she were a part of the decision making process , when in fact , he was pushing the agenda . [SEP]
[CLS] for some reason , sir ##i was n ' t overly concerned with this since he explained why any particular lesson was needed and how it would all fit into their overall lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved him even more for his patience with her questions and helping her understand why he was doing certain things . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t expected that of her and his explanations eased several of her largest worries . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t feel like she was losing her boys but instead , she felt like a part of their lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] after they finished with their nanny , they would eagerly run to her and s ##nu ##ggle with her while telling her all of the amazing things they ' d learned during the day . [SEP]
[CLS] there was also a very efficient housekeeper who kept the entire house immaculate ##ly clean , expert ##ly lau ##nder ##ed and pressed their clothes and also made sure that there was a nut ##rit ##ious dinner on the table when it was time to eat , with lots of vegetables snuck into the meal . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys had no idea that , along with their mac ##aro ##ni and cheese , they were also getting loads of to ##fu and ca ##uli ##flower . [SEP]
[CLS] their pancakes were loaded with carrot ##s and zu ##cchi ##ni and so many other nut ##rit ##ious foods , that even sir ##i was n ' t sure what was in them . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i loved the food and the boys thought it tasted better than the original . [SEP]
[CLS] go figure , she thought one night when the boys dev ##oured a meal with hidden bro ##cco ##li . [SEP]
[CLS] malik walked into the house and sir ##i ' s heart swelled with love for the man when she noticed his eyes immediately looking for her , and then noticed his shoulders relaxing when he found her in the front room , obviously waiting for him . [SEP]
[CLS] his long legs quickly dev ##oured the space between the front door and where she was standing so when malik reached her , she was already bracing for his kiss , and the shivers that sent her body into over ##drive . [SEP]
[CLS] some day , she hoped to grow used to his warm touch . [SEP]
[CLS] it was still such a shock to her system whenever he came close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have some bad news , ' ' he replied and looked down into her now worried eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to fly back to dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to pa ##ve the way for the boys to be accepted as my sons . [SEP]
[CLS] but it wo n ' t be a difficult trip , i promise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that made her stomach clench with fear . [SEP]
[CLS] back to dub ##an ? [SEP]
[CLS] he had n ' t been her long enough this time ! [SEP]
[CLS] her mind flew back to the last time he ' d left her and she could n ' t rep ##ress the fear that well ##ed up inside of her at the idea of losing him once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that going to be a contentious trip ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve already sent dna samples back from their hair and i ' ve openly declared them to be my sons . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s just a formal ##ity now . [SEP]
[CLS] and some legal issues that need to be finalized . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i stepped back out of his arms , a cold terror coming over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when do you have to leave ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , not wanting to hear the answer , wishing he could just stay here with them , never going back to the country that had taken him away from her before . [SEP]
[CLS] she was being selfish , but could n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost like she ' d lost him already . [SEP]
[CLS] he could see the fear and withdrawal in her eyes and was n ' t sure how to reassure her . [SEP]
[CLS] he suspected that the only way to get her to trust him was to follow through with his promise to bring all three of them back with him once these legal ##ities were finalized . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tonight , unfortunately . [SEP]
[CLS] the sooner i leave , the faster i can get this cleared up and come back to get the three of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had heard these words before . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen the worried look on his face that last time as well . [SEP]
[CLS] it had all happened four years ago and she hated the idea of him leaving them . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something wrong and he was n ' t telling her what it was . [SEP]
[CLS] just like the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] and four years ago , he ' d gone home and ended up married to another woman . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' d better get things cleared up then , ' ' she said with as much e ##qua ##ni ##mity as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew something was wrong , but she also knew that he kept things close to his chest , dealing with the problems and leaving her out of it . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought he was trying to protect her but he was only frightening her more by leaving her out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll hurry back , ' ' he said and started to pull her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i stepped back , not willing to let him touch her when she knew something was n ' t right . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you when you get back , ' ' she replied , crossing her arms over her chest and looking away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t have to worry about anything , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys are taken care of and i wo n ' t abandon you again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him , but could n ' t reach his eyes , stopping at his chin instead . [SEP]
[CLS] that was as far she ' d go under the circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] she forced her face to mimic a smile , but she knew she was pretty short of the mark . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good luck , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] a part of her was already packing up their clothes , getting ready to move back into her little cottage which she ' d never given up even though he ' d tried to convince her to sell the house so he could invest the money for her . [SEP]
[CLS] part of her had always known that it would come to this . [SEP]
[CLS] her sons were her life and she would n ' t let them be hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] not even by their father . [SEP]
[CLS] which was why she ' d held on to their previous home , needing the security of her cottage to feel more in control in case anything might happen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have a good trip , ' ' she said with final ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] malik watched her carefully , trying to understand what was going on in her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted so badly to convince her to marry him but he could n ' t figure out why she was pulling away so suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] he had a large diamond ring in his pocket that he ' d been carrying around for several days , wanting to see it on her finger , to know that she was his and only his . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted visible evidence of her commitment to him , but the time had never seemed right recently . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d hoped to put it on her finger tonight , wanting her promise to him before he went back to dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d already told his advisors of his intent to marry sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] they knew about his sons and were thrilled that the question of his marriage and heir was resolved . [SEP]
[CLS] all of them were completely on board with his plans and excited about meeting jacob and samuel , although they ' d tried to convince malik to change their names to something more traditional . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d only laughed and over ##rod ##e their requests . [SEP]
[CLS] now he had to finish up a few details and then they ' d be his family , officially and ir ##re ##vo ##ca ##bly . [SEP]
[CLS] so what was holding her back ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d come willingly into his arms every night for the past week . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been more passionate than before , demanding all of him and not holding anything back herself . [SEP]
[CLS] and he ' d been more than willing to give it to her , thrilled that the woman he remembered was so passionate and sexy . [SEP]
[CLS] damn he wanted her in his arms right now , he wanted to bury himself in her one more time , just to feel her heat wrapping around him and one more chance to show her that they were perfect together . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d thought he ' d loved her before , but that was nothing compared to how he felt about her now . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t imagine life without her now . [SEP]
[CLS] she and the boys were such an integral part of his world already and he wanted to bring them all back immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] he resented the legal issues he needed to resolve before bringing his family to his home but it was just one more of the obligations he faced as leader of dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , he bent down and kissed the boys , closing his eyes and holding them both close to him and enjoying their enthusiastic hugs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see both of you soon , ' ' he said with emphasis . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t drive your mother crazy ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i have a question for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked , his chu ##bby hands touching malik ' s cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then ask your mother if you can call me . [SEP]
[CLS] or you can text me anytime you want and i ' ll get back to you with an answer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob seemed concerned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if we do n ' t agree with your answer ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested , his eyebrows drawn together over his worried eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we might need to understand more or . . . . ' ' malik instantly understood that they were n ' t concerned with questions , they were more concerned with when they were going to see him again , but their todd ##ler minds were wrapping around a more pressing issue instead . [SEP]
[CLS] he did his best to reassure them , squeezing them gently to show them that he understood their worries . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then we ' ll discuss any questions or disagreements you have as soon as i can give you a call back . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' ll make sure that my advisors know that you three have top priority in my daily schedule so they wo n ' t turn away any messages you might have , no matter how small . [SEP]
[CLS] okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob considered this and finally nodded his head in agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` deal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he even stuck his little hand out to shake it but malik chuckled and pulled him into his arms for another hug . [SEP]
[CLS] samuel went right along with malik and jacob , smiling over malik ' s shoulder as he enjoyed his hug from their newly discovered father . [SEP]
[CLS] standing up , he looked at sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to hug her , to kiss her and make her cl ##ing to him like she had during the previous several nights . [SEP]
[CLS] but her body language was clearly shouting for him to leave her alone . [SEP]
[CLS] he started to walk away , trying hard to respect her over ##t signals for space . [SEP]
[CLS] but he only took a few steps before he stopped , cursed under his breath and spun around . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked over to her and pulled her stiff body into his arms , kissing her and running his hands over all of her secret places only he knew about until she softened and kissed him back . [SEP]
[CLS] and even then , he continued for several more minutes , enjoying her soft sighs and little moans she had no idea she actually made when he kissed her he did n ' t stop until he heard sam and jacob giggle off to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] only then did he lift his head and look down into her soft , beautiful features and nod his head in approval . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s better , ' ' he declared . [SEP]
[CLS] with one more peck , he turned around and headed back out the door , determined to get the business out of the way so he could officially bring them all back to dub ##an and marry that annoying , confusing , beautiful and sexy woman . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted everyone to know that she was his woman and they could n ' t touch her for any reason . [SEP]
[CLS] and his boys were the most amazing little creatures . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never known that boys could be so fascinating and curious and interesting to talk to . [SEP]
[CLS] he never tired of their questions , continuously fascinated by how their minds processed their world . [SEP]
[CLS] he had obligations though and he had to focus on those in order to make his family whole again . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never allow anything to get in the way of his world like it had four years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew now that he should have done things differently in the past , not given in to his father ' s pressure and found a better way to solve the problems of the country rather than marry his ex - wife . [SEP]
[CLS] with determination , he slipped into the back of the limousine and ordered his driver to get him to the airport in half the time . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , he did n ' t even care if he broke the traffic laws . [SEP]
[CLS] he just wanted to be back here as fast as possible so he could take his family home and make that woman his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted the world to know that she was his and no one could mess with her . [SEP]
[CLS] and he wanted to know that she would be in his bed every night with her warm smile and gentle heart . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i watched with a sinking feeling as the beautiful limousine quickly pulled away , the back tires ski ##dding as the driver sped away from the house as fast as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t understand malik ' s motivation today and she really did n ' t understand why he was so frantic to get away from them . [SEP]
[CLS] she would have sworn that he loved being with the boys , and she definitely enjoyed having him around , even though she ' d fought it hard at first . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , he never hesitated to pull her into his strong , secure arms , but maybe she again was just a convenient outlet for his desires . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was certainly passionate . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps he saw the boys as an unexpected obligation on top of so many others he was constantly burden ##ed with . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe he just had sex with her as a way to secure her feelings towards him so he could claim the boys as his own . [SEP]
[CLS] no , she did n ' t think that was the case . [SEP]
[CLS] he was too sol ##ici ##tou ##s of her opinion and seemed to genuinely want her advice or perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] if he were going to take the boys away , she suspected he would start to pull away from asking her opinion versus increasing her involvement . [SEP]
[CLS] not that she would let him , anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] as she stood there by the window , the tail lights of his vehicle slowly fading away , her heart felt like it was a lead brick , and sunk further into her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t she figure this man out ? [SEP]
[CLS] why was he so complicated ? [SEP]
[CLS] and why , why , why did she have to fall in love with a man like him ? [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t she have fallen for someone normal and boring ? [SEP]
[CLS] someone who would n ' t have to fly halfway around the world just to reach his home ? [SEP]
[CLS] there were wonderful men , probably right down the street ? [SEP]
[CLS] what was it about malik that she just thought was so special ? [SEP]
[CLS] she heard the boys in the background and pulled her worried eyes away from the large , sunny window . [SEP]
[CLS] there was n ' t anything to see anymore so it was pointless now . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the middle of the afternoon and she had several urgent issues still to final ##ize at work . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have time to think about malik and why he did n ' t want to be around them . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought her boys were pretty amazing so it was his fault that he did n ' t want to experience each day with them . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i picked up both of her excited boys and gave them each a hug and a kiss , then headed into the office malik had set up for her to work in . [SEP]
[CLS] this was definitely nice of him , she thought as she rounded her beautiful , shiny wooden desk that was absolutely perfect for her needs . [SEP]
[CLS] lots of drawers , a wide area for her computer and monitor not to mention a state of the art sound system that allowed her to play whatever music suited her mood . [SEP]
[CLS] he was definitely generous , she ' d give him that . [SEP]
[CLS] but to what end ? [SEP]
[CLS] she fingered the files she needed to work on while she puzzled through possible scenarios , but in the end , she could n ' t guess what malik ' s end game was , other than taking her boys from her , which she absolutely would not allow ! [SEP]
[CLS] the boys would be finishing up their afternoon classes with the nanny soon and she no longer had to worry about dinner , which was a glorious freedom since she sincerely disliked cooking . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe she could take the boys to the playground for a while , get their minds off of malik ' s departure . [SEP]
[CLS] they had n ' t been outside in the sunshine very much lately due to a more rigorous school schedule and several rainy days , so this would be a nice change . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t mind the increased lessons since the boys were absolutely loving the additional information , sucking up any new lesson like little sponge ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked down at her cl ##uttered desk and gritted her teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] she would have to focus if she wanted to get all these issues resolved in time . [SEP]
[CLS] she worked steadily through the rest of the afternoon , resolving several outstanding problems by refusing to let her mind wander , especially to try and figure out malik ' s motivation . [SEP]
[CLS] she worked hard until the boys came running into her office . [SEP]
[CLS] she then determined ##ly shut down her work computer and gathered up all the play stuff they would need in order to have a good time at the playground . [SEP]
[CLS] playing out in the sunshine , running along the green grass with rover and boy while they chased balls , pushing jacob and samuel on the swing and laughing as they raced up the ladder for the slide was exactly what she needed to get her mind off of the de ##pressing events of the afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] these two boys were the right anti ##dote for any kind of depression she thought as the three of them walked back to the car hand in hand , the boys chatter ##ing about their ram ##bu ##nc ##tious activities while the dogs kept reaching up to lick a cheek or nu ##dge a hand for some attention . [SEP]
[CLS] the next few days followed the same pattern and sir ##i was amazed at how well they worked their days around their new schedule without malik . [SEP]
[CLS] if she had to force herself to focus at times during the afternoon because she caught herself fan ##tas ##izing about a tall , handsome she ##ik who was missing , she ' d just push herself harder to get more done . [SEP]
[CLS] the only exception to their routine was when malik called each night . [SEP]
[CLS] they boys loved talking with him , telling him all that they ' d learned with their new nanny that day and asking him questions to show her the following day that they were on top of their lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] her teachings were filled with various animals , different countries of the world , cultures and sir ##i was amazed at how the woman snuck in geography , all of which the boys just loved , their little minds grasping concepts that others would n ' t probably understand until they were much older . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so emotionally distraught over malik ' s departure that by the time his phone call arrived , she was barely able to tuck the boys into bed before she fell asleep herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to stay up later and talk with malik , to ask him questions and find out how things were going in dub ##an or just finish up her own work , possibly get ahead of the curve that she ' d felt she ' d been under lately . [SEP]
[CLS] but she could barely keep her eyes open , the emotional stress wearing her down . [SEP]
[CLS] one night when he called , she ' d just tucked the boys into bed and brushed her own teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] she was climbing into bed when her phone rang and she instinctively knew it would be him even though this was n ' t the time he generally called her in the evenings . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to smile , but she was so painfully tired she could barely press the button to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his voice strong and vibrant and sir ##i was jealous that he could be so wide awake while she continued to feel so painfully exhausted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tired , ' ' she claimed and yawned so she could n ' t say anything more . [SEP]
[CLS] he hesitated while she finished her ya ##wn before continuing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what did you do today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his voice br ##us ##que as he tried to determine why she was pushing him away . [SEP]
[CLS] each phone call was becoming shorter and shorter . [SEP]
[CLS] she claimed exhaustion , but he ' d seen her running her business and running after those two boys before and she had n ' t acted like this at that point . [SEP]
[CLS] something was wrong , he thought as he tried to come up with something that would inspire conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i thought his tone was becoming impatient , but she was n ' t able to focus enough to make a determination . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , we received several large orders at the office and had to rush the distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] so it ' s been a good week so far . [SEP]
[CLS] what about you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and closed her eyes , curling up in the bed they ' d shared for just over a week before he ' d left . [SEP]
[CLS] had it only been two weeks since he ' d come back into their lives ? [SEP]
[CLS] so much had happened , her whole life was different now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what about you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and snuggled down into the large pillows that were placed behind her on the bed . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a decade ##nt feeling to slide into a bed that she had n ' t made earlier in the day . [SEP]
[CLS] she still was n ' t used to someone taking care of the house for her , but it was definitely something she could enjoy while it lasted . [SEP]
[CLS] he started to talk , but she kept ya ##wn ##ing so she only heard about half of what he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds good , ' ' she replied , but was n ' t really sure if anything he ' d said was good , bad or horrible . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a long pause and malik finally asked , ` ` sir ##i , are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' she replied , sm ##oth ##ering another ya ##wn . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do you ask ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you seem a bit stand ##off ##ish . [SEP]
[CLS] i want the old sir ##i back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she should be angry at his comment , but she was just too tired . [SEP]
[CLS] she snuggled deeper into the pillows , pulling a soft , fluffy blanket over her legs because it was just too much effort to get under the covers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not sure why i ' m so tired . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not normally like this , am i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she heard the frustration come through the phone with his tone and tried to sit up , but the pillows were just too comfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe it ' s the weather . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are things going over where you are ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying to sound more upbeat , but it was a huge effort to just form the words . [SEP]
[CLS] all she wanted to do was close her eyes and fall asleep , not to be disturbed for about ten hours . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` things could be better , ' ' he said with a deep sigh . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought about the petty sq ##ua ##bble ##s his advisors were having about his wedding to sir ##i and stifled his irritation since it was n ' t productive . [SEP]
[CLS] some wanted a huge affair that would take months to coordinate ; others wanted a fast event that would show the world that they accepted his new wife une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] either way , the wedding was going to happen and they were all excited about welcoming sir ##i and the boys into their world and helping them to ass ##imi ##late into the dub ##an culture . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just taking longer than anticipated to temper their excitement and get down to the details . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s lots of arguing and ridiculous things to work out . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ' ll get there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] something in his tone alerted her to a problem and she rouse ##d herself enough to ask , ` ` i thought you ' d be back by now . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope things are n ' t going poorly . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s no question about the boys , are there ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he heard the worry in her tone and wanted to reassure her quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` none at all . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone is thrilled that an heir is already in place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled as he said , ` ` they were worried about my vi ##ril ##ity , if you can believe it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had to laugh at that and it felt good . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been so tired and tense lately that even the smallest laugh felt wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can at ##test to your . . . . abilities , if they have any questions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled at her teasing choice of words , some of the tension leaving him as he heard her laughter once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like you to be testing my abilities right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] no little hare ##m women hanging about to entertain you ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] she joked , but the idea of him having a hare ##m was extremely painful . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re my only hare ##m woman . [SEP]
[CLS] and i can guarantee that you ' ll be dressing up for me in some sexy , ski ##mp ##y outfit with lots of scar ##ves that i ' ll rip off that lu ##sc ##ious body of yours . [SEP]
[CLS] you will definitely be entertaining me when you get here . [SEP]
[CLS] i need lots and lots of your special brand of entertaining . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said it with that sexy , deep voice of his that never failed to make her stomach do a flip flop . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as long as i can entertain you my way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any way you want will be fine with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if i want to watch television ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she teased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you ' ll be watching television while i ravi ##sh your body ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growled . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i laughed and then sm ##oth ##ered another ya ##wn . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re falling asleep on me . [SEP]
[CLS] am i that un ##int ##eres ##ting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help but laugh again . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the teasing , not used to this from him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was usually so stern and off ##icio ##us unless he was playing with the boys . [SEP]
[CLS] but even then , he took all of their questions so seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] she really liked this new side of malik . [SEP]
[CLS] it made him much more human and approach ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so when are you coming back ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as soon as i can come back and bring the three of you back here . [SEP]
[CLS] there are just a few more details that need to be worked out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] all the tension came right back and she rolled over to stare out into the darkness of her bedroom windows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` any details i need to be aware of ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing really . [SEP]
[CLS] just irritating arguments that do n ' t make any sense in the larger sense of this situation . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i did n ' t like being referred to as a ` ` situation ' ' . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to be the center of his life and to make him happy the way he always did for her and the boys as soon as he walked into a room . [SEP]
[CLS] being referred to as a ' situation ' sounded bad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' ll let you go so that you can resolve those situations , ' ' she replied tar ##tly . [SEP]
[CLS] her fatigue was really starting to get to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sorry . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just tired . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll talk to you later , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] sleep well , ' ' he replied , sm ##oth ##ering his frustration , and hung up the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i turned off her own phone then slid down into the soft , silky sheets , tears coming down her cheeks as she thought about all the things she really wanted to say to malik , but had n ' t had the courage . [SEP]
[CLS] and none of those things had to do with television , situations , politics or arguments with his advisors , which were probably about her and what a prom ##is ##cu ##ous woman she was to have had children out of wed ##lock . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d heard about these men and how they viewed women . [SEP]
[CLS] they were probably trying to think of some way to get the boys without the mom . [SEP]
[CLS] she fell asleep vow ##ing that she ' d never let anyone take her children away from her . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 10 half a world away , malik angrily walked down the long , ornate hallway , not aware of any of the elaborate decor that surrounded him in the magnificent palace , or the ancient history of the structure . [SEP]
[CLS] all he cared about was getting back to sir ##i and the boys , of bringing them here so they could be a family without all the silly issues to deal with . [SEP]
[CLS] last night ' s call to sir ##i had disturbed him and he worried that she was changing her mind about coming to live with him . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to marry her , he had to have her in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no other woman who suited him like she did and he would n ' t allow anything more to slow this wedding down . [SEP]
[CLS] no more conversations about the best way to bring his family home and how she might or might not take any ina ##d ##vert ##ent slight if the ceremony went one way or another . [SEP]
[CLS] he was disgusted that he ' d allowed the debates to go on this long when the woman he loved was too far away for him to care for and protect , much less understand . [SEP]
[CLS] it was past time he put his foot down and firmly explained how this wedding was going to move forward . [SEP]
[CLS] better to leave them out of his marriage now since he would n ' t allow any of their interference later on . [SEP]
[CLS] his personal life was no longer a topic for debate . [SEP]
[CLS] inside his council house , his advisors were already assembled , all of them excitedly discussing their ideas for his wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as he walked in , silence descended . [SEP]
[CLS] he sat down and glared at the men along each side of the table , ensuring that each of them understood his frustration ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i spoke to sir ##i last night and this is what i ' m going to do . . . ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] not a single person argued with him and within an hour , all of them stood up to carry out their leader ' s orders , eager to welcome their queen and future kings . [SEP]
[CLS] not another argument , not even a suggestion . [SEP]
[CLS] when malik spoke , they followed . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d led their country out of a potentially violent civil war with very little blood ##shed , had united their tribes and had demonstrated that , through his leadership , their country could be a powerhouse in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] they would follow him through hell if he requested it and now all of them wanted to be able to say that they had helped to bring his bride to their she ##ik ' s home . [SEP]
[CLS] five hours later , malik was on his private plane , flying back to sir ##i and his sons , the only indication that he was concerned was the blank expression on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] the more serious the expression , the grave ##r the issues he was facing . [SEP]
[CLS] right now , with the thought of losing sir ##i , his face was a complete , blank mask . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i laughed as jacob climbed up on her lap and gave her a sloppy kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what was that for ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , pulling him close for a hug . [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged and snuggled into her lap , making himself comfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you seemed sad . [SEP]
[CLS] you always give me a kiss when i ' m sad so i gave one back ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned up at her as if he ' d worked through something miraculous . [SEP]
[CLS] and in a way , he had done exactly that . [SEP]
[CLS] he was sweet and wonderful and she ' d been st ##omp ##ing around in a gr ##ump ##y mood for the past two days . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted malik back , but not if he did n ' t want them . [SEP]
[CLS] and they were a package deal . [SEP]
[CLS] no separation , no sporadic visits . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t losing her kids ! [SEP]
[CLS] and if he wanted her , he ' d better prove it because she was n ' t feeling it lately . [SEP]
[CLS] she was only feeling tired and exhausted and just plain old gr ##ump ##y and mean . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you think daddy will be back today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sam asked , climbing up onto the other side of her lap , pushing his brother out of the way to make room for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t know honey . [SEP]
[CLS] we need to give daddy some time to work through the issues he has to face . [SEP]
[CLS] we ca n ' t pressure him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jacob sat up and looked out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he ' s home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he called out and cl ##ums ##ily scrambled off of her lap . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i looked out the window , wondering what he ' d seen that would make him jump up like that . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , sam was quick to follow his brother and both little guys were out of the room like bullets ! [SEP]
[CLS] they raced through the house and pulled open the front door . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i was right behind them , but she could barely catch her breath for some reason and her two guys were out the front door before she could stop them . [SEP]
[CLS] she was terrified that , in their ex ##uber ##ance to see malik , they would run out in front of the vehicle and be hurt . [SEP]
[CLS] but she should have known better . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as she reached the front door , she looked out and the body guard who had been standing sent ##ry by the front door was holding sam under his right arm and jacob under the left , both of whom were grinning from ear to ear as they watched the long , black car pull up in front of the house . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i bit her lip as malik got out of the car . [SEP]
[CLS] she was worried that he would be angry with them for running out of the house but it was really her fault for not being fast enough with them . [SEP]
[CLS] and she had n ' t locked the front door like she normally did , even going so far as to have a lock installed on the top of the door just for this kind of instance . [SEP]
[CLS] they were fast and getting faster , so she had to ensure their safety . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was my fault malik , ' ' she quickly intercepted him , trying to keep him from sc ##old ##ing the boys . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s your fault ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked as he looked down at both boys who were at his feet , grabbing his leg on both sides and demanding that they be recognized as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they both cried out , wig ##gling in an effort to be lifted into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] malik did n ' t hesitate . [SEP]
[CLS] he bent down and lifted both into his strong arms , nu ##zzling each on their little necks until they were giggling bundles of movement and happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have both of you been mind ##ing your manners ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and nodded when they told him that they had been very good . [SEP]
[CLS] malik turned to the guard who had caught them and nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , the guard bowed deeply and sir ##i was shocked to see evidence that malik really was a king . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d said that her boys were princes , but she had n ' t made the leap that he was also royalty . [SEP]
[CLS] good grief , she thought , she had so much to learn . [SEP]
[CLS] or maybe she did n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked back at him warily , bracing herself for whatever news he might be bringing . [SEP]
[CLS] was he here to tell her that he was heading back alone ? [SEP]
[CLS] she had to be prepared for anything with this man . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d gone through hell the last time . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t be mentally un ##pre ##par ##ed again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked as he carried the boys into the house . [SEP]
[CLS] malik looked at her carefully , noticing the dark circles under her eyes and the fatigue that made her shoulders dr ##oop with exhaustion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look tired . [SEP]
[CLS] did you not sleep well last night ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked gently as they entered the house . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you eating okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was actually irritated that he would ask something so ridiculous . [SEP]
[CLS] she was a grown woman . [SEP]
[CLS] what business was it of his if she ate well or decided on pizza morning , noon and night ? [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her tongue though , not wanting his homecoming to be marred by her bad mood . [SEP]
[CLS] malik looked down at the boys . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you mind if i had a private word with your mother ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , but his voice was firm , indicating that it was n ' t a request . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go find laura and see if she can dig up some information on crocodile ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i bet i can come up with more facts about them than you can , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys both looked up at him , their eyes wide with excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` crocodile ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they echoed . [SEP]
[CLS] comical ##ly , sam and jacob looked directly at each other , then back up at their father , then the two of them raced out of the living room as fast as their little legs would carry them . [SEP]
[CLS] when both of them were out of ear shot , he turned back to sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his hands on his hips as he glared down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me you ' re not married , ' ' she whispered , the fear almost choking her . [SEP]
[CLS] at her question , malik finally understood what she ' d been thinking these past few days and his body relaxed . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her closer , his arms wrapping around her stiff body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not married . [SEP]
[CLS] yet . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shoved out of his arms and glared up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] if you tell me that you ' re engaged to another woman , so help me malik . . . ' ' ` ` i ' m engaged to you , sir ##i . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his voice was soft , but firm , not trying to tease her in any way because he finally understood why she had been so stressed while he was away . [SEP]
[CLS] those were n ' t the words she was expecting to hear so when he said them like that , just as a statement of fact as if it were a fai ##t acc ##omp ##li , she could only stand there in front of him in stunned silence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re engaged ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered , too afraid of believing him . [SEP]
[CLS] had she misunderstood ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re engaged . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re getting married the day after we arrive in dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to . . . . ' ' she interrupted him by raising her hand to stop him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hold that thought , ' ' she said and quickly ran out of the room and into the powder room off the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so embarrassed when she slammed the door shut and then emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet , heaving over and over again . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was finished , she felt a cold towel press against her forehead and she slid against the wall , grateful for the support . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said quietly and closed her eyes , waiting for the wave of nausea to ease . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` were you that worried about what was going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked gently as he knelt down in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about it for a few moments , and then nodded her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was terrified to read the newspapers and i would n ' t even log onto the internet , afraid i might see something . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s how i found out about your first marriage . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he picked her up and carried her to the sofa in the living room , holding her there while she laid her head on his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] she was too weak from the bout of nausea to fight him . [SEP]
[CLS] and by now , she did n ' t want to . [SEP]
[CLS] the words , ` ` i ' m engaged to you , sir ##i ' ' kept running through her mind , a dream that was too precious to believe in yet . [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded his head as well and pulled her close , his fingers tang ##ling in her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you have n ' t wanted to hear an explanation , but i think it ' s time we finally talked about what happened so you can understand why i got married that weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to assure you first off that it was n ' t my choice and if i could have done things differently , i would have . [SEP]
[CLS] i loved you back then , but i ' d been with you so much during the time we were together , i ' d become out of touch with what was happening at home . [SEP]
[CLS] i went home that weekend and was told about an uprising in the north of my country . [SEP]
[CLS] my father was furious that he was being cornered in that way and ordered me to marry the daughter of the tribal leader who had ins ##ti ##gated the rebellion . [SEP]
[CLS] she and i met for the first time the same day we were married . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i ' s whole body tensed , but that brought back the nausea so she forced herself to relax back against his warm chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so you were n ' t engaged before then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was never engaged to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ever ! [SEP]
[CLS] i only wanted to marry you . [SEP]
[CLS] please believe me , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] you have been the only woman i ' ve ever loved and even my ex - wife knew that i was n ' t emotionally involved with the relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t the cause of the breakup , but it definitely did n ' t help . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her pale face , confused by her question . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t i what ? [SEP]
[CLS] love her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even bother to shake her head , afraid of the consequences to her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] why did n ' t you marry me four years ago ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t sure how you felt about me . [SEP]
[CLS] you were still in school , so smart and beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] you had so many plans for what you wanted to do with your education and marrying me would take all of that away . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted you to be happy more than i wanted to marry you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t look up at him , but she snuggled against him more , her nose pressed to his warm neck and smelling his wonderful scent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` honey , you ca n ' t have a career and be married to me . [SEP]
[CLS] i wish it were otherwise , but there are too many obligations . [SEP]
[CLS] especially in the business you ' re in , there would be implications of favor ##itis ##m . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean someone would try and buy my favors by going through my company to order their toys ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about that for all of two seconds . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll sell it off . [SEP]
[CLS] i know exactly who should have first chance at it too , ' ' she said , thinking of joe and his efficiency , his dedication . [SEP]
[CLS] malik looked down at her , trying to determine if he understood her correctly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you saying that you ' re willing to give up all that you ' ve worked for to be my wife ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve done the career part , malik . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath and forged on , determined to be brave and honest with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i did n ' t like life without you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hated being married to that woman , sir ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re the only woman i ever wanted by my side . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you marry her then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my father ordered it . [SEP]
[CLS] and i did n ' t have time to figure out an alternative before the wedding . [SEP]
[CLS] i was cornered and it took me all this time to work a solution for the tribes in the northern area of the country to get along without the marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] my ex - wife and i both worked hard over the years to make sure that any kind of separation between us would n ' t impact the peace . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a good woman , but not the one for me . [SEP]
[CLS] only you are that woman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ran her fingers over his arm , feeling the hair against his warm skin and loving him even more for all of his dedication . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe your ex - wife was willing to give you up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged and looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was n ' t really into me , ' ' he explained diplomatic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about it for a moment , and came up with the right explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was a lesbian ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so that ' s why you did n ' t have any children with her ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` exactly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she was an idiot , ' ' sir ##i replied , leaning her head against his shoulder weakly . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and squeezed her shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she would have loved you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i smacked his thigh , but there was no force behind her movement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry you were so worried about what was happening , ' ' he finally said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you want to move anywhere ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m fine with you right here , just trying to figure out what ' s going on with you lately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i smiled and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m fine right here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how long is this going to last ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i thought about it for a moment and then tensed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , feeling her body change and becoming alarmed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` malik , remember that first night we were together ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you happen to use a condom ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stilled as he thought back to that night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] hell , ' ' he cursed quietly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it might have broken . [SEP]
[CLS] i was n ' t sure and completely forgot to mention it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and put her hand on his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how soon is the wedding ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as soon as we get back to dub ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] everything is arranged which is what took me so long to get back here . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted everything ready so you could n ' t wig ##gle out of the ceremony . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you mind terribly if we left maybe this afternoon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you telling me . . . ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i think we ' re going to have another little one running around whatever palace you ' re going to make us live in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik picked her up and hugged her gently , careful not to upset her stomach again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you , ' ' he said as he kissed her gently . [SEP]
[CLS] epilogue malik strode down the hallway , his steps eating up the distance between his office and the gymnasium . [SEP]
[CLS] his aide had just whispered in his ear and he was rushing to stop imminent catastrophe . [SEP]
[CLS] he heard their words before he reached the room , but he hurried even faster , wary of any of them demonstrating their skills . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` stop ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he commanded as soon as he entered the room . [SEP]
[CLS] four sets of eyes looked over at him , all of them wary and all wondering why he would be disco ##ura ##ging the use of their combat skills when he ' d taught them so well over the past several years . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dani ##ka , get off jacob immediately , ' ' he said , then turned to see his other two children . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` samuel , you may not put your sister in a head lock ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i rushed into the room , already out of breath herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d obviously received the same message and was here to stop her children from hurting each other as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good grief , ' ' she whispered as she noticed jacob glaring at his younger sister and samuel looking smug as lila brushed herself off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik turned so his back was facing his four children . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way , sir ##i was the only one to see his amusement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` our children decided they were ready for real combat and thought they should fight to the death here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i glanced around , her mouth hanging open slightly in horror . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dani ##ka ! [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re three years old ! [SEP]
[CLS] you can not fight to the death at three years old ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] dani ##ka hum ##ph ##ed and looked at her sister who was a year older . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lila started it . [SEP]
[CLS] samuel said he knew more than she did so he said he could win . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik ' s shoulders shook and she glared back at him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re actually to blame for this ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped at him , her hands on her hips , not app ##re ##cia ##ting any of his amusement when her children were about to harm each other . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head and approached her slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how am i to blame ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the one who taught them all their moves . [SEP]
[CLS] and gave them the confidence to believe they could actually fight to the death ! [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t even try that innocent look with me . [SEP]
[CLS] you know exactly what you ' ve done . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] malik turned back to his children , keeping a stern expression on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t ever want to hear any of you joking about fighting to the death with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] your combat skills are only for emergency and protective situations . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were n ' t really going to fight to the death , dad , ' ' jacob said as he stood up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we only wanted to teach them a lesson . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m the only one who can teach this . [SEP]
[CLS] now go back to your studies and do n ' t let me find you in here again without supervision . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] all four children stood at attention and bowed , app ##re ##cia ##ting that they were supposed to respect their black belt master before exiting any room . [SEP]
[CLS] sir ##i had to sm ##oth ##er her own smile as she watched their efforts , knowing that jacob and samuel would never hurt their sisters . [SEP]
[CLS] they were overly protective of them as it is , but she ' d panicked when she heard the message and was only now realizing how silly her fears had been . [SEP]
[CLS] even dani ##ka and lila would n ' t do anything to hurt their brothers , thinking the boys walked on water . [SEP]
[CLS] as she watched , jacob elbow ##ed dani ##ka , whispering that she ' d done a good job . [SEP]
[CLS] and samuel was holding lila ' s hand as he led her out of the gym . [SEP]
[CLS] all was well with her growing family and she sent up a silent prayer of gratitude for all of the wonderful gifts she ' d received . [SEP]
[CLS] malik walked over and put his hand on sir ##i ' s growing stomach , waiting to see if he could feel his next child move for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are you feeling ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked gently . [SEP]
[CLS] she chuckled and moved to one of the benches to sit down , accepting malik ' s assistance as she carefully lowered her pregnant bulk down . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d feel a whole lot better if my children were n ' t so competitive . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and sat down beside her , leaning against the wall as he released the tension that had accumulated after he ' d received the message that his children were fighting each other . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re beautiful , you know , ' ' he said and took her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re pretty handsome yourself , ' ' she came back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled and moved closer , putting his arm around her protective ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you can say that after what we just witnessed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve given me so much , including those little hell ##ions , ' ' she sighed and pressed her cheek against his chest as he pulled her close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love you for all the little things you ' ve done for me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like to give you more jewelry , ' ' he commented , noting that she was n ' t wearing any gold or diamonds with her blue dress that draped over her beautifully pregnant figure . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve given me something better than jewels , ' ' she came back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve given me treasures beyond measure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at the woman he ' d loved for so many years and smiled . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve given me a great deal as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 1 ` ` dad , i just do n ' t think . . . ' ' rachel stuart started to say . [SEP]
[CLS] her father gently interrupted her before she could come up with an excuse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t say you do n ' t have the time . [SEP]
[CLS] i guarantee you wo n ' t regret this . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel bit her lip , wondering how she could say no to her father . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew he was lonely , but . . . ` ` he ' s not here , honey . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] john stuart said the words softly , but her heart ached that her father knew . [SEP]
[CLS] she closed her eyes and took a deep , cleansing breath as the pain of her last visit to the farm swept through her . [SEP]
[CLS] she slowly let the air out of her lungs and straightened her shoulders , not willing to reveal too much even to her father . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t care if he ' s there or not dad . [SEP]
[CLS] this has nothing to . . . ' ' ` ` ra ##ch ' , do n ' t even try it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he softly interrupted her comment , knowing where this conversation would go if he allowed it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your old dad knows what ' s going on and i feel for you . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s is n ' t scheduled to arrive until late tomorrow afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] so if you do n ' t come out tonight , then you ' re not going to be able to see these beau ##ties for another month and i know you ' re go ##n na love these guys . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ' beau ##ties ' ? [SEP]
[CLS] did that mean that new horses had arrived on the farm ? [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he ' d pi ##que ##d her interest with that comment and she hesitated only briefly because if there was one thing in this world she loved besides her father it was horses . [SEP]
[CLS] and she was relieved that the man in question was n ' t scheduled to arrive until the following day . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what is it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , trying to hide her curiosity but failing because whatever her father was calling about had to be big . [SEP]
[CLS] his relieved laughter flowed through the phone lines , knowing that he ' d gotten her with those words . [SEP]
[CLS] if there was one thing rachel hated it was to not know a secret . [SEP]
[CLS] he tormented her with christmas and birthday presents , and any surprises he could think of throughout the year just to tease her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come out for dinner tonight and you ' ll see . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he waited a moment before he said , ` ` i ' ll make you mac ##aro ##ni and cheese , ' ' he said with a hopeful tone . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d hit her weak point , damn him . [SEP]
[CLS] she closed her eyes , her hand gripping her cell phone as if she could find strength . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` with the go ##rgo ##nzo ##la cheese ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you bet , ' ' he laughed again , knowing that she was caught now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you at six o ' clock . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t be late or i start eating it myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she groaned and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he knew exactly how to lure her home for a visit . [SEP]
[CLS] his mac ##aro ##ni and cheese was the best with go ##rgo ##nzo ##la cheese and chi ##ves . [SEP]
[CLS] the man did n ' t stop there . [SEP]
[CLS] he added secret ingredients he would n ' t even give her a hint about so that she could n ' t figure out how to make it herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d tried , just so she did n ' t have to risk running into the man in question , but she had n ' t come close and he was using that as her compensation for the risk involved in coming home . [SEP]
[CLS] after disco ##nne ##cting , she stared at her computer screen , her eyes not really seeing anything . [SEP]
[CLS] her father knew , she thought with resignation and more than a little embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t a stupid man , so it was ridiculous of her to think that he had n ' t noticed her reaction to the man over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] but it would have been nice if it had just been her secret . [SEP]
[CLS] with resignation and embarrassment , she accepted that there were just some things a daughter could n ' t hide from her dad . [SEP]
[CLS] three hours later , she shut down her laptop and packed up her office , forcing a smile as she walked out of the building so her co - workers did n ' t know she felt like she was facing a death squad . [SEP]
[CLS] she usually timed these things better but she ' d already committed to the visit . [SEP]
[CLS] coming out tonight was cutting things a bit closer than she preferred . [SEP]
[CLS] it took her two hours with heavy traffic because she worked in downtown washington , d . c . and her father lived out west of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] it felt as if everyone and their brother were heading out west along interstate 66 so there were long periods when she was crawling in traffic , and those were the good moments . [SEP]
[CLS] there were other times when she just sat there , the autumn sunshine beating through her window while traffic came to a stands ##till . [SEP]
[CLS] this was why she used public transportation , she thought with frustration as she pulled her jacket off during one of the many sitting spells . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , there was n ' t any way to get all the way out to the farm on public transit so she had to drive herself , inch ##ing along in rush hour traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally pulled up behind the stables , she was hot , miserable , irritated and painfully hungry . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked into her father ' s cottage and dumped her overnight bag by the door , already feeling better once she smelled the mac ##aro ##ni and cheese scent wa ##fting through his small home . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m home ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she called out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you tell me what the surprise is that could n ' t wait another month ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her father stepped out of the kitchen , tossing a dish ##tow ##el over his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] the look in his eyes told her something was very wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` glad you ' re here ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said , a little too loudly , his eyes darting from her to the kitchen , then back again worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dinner is almost ready . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t you go change and i ' ll get everything ready . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel watched her dad carefully , noting the odd look in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did n ' t you mention that you made mac ##aro ##ni and cheese for dinner ? [SEP]
[CLS] i can already smell it so there ' s no need to change . [SEP]
[CLS] i can just dig in . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he hesitated , glancing behind him and rachel peered into the kitchen , wondering what he was trying to see . [SEP]
[CLS] when the tall man emerged from the tiny kitchen , he took her breath away and her body immediately reacted to those dark , penetrating eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he was taller , his shoulders broader and his eyes darker , more dangerous . [SEP]
[CLS] everything about him was just . . . . more . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped at the sight of him , her eyes taking in the overwhelming presence of the man she ' d been avoiding for the past six years . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' d been doing a damn good job if that until tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] her father shuffled around for a moment before he said , ` ` i ' ll just go check on dinner . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and he disappeared into the kitchen , leaving her alone to face her demons . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she breathed , her heart instantly racing , her knees starting to feel weak and wo ##bbly . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe that he was actually here , in her father ' s small cottage . [SEP]
[CLS] it had never felt this tiny before but rai ##s was so large , he actually had to duck between the kitchen doorway leading to the den area so he did n ' t bump his head . [SEP]
[CLS] and shocking ##ly , he had to angle his shoulders to get through the doorway ? [SEP]
[CLS] ridiculous , she thought , trying to pull her eyes away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] it was difficult , but she finally did it . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , her eyes only moved away from his penetrating eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] traveling down his body was just as bad . [SEP]
[CLS] his broad , muscular shoulders tape ##red to slim hips and long legs that she knew were covered with bulging muscles , just like the rest of him . [SEP]
[CLS] the man was the ep ##ito ##me of mas ##cu ##lini ##ty topped off with an aura of confidence that many , many women found fascinating and all ##uring . [SEP]
[CLS] she was not immune to his magnet ##ism either , which was why she ' d tried so hard to avoid visiting her father while he was in residence . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that rai ##s ' father passed away several years ago , so he was now she ##ik rai ##s say ##yi ##d tar ##if za ##man , she ##ik of dun ##ari , she thought in a ridiculous train of thought that left her speechless . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t even tell him to get out since , technically , this was his cottage , his farm and all of the horses out in the stables were his . [SEP]
[CLS] he owned the farm here in virginia so if he wanted to come to his house earlier than anticipated , he could do whatever he pleased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s been a long time , ' ' rai ##s finally broke the silence . [SEP]
[CLS] his deep , husky voice broke through her crazy thoughts , ji ##lt ##ing her mind into over ##drive . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] i guess it has been a few years . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow , smiling slightly as he said , ` ` more like six years , i believe . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned against the wall and slid his hands into the pockets of his immaculate ##ly tailored slacks , those dark , dangerous eyes never leaving her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` one might almost imagine that you have been avoiding me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel flushed and looked down at her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would be silly , ' ' she said , hoping he could n ' t see her cheeks flame up in color with the dim ##mer light in the cottage ' s den area . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how have you been ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , suddenly overcome with the need to straighten the magazines that were scattered all over the coffee table and pick up the newspapers that had been careless ##ly left on the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she was nervous and wished she could just slip out the door and fade back into the darkness of the autumn evening . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled slightly , crossing his arms over that massive chest of his while he watched her nervously straighten up the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been fine . [SEP]
[CLS] why have n ' t you been around ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she picked up and ref ##old ##ed the blanket that she ' d bought for her dad because he fell asleep on the couch so often . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve been pretty busy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` too busy to swing by once in a while to say hello to an old friend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped and froze , wondering how to respond . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him , then away once again , too nervous to hold that contact with his too - knowing gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i know it ' s not very far but , well , you know how traffic is around here . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s hard to get out this way . [SEP]
[CLS] and i do n ' t have . . . well , i ca n ' t really take time off very often . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he moved closer , putting a hand on her shoulder to stop her frantic movements . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she actually jumped and took a step backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not nervous , ' ' she countered but could n ' t look him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath to try and steady herself . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt like she had a bit more control , she said , ` ` why are you here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at his firm chin or his broad shoulders , the middle of his fabulous ##ly muscular chest . . . anywhere but into his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] he put his hands back in his slacks and looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s could n ' t believe the beauty she ' d grown into . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d suspected she would be like this as he ' d watched her grow up and knew that she would be beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] but the woman standing in front of him was stunning . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a cool so ##phi ##stic ##ation that was startling with a sensual ##ity that was soft and seductive instead of being b ##lat ##ant . [SEP]
[CLS] her long , black hair looked like a silk wave as it cascade ##d down her shoulders and her pretty blue eyes revealed so much , but also hid everything he wanted to know . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why have you been avoiding me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he countered in a low voice so her father would n ' t hear them in the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d wanted her for so long , he could n ' t remember a time when he had n ' t ached to hold her in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ever since she ' d turned sixteen , his feelings for rachel had changed from brother ##ly affection and interest to something much stronger , significantly deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] and the older she got , the more intense that feeling had become . [SEP]
[CLS] suddenly , six years ago she ' d simply stopped coming out to his farm to visit her father , his lead trainer , and he ' d missed her almost painfully . [SEP]
[CLS] there had been times when he ' d been furious that she was n ' t here for him so he could o feast on her glorious beauty or just rev ##el in her laughter and smile . [SEP]
[CLS] then there were other times when he was relieved that he would n ' t have to find another woman to ease the ache she always left in him after he saw her or spoke with her because she was too young . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was older now . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t a teenager with soul ##ful eyes that laughed at his dry humor or teased him about his arrogance . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t be racing ahead of him on her horse , her long , slender legs holding onto her horse and her bottom bouncing on her saddle , giving his mind images that were inappropriate and leaving him hard and aching . [SEP]
[CLS] every year she ' d grown more beautiful and more interesting . [SEP]
[CLS] each visit had left him with an ache , a desire to be with her more often which he ' d had to fight with every fiber in his being . [SEP]
[CLS] when she ' d turned eighteen , it had been the hardest because she ' d continued to grow into that figure that had him dreaming about holding her in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t count the number of times he ' d woken up in a sweat because he wanted her so desperately . [SEP]
[CLS] as he looked down into those blue eyes , he rev ##ele ##d in the fact that she was now old enough for his pursuit . [SEP]
[CLS] and he would have her . [SEP]
[CLS] she might resist at first , but it would be just out of habit . [SEP]
[CLS] he would show her that he wanted more from her and they could explore this attraction he knew they both shared . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , rachel would be in his bed and they could expand the friendship they used to have so that it was more , deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] he stepped closer , his nose filling up with her soft , feminine scent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like . . . ' ' ` ` dinner is ready , ' ' her father called out from the kitchen , interrupting whatever it was that rai ##s was about to say . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel blinked , looking around as if she ' d forgotten where they were . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been about to touch her , his hand reaching out , his fingers so close to her cheek that she ' d almost felt his fingers against her skin even now . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath and stepped around rai ##s , moving on un ##stead ##y feet towards the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well . . . thank you for stopping by . . . ' ' ` ` you ' re father invited me for dinner , ' ' he interrupted , amused that she was trying to get rid of him . [SEP]
[CLS] interesting , he thought to himself . [SEP]
[CLS] she was nervous , he realized . [SEP]
[CLS] nervous about being near him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been around women enough to know that her trembling meant she was just as interested in him . [SEP]
[CLS] that and the way she ' d looked into his eyes , the soft blush that had bloom ##ed on her cheeks when she ' d first seen him . [SEP]
[CLS] his grown up rachel was showing all the signs and he had a hard time hiding the reaction his body was having to her attraction for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to take her into his arms and kiss her , feel her against him and show her that everything would be okay , that she did n ' t need to be nervous around him . [SEP]
[CLS] but her father ' s interruption slowed him down , gave him time to step back and enjoy this delicious tension between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he invited you for dinner ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked over at her father , wondering why he would do something like that . [SEP]
[CLS] if he knew how she felt , why had he cornered her like this ? [SEP]
[CLS] but how could he have avoided issuing the initiation ? [SEP]
[CLS] if rai ##s had shown up unexpectedly , rachel knew there was no way her father could avoid inviting rai ##s in for a meal . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t just that rai ##s was her father ' s employer . [SEP]
[CLS] they were friends who respected each other . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel knew that they often din ##ed together when she was n ' t here , talking about the horses and the farm , not to mention playing chess together often when rai ##s was n ' t entertaining the elite of washington and virginia society at the main house . [SEP]
[CLS] she sat down at the table , taking her napkin and placing it over her lap . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind just could n ' t wrap itself around the fact that her father , the man who knew how she felt about rai ##s , had even con ##sp ##ired with her to avoid him so ass ##id ##uously for the past six years , had violated her trust like this and invited the enemy to dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s and john discussed the various horses in the stables over dinner while rachel pushed the food around on her plate , too nervous to actually eat anything . [SEP]
[CLS] the tiny table barely had enough room for two people so adding a third person , and especially one as large as rai ##s , made the confines beyond cozy . [SEP]
[CLS] she kept shifting her legs , trying to avoid touching his , but he would just move his legs right back so that they were touching again . [SEP]
[CLS] it was frustrating and her stomach clenched each time she felt his leg or his thigh against hers . [SEP]
[CLS] she pretended like it did n ' t matter , but by the end of the meal , she was jump ##y and irritated with herself for letting things get like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you two go on out to the family room and i ' ll clean up , ' ' her father said , picking up the plates and heading towards the sink . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no way , ' ' she said adamant ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dad , you cooked dinner so i ' ll clean up . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s obvious that you and rai ##s have lots to talk about so i ' ll do the dishes , ' ' she countered , starting to take the dishes out of his hands but he just pulled them out of her reach and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] he could n ' t look at her as cleared the table , chuck ##ling softly at her fee ##ble attempt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ve been talking all through dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] you two go out there and catch up and i ' ll just finish the dishes in here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] again ? [SEP]
[CLS] why was her father doing this to her ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d better be heading back to town , ' ' she said instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you have n ' t even seen the beau ##ties , ' ' her father countered , looking over his shoulder at her with a worried expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` besides , i thought you were staying overnight . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t you bring your bag with a change of clothes ? [SEP]
[CLS] if not , you know there are plenty of clothes still here for you . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s , how about if you take her out to the stables see them ? [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re yours anyway . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned back to rachel with a huge grin on his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to love these guys , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve never seen anything quite like them in my life , and that ' s saying a lot . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel knew he was discussing some new horses rai ##s had recently purchased , but the very last thing she wanted to do was go out to the stables in the dark with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s okay . . . ' ' ` ` nonsense , ' ' rai ##s argued , stepping in quickly as he suspected she was too nervous to be alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go change clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t go into the stables like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel felt like her whole body was on fire when his eyes traveled down her figure , looking at the lavender straight skirt and cotton shirt she ' d don ##ned this morning . [SEP]
[CLS] she was even wearing matching lavender shoes which had felt so special earlier in the day , but now she just felt dump ##y knowing that the women he normally associated with could afford much better , more expensive clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] outfits that did n ' t dr ##oop by the end of the day as this one was doing . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel bit her lip in ind ##ec ##ision . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to see what were obviously new horses , but she did n ' t want to be alone with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen him in action too many times over the years , spying on him from the loft in the stables or from the rose garden , from an empty stall or in various places where she could see him with his lady loves . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d always admired the way he would move in closer , stealing a kiss that would eventually lead to more with his expert seduction . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes much more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i . . . ' ' she was stump ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it can wait . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he moved in closer , unwilling to give her a rep ##rie ##ve . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you afraid to be alone with me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked gently , forcing her eyes to look into his and reading that fear , that anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t speak for a long moment , too stunned to hear him ask such a b ##lat ##ant question . [SEP]
[CLS] she sp ##uttered , trying to jump start her brain and give him a firm set down , or just a flip response . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , nothing came to mind and her only defense was to step around him and shake her head in denial . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , i ' m really tired . [SEP]
[CLS] i think i ' ll pass tonight . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he would n ' t take no for an answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you wo n ' t change clothes , you ' ll just have to go out like that , ' ' he said , ignoring her comment about passing on the sights and taking her hand in his , dragging her out into the darkness and closing the door behind them . [SEP]
[CLS] as the night air closed around them , he slowed down and pulled her closer , tucking her arm into his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see ? [SEP]
[CLS] this is n ' t so bad , ' ' he said and smiled down into her nervous eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel tried to pull her hand off of his arm , but he held it in place and kept on walking . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look beautiful in that color , by the way , ' ' he commented . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel tried to ignore the co ##zine ##ss of the atmosphere , the intimacy of the darkness which made everything else fade into the background . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she said , clearing her throat and pretending to look around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you going to show me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` some new horses i think you ' ll like . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel loved horses , loved riding and just being around the strong , gentle creatures . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are they so special ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , becoming interested despite her nervous ##ness and irritation with his commanding attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] he opened the heavy door to the stables and they were immediately enveloped into the warmer , more humid air that kept the horses comfortable during the colder autumn and winter months . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll see , ' ' he said with a mysterious smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he led her down to the third stall and opened the top gate . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and stepped back , letting her peer inside . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel looked at his handsome face filled with excitement and had to smile herself . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked a little bit like a small boy on christmas morning , eager to see what kinds of presents he ' d received under the tree . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a step closer and looked inside the stable and the sight she saw made her gasp with awe . [SEP]
[CLS] staring back at her were two of the most beautiful thoroughbred horses she ' d ever seen in her life . [SEP]
[CLS] one was pure white and the other pure black , both of them just standing in the middle of the large stall , sniffing the air in order to determine if the new scent was friend or foe . [SEP]
[CLS] when she stuck out her hand , wanting to touch the newest beau ##ties , they re ##bu ##ffed her initially , too proud to come close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here , ' ' rai ##s said and handed her some sugar cube ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they both have a horrible sweet tooth . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took the sugar cube ##s , pretending that she did n ' t shiver when their hands touched , then turned back to the beau ##ties . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought a white thoroughbred was rare . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are . [SEP]
[CLS] but this one came on sale just a few months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a bidding war for him but i was determined . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] as the horses approached , sniffing in her hand to see what she had for them , rachel could n ' t stop her eyes from rolling at his comment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you won . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t you always ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i prefer to win . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned against the stall , watching her as she smiled at the horses as they nu ##zzled her palm licking up the last of the sugar crystals . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i would love to win all the time . [SEP]
[CLS] but that does n ' t happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what have you lost recently ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , not believing he ' d ever lost at anything in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] his smile grew slightly and he shrugged one shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing recently . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she raised one eyebrow at him as she said , ` ` have you ever lost something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and moved closer , running his hand down the black mare ' s neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure i ' ve lost . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t keep track of those issues though . [SEP]
[CLS] i move on and figure out how to overcome that challenge . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he hesitated for a moment , then said , ` ` come riding with me tomorrow ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] immediately she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? [SEP]
[CLS] you used to love to ride . [SEP]
[CLS] and i used to love watching you ride . [SEP]
[CLS] i have n ' t seen you on a horse in years . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blushed and shook her head again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ride , ' ' she countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just not when i ' m around . [SEP]
[CLS] why is that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged , feeling as if he were closing in on her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i guess our schedules just have n ' t been in sync lately . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` or you ' ve purposely been avoiding me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lower lip nervously and took a step backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would i do that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , it ' s really just been a crazy period in my life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then come with me . [SEP]
[CLS] show me that you can ride like you used to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t ride like you used to or you ca n ' t ride at all ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can ride ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped , rising to the challenge he was tossing out there at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good . [SEP]
[CLS] then we ' ll ride tomorrow morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blinked and shook her head slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? [SEP]
[CLS] no , i did n ' t mean that i could . . . . ' ' ` ` it ' s settled , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you can even ride this guy here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] what had just happened ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t agree to ride with you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved in even closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure you did . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that you ' re afraid to be alone with me for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] but it will be fine tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll be the perfect gentleman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve seen you in action , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re never the perfect gentleman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put his hands on her hips as he moved even closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` were you spying on me as a kid ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked softly , his eyes looking at her lips . [SEP]
[CLS] she pressed back against the wall , her breathing ragged and heavy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then how do you know i was n ' t a gentleman ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t spying . [SEP]
[CLS] i was around doing my chores or my homework and you just happened to be around with your . . . . ' ' she halted , not exactly sure what to call the parade of brunette ##s that had come through his life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lady friends ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put in for lack of a better word . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] lots of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to keep the jealous ##ly out of her voice , but even she heard the angry tone come out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i really do n ' t want to be one of them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she put her hands on his chest and pushed , but he did n ' t move , not even an inch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what if you ' re not one in a crowd ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at her beautiful features and had to agree with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re definitely not part of the crowd , rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please let me go , ' ' she begged , looking to the right so she did n ' t have to look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was shaking everywhere and his touch was strong and firm , even better than she ' d dreamed about . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel wanted so much to be kissed by this man , to know what all the other women had experienced . [SEP]
[CLS] but she would n ' t be able to endure it when he moved on to the next woman . [SEP]
[CLS] she had enough trouble coming out here to visit her father . [SEP]
[CLS] if she had memories of his kiss to deal with , those visits would be even worse . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] she sounded sincere but everything inside him was telling him to move forward , to test those lips and find out if she really was as soft as she looked . [SEP]
[CLS] his body was already hard and aching , wanting to pull her against him , to make love to this woman so thoroughly that she would n ' t remember any of the men in her past . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go , ' ' she gasped and slipped out of his arms , relieved that he had n ' t been holding her very tightly so it was easier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was nice seeing you , ' ' she lied without looking back in his direction . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to see him again , she did n ' t want to know if he was angry with her for leaving him like that . [SEP]
[CLS] all she wanted to do was get as far away from him as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] when she reached her father ' s cottage , she slammed the door closed and leaned against it , trying to get her breath back after the frantic rush out of the stables . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hard run ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her father asked from his favorite cozy chair . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel jumped and opened her eyes , looking around to find her dad . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you ' d be asleep by now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` at only eight o ' clock ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m old , but i ' m not that old yet , little lady . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and walked over to the sofa , pretending that nothing was bothering her even though he ' d seen her against the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what are you reading tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked conversation ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] her dad laughed softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you really going to try and pretend like you did n ' t just come into the house like the demons from hell were chasing you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused as he took in her flushed cheeks and bright eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at him as if he ' d just spoken a scary truth that she did n ' t have the courage to acknowledge . [SEP]
[CLS] which was exactly the case . [SEP]
[CLS] when had her father become so aware of human frail ##ties ? [SEP]
[CLS] he was a genius at guessing when a horse was upset , but she ' d always thought he was oblivious when it came to human interactions . [SEP]
[CLS] taking a deep breath , she paste ##d a smile on her face and pretended to be relaxed , letting her shoulders drop and her stance widen slightly so she did n ' t look like a terrified rabbit hiding from a wil ##y fox . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the horses were beautiful . [SEP]
[CLS] how long have they been here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] her father smiled and shook his head , not letting her get away with a subject change . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened between you and rai ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes and straightened up to get herself a cup of herbal tea which she knew her father had probably already prepared for her . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , sitting on the counter was a cup of peach tea brewing with steam rising from the aromatic liquid . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he just . . . ' ' she waved her hand in the air , trying to put a description to rai ##s that would n ' t reveal too much about what had just happened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , he was his normal self . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused , one eyebrow raised as he watched his daughter carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he made a pass at you then ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she coughed from the sip of peach tea she ' d just sipped . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally had her breath back , she looked up at him and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would you say that ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m like his kid sister , you ' ve always said . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he rolled his eyes and dropped the magazine he ' d been reading . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` have you taken a look at yourself lately , rachel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was an odd question coming from her father . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked back at him curiously as she sat back down on the sofa , pretending to be relaxed when all she wanted to do was hide in her room and try to figure out what had just occurred in the stable between her and rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a subject she definitely did n ' t want to discuss with her father of all people . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course . [SEP]
[CLS] what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you have to know that rai ##s has n ' t looked at you like a sister since you were about sixteen or seventeen years old . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced at her father , surprised by his comment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would you say something like that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] what had she missed over the years ? [SEP]
[CLS] had rai ##s said something to her father ? [SEP]
[CLS] what was she missing ? [SEP]
[CLS] john smiled at his lovely but oblivious daughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , that man has been interested in you for years . [SEP]
[CLS] the only reason he ' s waited this long to do anything about it was because initially you were too young . [SEP]
[CLS] once you were old enough , i ' m pretty sure he would have done something about his interest , but by that time , you were off at college and making dar ##n sure you were n ' t here when he visited . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with his last comment , she narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you trick me into coming here tonight ? [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that he would be here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was already shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know me better than that . [SEP]
[CLS] i respect your wishes , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] but i do n ' t think you ' re being very fair to him . [SEP]
[CLS] the two of you used to talk so much i was sometimes jealous of the friendship you had . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that startled her because she loved her father , never wanted to hurt him . [SEP]
[CLS] and here he was admitting that the times she ' s spent with rai ##s in the past had given him pain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you say something ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , worried ##ly looking across the room at him . [SEP]
[CLS] his smile soothe ##d her slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because he was good for you . [SEP]
[CLS] you were more outgoing with his encouragement . [SEP]
[CLS] he would say you might be good at something at school and that was all the encouragement you needed . [SEP]
[CLS] you went after whatever he ' d suggested with gust ##o and excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes you failed and sometimes you succeeded . [SEP]
[CLS] but without his words of encouragement , you would n ' t even try anything new . [SEP]
[CLS] you were such a shy little girl for so long , afraid of your own shadow most times and nothing i said would change the way you looked at yourself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s not true , ' ' she said , not sure if she was denying rai ##s ' influence over her choices or how shy she was as a little girl . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled softly at her and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course it ' s true . [SEP]
[CLS] and believe it or not , you probably had the same , surprisingly powerful influence over him . [SEP]
[CLS] i remember the two of you arguing over poverty one afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t even remember what the argument was about specifically but you were pretty firm about what you thought his dad should be doing in dun ##ari . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she remembered that argument clearly . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been a hot afternoon and they ' d just come back from riding down to the creek and back . [SEP]
[CLS] she was standing in the stables rubbing down her horse and he was standing next to her , helping at times but mostly just arguing with everything she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? [SEP]
[CLS] we argued about a lot of things when i was younger , ' ' she said , fi ##dget ##ing in her chair , unable to look him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] her dad smirked before he said , ` ` honey , you argued with rai ##s about poverty and the next week i read about a huge shipment of school books and pre - packaged meals heading into the desert villages of dun ##ari . [SEP]
[CLS] education levels increased in that country ten ##fold over the five years following your argument . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened at his announcement and she felt weak , shaky enough that she needed to put her cup of tea on the small , wooden table beside the sofa . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that does n ' t mean i had the influence to change his mind . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said that disc ##lai ##mer softly , as if she were worried about speaking them too loudly . [SEP]
[CLS] john groaned . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you so powerful ##ly against the man ? [SEP]
[CLS] you did n ' t used to be this closed minded . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t like who he is now , dad . [SEP]
[CLS] ca n ' t we just leave it at that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her father was silent , thinking things over in his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you call it a night ? [SEP]
[CLS] you look pretty tired . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was exhausted and relieved to have a break from this conversation so she smiled and stood up quickly to escape . [SEP]
[CLS] she washed out her tea cup , grabbed her bag from the floor where she ' d dumped it earlier then walked over to her father . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good night , dad , ' ' she said and kissed him on the cheek . [SEP]
[CLS] in her tiny room that barely had enough room for a bed and a dresser , she got ready for sleep , then curled up under the warm blankets , ready to just lose herself in sl ##umber so she did n ' t have to think about what her father had revealed to her tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , no matter how tired she was , she could n ' t find the escape of sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] she kept going over the evening , the almost - kiss with rai ##s , her father ' s comments about how rai ##s might have steered her life , the way she ' d felt when he was close to her and made her whole body shiver with excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about the conversations they ' d had together while she ' d been growing up but too many times , those memories were interrupted by images of rai ##s with a long - haired beauty in his arms , kissing her in the stables or wherever they happened to be . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated him for all of those women . [SEP]
[CLS] and for being so handsome and incredibly male that she had n ' t seriously dated any man herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d dated , of course . [SEP]
[CLS] and she ' d kissed many of her dates . [SEP]
[CLS] but it had n ' t ever gone further than that . [SEP]
[CLS] she just could n ' t become intimate with a man who left her feeling luke ##war ##m at best when she knew that just the thought of rai ##s made her feel things that no man had ever even come close to eng ##end ##ering within her . [SEP]
[CLS] damn him ! [SEP]
[CLS] why could n ' t he just stay out of her life ? [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been doing so well ! [SEP]
[CLS] she even had a man she was interested in that worked in her building . [SEP]
[CLS] as an even planner it was a bit harder to date when most of her friday and saturday nights were taken up with overseeing parties and weddings . [SEP]
[CLS] but she ' d been smiling at a handsome man in her office building , someone who was kind and made an effort to speak to her in the elevator . [SEP]
[CLS] he was nice , normal and did n ' t rule a powerful country . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , he was in her league and she could have a future with him . [SEP]
[CLS] potentially . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 2 she felt the firm lips on hers and sighed with happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , ' ' she whispered , wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling him closer . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt his hands on her waist , she grabbed his wrist and moved his hand higher , pressing his palm against her breast and arching into that caress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , ' ' she heard him groan and she smiled as she kissed him again , deeper , her mouth pressing against his . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt him pull away , she shook her head and cried out for him not to leave her again . [SEP]
[CLS] with a groan , he kissed her back , hard , taking charge of the kiss and sending shivers throughout her whole body . [SEP]
[CLS] the dream was wonderful , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] this had to be the best dream of rai ##s she ' d ever had and it melted her mind , fi ##zzled electricity through her toes and she wanted to sleep forever . [SEP]
[CLS] but his hand was moving on her breast and that made her . . . not really uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] that was n ' t the word . [SEP]
[CLS] it made her hot . [SEP]
[CLS] she kicked the blankets off of her and tried to cool down , but the heat only increased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hot , ' ' she sighed and pressed herself against the heat , rubbing her body against his hard length . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` too hot , ' ' she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s shook his head , trying to clear it from the desire that was sur ##ging through him . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled away , only to have her hands pull her down again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , ' ' he growled , not sure how to handle this . [SEP]
[CLS] she was still half asleep and , even knowing that , he wanted desperately to take advantage of her soft sighs and her sweet , warm body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , you have to wake up , ' ' he said and pulled his hand away from her perfect breast covered in only a thin , blue cam ##iso ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] she wore nothing but this top and her underwear and looked like any man ' s dream woman . [SEP]
[CLS] all her curves were on display and when she pushed those blankets down , he was able to look at her slender waist , her slightly curved stomach and those hips that ended with her long , strong legs with muscles built up through years of riding and tough chores . [SEP]
[CLS] he told himself to look away , but this woman had been the subject of his fantasies for so long , he just could n ' t help but drink his fill . [SEP]
[CLS] she was even love ##lier than he ' d imagined and he wanted to bend down and kiss her , to taste her and feel her wig ##gle underneath him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t want to wake up , ' ' she sighed , and ran a hand down his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s caught her hand moments before she reached his erection that was pressing against his riding pants and he had to stand up and walk out of her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] in the kitchen , he braced his hands against the counter ##top , breathing hard and willing himself to regain control of his body . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing that she was in that bedroom , less than five feet away with barely any clothes on was painfully hard to resist . [SEP]
[CLS] and what made the whole situation worse was that she wanted him . [SEP]
[CLS] possibly just as much as he wanted her ! [SEP]
[CLS] that was pure torture ! [SEP]
[CLS] damn her ! [SEP]
[CLS] why had she stayed away so long ? [SEP]
[CLS] why had she hidden from him ? [SEP]
[CLS] if she felt this way about him , she should have done something about it years ago ! [SEP]
[CLS] he was furious with her for staying away , for denying them this attraction they felt for each other . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been aching for just the sight of her for six long years and all this time , she ' d been feeling the same way ? [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d be damned if he would hold back now ! [SEP]
[CLS] he thought about last night , when she ' d turned and practically ran away from him he ' d thought she might not feel that way about him . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d gotten the signals from her from the moment she ' d walked into her dad ' s house but when she ' d run away , he ' d thought that maybe he ' d misunderstood . [SEP]
[CLS] now he knew better and she was n ' t going to pull away from him any longer ! [SEP]
[CLS] no way ! [SEP]
[CLS] all those other men she ' d had in the past . . . . the men who had taught her to do those things she ' d just done to him . . . . he ' d make them disappear from her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] no man was going to occupy that woman ' s mind but him ! [SEP]
[CLS] he heard movement behind her door and closed his eyes , reigning in that temper and the lust just in time . [SEP]
[CLS] she opened the door , pulling on her thin , cotton robe at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] when she saw him , she ye ##lp ##ed and almost jumped back into her bedroom , but instead , she pulled herself together and finished tying the robe closed , even clenching the neck ##line with one hand while she stood there in her bedroom doorway looking at him warily . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was so startled to see rai ##s in her dad ' s kitchen that she almost dove back into her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] after dreaming such vivid scenes of him making love to her she felt stunned to see him in the flesh like this . [SEP]
[CLS] he was rugged ##ly handsome with a darkness in his eyes that always fascinated her . [SEP]
[CLS] this morning , it seemed to be stronger . [SEP]
[CLS] there was something about him that was . . . . almost magnet ##izing her eyes to his ph ##ys ##ique . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps she was just imagining things after that dream that had felt so . . . . real ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her voice hoarse and dry . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed coffee desperately , but she ' d have to go around him to reach the coffee on the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] after the dream she ' d just had , she did n ' t want to get too close to him , afraid of what she might do . [SEP]
[CLS] she was still shaking from the impact of that dream and her body was almost humming in anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s looked at her , taking in her long legs and her messed up hair . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked like she ' d just made love with passionate abandon and he had to close his eyes or lose that control again . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a deep breath and when he opened them again , he was back in control . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we were going riding this morning . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head and backed away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not going riding today . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to help my dad in the stables . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put his hands on his hips , shaking his head at her rejection while his grin grew wider . [SEP]
[CLS] she was challenging him and he thought she was adorable . [SEP]
[CLS] he would win her over but he was going to enjoy the chase . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you agreed to go riding with me last night . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s why i ' m here . [SEP]
[CLS] so go pull on riding clothes and let ' s get out of here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped and his smile turned lethal . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` unless there ' s something more interesting that you ' d rather do inside . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused to let his words sink in before he said , ` ` i ' m open to suggestions . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , i ' d really rather not go . . . ' ' ` ` too bad . [SEP]
[CLS] you either come riding with me right now , and believe me , i have a great deal of . . . energy . . . to work off , ' ' he said , using the term diplomatic ##ally because he was still in a rage about the idea of another man touching her perfect , beautiful body , ` ` or i ' ll take that as an invitation that you want me to stand here and think of other things to do with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped at his suggestion , her eyes wide with the possibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] but before she could go much further , he took a step towards her and she ye ##lp ##ed before diving back into her room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ten minutes rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you have ten minutes and then i ' m coming in after you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she flew into the bathroom and showered , not bothering to wash her hair because she did n ' t have that kind of time . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t think rai ##s would really come in to fetch her in ten minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d always acted like a gentleman when he was around her in the past but something told her not to challenge him today . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure he was willing to offer that same gentleman ##ly behavior this morning . [SEP]
[CLS] that look in his eyes told her that he appeared to be a man on the edge of a dangerous emotion and she had absolutely no idea how to deal with whatever was bothering him . [SEP]
[CLS] she showered and dried off in record time , her eyes flying to the clock every few seconds to gauge her progress . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled on a pair of old riding pants and was just slipping her arms into the sleeves of an old , fl ##anne ##l shirt when the door to her bedroom flew open . [SEP]
[CLS] she swung around while her fingers fumbled with the buttons , trying to close her shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was n ' t ten minutes rai ##s ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled and walked further into her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i realized that you did n ' t have any coffee this morning so i was trying to be nice and bring you some . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he set the cup on the dresser then backed up , but not completely . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` cream and sugar , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , crossing his arms over his chest as he waited for her to finish button ##ing her fl ##anne ##l shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` fine ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped , not even thanking him since he ' d barge ##d in here like that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll need a sweater , ' ' he commented when she turned around and took a sip of the coffee . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s cooler outside than normal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes lit on her shirt , enjoying the way the buttons gaped in the center where her breasts pushed against the material . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the black lace , by the way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smacked her hand over her breasts , knowing exactly what he was looking at . [SEP]
[CLS] the shirt was one of her older ones and she ' d filled out more than she ' d realized over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go away , ' ' she growled and set her cup back down on the dresser with a thud . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled a large sweatshirt out of the top of her closet and pulled it over her head before turning back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my boots are n ' t in here , ' ' she said and left , leaving him standing in her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s watched her walk out of her room , knowing that she was furious with him . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought it was cute the way her eyes flashed and her chin ju ##tted out . [SEP]
[CLS] no one ever dared to show their anger at him , afraid of losing their job or even their life . [SEP]
[CLS] with a snap of his fingers , he could have someone imprisoned for life but this slender beauty did n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] she gave as good as she got and he thought it was adorable . [SEP]
[CLS] even sexy ! [SEP]
[CLS] when he walked out , he was treated to a view of her cute bottom while she bent over , trying to pull her riding boots on . [SEP]
[CLS] she stumbled and he thought about reaching out to steady her , more than willing to help . [SEP]
[CLS] she must have read his mind because she swung around and glared at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he was caught staring at her but did n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] he even smiled and continued to run his eyes over her slim figure , loving the way her cheeks turned even more colorful with each passing moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t you have things to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] wars to start or villages to pl ##under ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as she stomped her foot one more time to get the boot fully on . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled at her tau ##nt , enjoying her dry wit . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll pl ##under tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] today , i ' m completely free , and ready to entertain fei ##sty brunette ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel glared at him , wondering if he ' d meant to imply the double en ##ten ##dre . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s ride , ' ' she said and pulled the front door to the cottage open . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not spending the day with you though , ' ' she argued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m here to spend the weekend with my dad so you ' re just out of luck . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s smiled and followed her out the door , enjoying the view . [SEP]
[CLS] the horses were already saddle ##d and were walking around one of the co ##rral ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at the first sight of rachel and rai ##s coming down the pathway her horse , do ##lce , hurried over towards her , eager to be reunited with her companion . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel greeted her horse , pet ##ting her and loving her , telling her how beautiful she was , her hands sliding over the flanks of the horse to make sure that the stable hand had saddle ##d her properly . [SEP]
[CLS] her father had given her this beauty when she was fourteen and do ##lce was getting up in the years but she was still a really wonderful horse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would n ' t you like a younger ride ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s asked , already knowing the answer . [SEP]
[CLS] a rider and horse with that kind of commitment would n ' t want to be exchanged for a newer model . [SEP]
[CLS] he could tell they were ins ##ep ##arable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sh ##h ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she snapped at him , running her hands over do ##lce ' s long , shiny neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t say things like that ! [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ll hurt her feelings . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the horse and reassured her with soft words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t listen to the bad man , sweetie . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just mean and horrible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s rolled his eyes , but he was amused by her characterization of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mean and horrible ? [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think anyone has actually said that to my face , or even in my hearing before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , they say it , ' ' she said with a grin as she walked do ##lce out of the co ##rral and pulled herself up onto do ##lce ' s back on one graceful movement before she turned to look down at him from her new height . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just probably put them in prison for it , do n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , she laughed and nudged the horse with her knees and off they were down the pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s watched her ride away , always me ##sm ##eri ##zed by the sight of rachel on her horse . [SEP]
[CLS] they were like one , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] both of them knew exactly what the other was thinking and it was a stunning sight . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s hair flew out behind her back and she barely held onto the reigns , letting them hang loose while she controlled the horse with those incredible legs of hers . [SEP]
[CLS] when she turned the corner in the path and headed out of sight , rai ##s realized that he ' d just been standing there like a loves ##ick idiot while she rode away . [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled but re ##med ##ied the situation quickly by pulling himself up on his stallion , turning him in the direction she ' d just disappeared into . [SEP]
[CLS] he caught up to her easily since his stallion was much younger and stronger than her mare . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even mind riding behind her , enjoying the view of her bottom bouncing on the saddle as she pushed the horse to a tr ##ot . [SEP]
[CLS] they rode through their usual paths , down by the creek , up through the pastures and along the river . [SEP]
[CLS] the path had n ' t been used as often , but it was still there . [SEP]
[CLS] when they reached the creek once again , he pulled up beside her and gently pulled at do ##lce ' s reigns , slowing her down until they were stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you do that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel asked , refusing to get down from the mare ' s back . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s was n ' t having any of that . [SEP]
[CLS] he jumped down from his stallion and came around to her . [SEP]
[CLS] when she refused to come down , he simply reached up and lifted her off the horse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t finished riding , ' ' she said angrily and pushed her way out of his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s walk , ' ' he said , ignoring her comment . [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and let do ##lce ni ##bble on the grass next to the other horse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and took several steps backwards . [SEP]
[CLS] the sun was starting to warm up the air and her sweatshirt was getting a bit too hot , but she could n ' t pull it off because she knew her shirt was too small underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` tell me about your job , ' ' he said and pulled a leaf off of the tree . [SEP]
[CLS] she did the same , examining the veins on the leaf as she absently walked beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you want to know ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shrugged slightly as he looked down onto her shiny hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been years since we talked like this and i remember how you would change your career goals about every month when you were a kid . [SEP]
[CLS] you wanted to be everything ranging from a go ##ur ##met chef , ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on or gardener who would save the world . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , i miss talking to you . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s been too long . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel knew he was right , but she did n ' t want to talk to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to even be near him . [SEP]
[CLS] this morning felt like old times , before she realized what he meant to her and before he hurt her by being with so many other women . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i plan parties . [SEP]
[CLS] i help others figure out what they want and get it for them . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he heard the resistance in her voice but was n ' t going to accept defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to get to know the woman she ' d become and he usually got what he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and do you enjoy that kind of work ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged , afraid to give him any insight into her life . [SEP]
[CLS] he could use it to hurt her in some way so she was as eva ##sive as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped along the path and turned to face him , squinting up at him despite the sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , what do you want from me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned against a tree and looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought of several different ways he could answer her question , but rejected each of them , deciding instead to be blunt ##ly honest with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blinked at his response , not sure she heard him correctly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he almost laughed at her stunned reaction , but held back so she would know that he was completely serious about what he was about to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you , in my bed . [SEP]
[CLS] naked and calling out to me , as excited to be with me as i am to be with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe how direct he was but she should have known better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s impossible , ' ' she said softly and started walking again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked as he fell into step with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help it , but the idea of having sex , not just with rai ##s , but with any man , was terrifying . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a deep dread of the sexual act , afraid of the pain and humiliation of it all . [SEP]
[CLS] and sex with rai ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] that would be even more terrifying , even if she knew that their relationship had a future , which it did n ' t since rai ##s was n ' t the kind of man to have just one woman in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would a relationship between the two of us be impossible ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he clarified . [SEP]
[CLS] they were walking along a path that went in and out of the sunshine as they passed under trees , stepped over rocks and jumped the creek as the path wound its way through the woods along the border of his property . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to laugh at his question as she balanced one foot on a rock before jumping onto another , keeping her feet out of the quickly flowing water . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , first of all , you were just talking about sex which is n ' t a relationship , i ' m sorry to inform you . [SEP]
[CLS] but secondly , you do n ' t do relationships , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not a one woman kind of man and i do n ' t really enjoy being just another in a long line of women in your life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he thought about that for a moment and nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] she had some valid concerns and he could easily explain away those women , but he did n ' t want to fright ##en her . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to show her that she could trust him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so if i were to declare fidelity to you , that would reassure you of my intentions ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up at him , then away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re not going down that road . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she abruptly turned around and headed back to the horses , intending to ride back to the stables and start brushing down do ##lce . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where are you going ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this conversation is finished . [SEP]
[CLS] i have things to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she heard him behind her only moments before he grabbed her arm and spun her around . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so do i , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , his mouth covered hers , ob ##lite ##rating her ad ##mon ##ishment for him to leave her alone . [SEP]
[CLS] she stood still for all of one second , maybe only half that time , before she whimpered and her arms went around his neck , her fingers holding onto his shirt tightly because she was n ' t sure what to do . [SEP]
[CLS] this seemed so familiar to her , like it had just happened a few hours ago but that was impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help but kiss him back , feeling her body ign ##ite as his hands moved around her waist and pulled her against his hard body . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never felt anything like this , her whole mind shut down from reality while he kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] his tongue moved inside her mouth , tang ##ling with hers and driving her more insane , heating her up even higher with a need she did n ' t really understand . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled away for a moment , both of them staring at each other as if to gauge the other ' s reactions , their breathing heavy and labor ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ca n ' t do this , rai ##s , ' ' she finally whispered , but her body pressed against his , her mouth opened to scream out but nothing happened as his head dipped down again towards her , his mouth explored her neck , her ear , finding little places that made her shiver and go crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we seem to be doing it quite well already , ' ' he replied , his hand moving underneath her sweatshirt , then under her shirt to finally find her soft skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t right , ' ' she sighed and shivered when she felt his hand against her skin , the rough call ##uses creating a delightful texture that she had n ' t expected possible . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s very right . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her hand down and pressed her palm against his heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is what you do to me , ' ' he said and pushed her backwards , looking down at her the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want you , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] i think you ' re one of the most beautiful and intriguing women i ' ve ever met in my life . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] if he had n ' t stopped touching her , she might have been lost . [SEP]
[CLS] but his words did n ' t sound right . [SEP]
[CLS] they felt practiced and ins ##in ##cer ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe it was her suspicious nature , or perhaps it was just too close to what she wanted to hear . [SEP]
[CLS] but the words were like a cold bucket of water over her li ##bid ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that what you used to whisper to all those other women ? [SEP]
[CLS] the ones you used to bring out to your house and make love to in the stables or near the rose garden ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her eyes focused and her hand steady even if her heart was still pounding away . [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted his head and looked down at her , trying to translate her words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ve never said those things to another woman , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] she watched him , wondering if he was sincere or again telling her what she wanted to hear . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s a shame . [SEP]
[CLS] you might have made more progress in working your way through the female population if you had used those lines . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re very pretty . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed away from him , standing up straight and stepping back . [SEP]
[CLS] she was relieved that he allowed her the space because she was on the border ##line between just letting him continue , wanting to know what all those other women knew . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to feel what they experienced just once in her lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] with this man . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was close to giving in , to throwing caution to the wind and begging him to make love to her despite the fears that were always lurking in the back of her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , sanity prevailed and she took a deep breath to steady herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go , ' ' she said , hurrying over to do ##lce so she would n ' t change her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped her with a word and she froze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , calm on the outside , but inside he was furious and confused , and in more pain from need than he ' d ever experienced . [SEP]
[CLS] she shuddered and started to turn around , but stopped and continued walking away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this just is n ' t right , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re experienced enough to get me to want you but it is n ' t enough . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell are you talking about , rachel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded , st ##riding around her so that he was in between her and her horse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were right there with me so do n ' t even deny that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a very experienced lover , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] any woman would . . . . feel things when you do that with her . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled and crossed his arms over his chest arrogant ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you really going to stand there and tell me that the only reason you felt what you did was because i ' m more experienced than your previous lovers ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t exactly sure how to answer that so she went with the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i can honestly say that you ' re significantly more experienced than all of my past lovers combined . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was such a stunning comment , he was actually speechless . [SEP]
[CLS] he watched , dumb ##st ##ruck , as she walked over to her horse and lifted herself up . [SEP]
[CLS] with a last glance , she turned do ##lce towards the stables and rode off , leaving him standing by the creek watching her , wanting her painfully . [SEP]
[CLS] but more importantly , wanting to understand what she ' d meant . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d bet large sums of money that , when he returned , she would have found an excuse to head back into the city . [SEP]
[CLS] with a self - satisfied grin , he reached for his own stallion and saddle ##d up himself . [SEP]
[CLS] giving her plenty of time to find her father and make her excuses , he rode the long way around the path , ending up in front of his own house and calling for his butler to take care of the horse . [SEP]
[CLS] he normally preferred to rub down his mounts and ensure that they were well fed after he ' d ridden them , but in this instance , he had plans to make , calls to put through . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman thought she could get away after making a comment like that ? [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t know him very well . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel rode right back to the stables , wanting to head back to her apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] but she could n ' t do that . [SEP]
[CLS] first of all , she had n ' t seen her father in several weeks and she knew he was lonely . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , if she ran back to the city , rai ##s would know that he ' d gotten to her . [SEP]
[CLS] he might think her departure was proof that he had some sort of power over her . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t let him think that way . [SEP]
[CLS] so she stayed , ready to keep her distance , but also wanting to show him that she was n ' t affected by him , that she did n ' t need to run and hide about his statement . [SEP]
[CLS] thinking that the safe ##st place to avoid rai ##s would be hanging around the other stable help , she un ##sa ##ddled do ##lce , rubbed her down and then sent her out to the pasture to have fun . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was finished , she looked around for her father , saw him working with one of the vet ##s and gave him space . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi jim , ' ' she said to one of the other stable hands as she patted the horse he ' d been working with into the pasture to follow do ##lce . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` want some help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , taking one of the pitchfork ##s off of the wall and moving into one of the other stalls , not waiting for an answer . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a dirty job , but the horses needed a clean area in which they could sleep and stay warm at night so mu ##cking out the stalls just had to be done . [SEP]
[CLS] they stayed in the pasture as much as possible so they could get exercise and freedom , but they came into the stables overnight . [SEP]
[CLS] she enjoyed the worked because it was hard and made her muscles sore . [SEP]
[CLS] but more to the point , jim was a good guy with lots of funny qui ##ps about working with horse man ##ure and pitchfork ##s and he made her laugh , forgetting for the time her conversation with rai ##s down by the creek . [SEP]
[CLS] she was on her third stall when she heard an angry voice in the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what the hell are you doing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s demanded , hands on his hips as he watched her with furious eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel spun around to looked up at him , trying to hide the shaking she instantly felt when he was close not to mention that the man ' s anger was more than a little intimidating . [SEP]
[CLS] pretending that she was n ' t affected , she shrugged and turned away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m making toast , ' ' she replied with a ridiculous sense of humor . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t bother to answer him honestly because what she was doing was obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re in my way , ' ' she said as she bent to pick up a dark pile of something unnamed from the corner before turning to load it into the wheel ##bar ##row , only to find him standing in front of it , looking like he might explode with fury at any moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you will not be doing this kind of labor , ' ' he growled out . [SEP]
[CLS] he took the pitchfork from her hands and dropped it onto the dirt floor . [SEP]
[CLS] grabbing her wrist , he pulled her out of the stall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you there ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he called out to jim who was just pushing another wheel ##bar ##row out of a stall several down from where they stood . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` finish up in here and make sure this woman does n ' t do any kind of work like this again ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] jim was in his twenties and had only been working on the farm for about two years . [SEP]
[CLS] so he did n ' t have the kind of tenure that the other stable hands had with rai ##s and was terrified . [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded his head quickly then hurried into the stall and took over the pitchfork . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so angry at rai ##s for scar ##ing the younger employee that she spun around to confront him , yanking her wrist out of his grip . [SEP]
[CLS] or tried to . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t letting her go so she just glared up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that was unnecessary and the work has to be done , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re being silly because i can do the work just as easily as he can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` enough , ' ' he snapped and pulled her along to one of the recently cleaned stalls . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her inside and slammed the door . [SEP]
[CLS] at least he released her hand and she rubbed the skin where he ' d held her wrist while he paced back and forth in the small confines of the stall , running his hand over his face and hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t be doing that kind of work rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t ever let me catch you doing that again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she leaned against the wall , crossing her arms over her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why should n ' t i ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m no better than they are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are . . . . ' ' he stopped , his black eyes looking down at her accusing ##ly before he said , ` ` you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed softly at his reply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i ' m certainly glad we cleared that up . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed heavily and came over to her . [SEP]
[CLS] putting an arm on either side of her head , he bent down low . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , you and i are going to . . . . ' ' he stopped and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you just ca n ' t do that kind of work . [SEP]
[CLS] i wo n ' t allow it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes , trying to pretend that she was n ' t nervous with him this close . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , i need to go . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her lips and she panicked . [SEP]
[CLS] she certainly did n ' t want a repeat of their embrace by the creek . [SEP]
[CLS] so in order to avoid that , to avoid kissing him like she wanted to do , to feel his lips move against hers once again , she quickly ducked and stepped out of his embrace . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only because the move was so unexpected that it actually worked . [SEP]
[CLS] she skipped over to the opposite side of the stall and smiled over at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , this has to stop . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what does ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , stalking her slowly , but not re ##lent ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel looked at the shrinking distance between them , then towards the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this . . . kissing me and doing things to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re an active participant , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] i just initiate the . . . pleasant ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] you help me continue . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do not ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled briefly at her ve ##hem ##ence . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come closer and tell me that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took two more steps and she kept calculating the distance between them . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' m safer over here , ' ' she countered . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced towards the door one more time . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew what she was thinking and stopped her with a simple statement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t make it so do n ' t even try , ' ' he said with that deep , sexy voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she was smiling and did n ' t even realize it . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s in this kind of mood was different , somehow flirt ##ati ##ous and she had to ignore that voice in her head that told her to just rush into his arms and throw herself at him . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she said , ` ` you do n ' t understand the depth of my desperation . [SEP]
[CLS] it makes people do crazy things . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i believe that could be said right back at you my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve felt you in my arms a few too many times today . [SEP]
[CLS] i want to finish what we ' ve started . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ? [SEP]
[CLS] in the stables ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , both horrified and amused . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s stopped and looked around . [SEP]
[CLS] he had indeed forgotten where they were , his mind completely absorbed in trying to get this woman to give in to the things he knew she wanted from him . [SEP]
[CLS] things he was more than willing to do with her if she ' d just stop this silly pre ##tens ##e that she was n ' t interested . [SEP]
[CLS] while he was distracted , she took the chance and darted around him . [SEP]
[CLS] she actually ye ##lp ##ed in laughter when he reached out . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , he missed her by mere centimeters and she was able to dart out of the stall . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t stop there but continued out of the stables , wanting to find a place where there were more people to keep her safe from his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] and everything else about him . [SEP]
[CLS] just looking at the man , which she did as she turned the corner and caught him watching her as she hurried away , made her heart skip a beat . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked out into the bright , autumn sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] she took her sunglasses off of the top of her head and slipped them over her eyes as she walked to the co ##rral . [SEP]
[CLS] her father was working one of the new horses and she walked around to the opposite side so she could watch her dad and figure out where rai ##s would go next . [SEP]
[CLS] she was determined to avoid him as much as possible after their first two encounters today . [SEP]
[CLS] well , three if she were to count seeing him in her father ' s cottage when she first woke up . [SEP]
[CLS] on the opposite side of the co ##rral , she watched as rai ##s stepped out into the sunshine as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so startling ##ly handsome with those dark , dangerous eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] and he had muscles no world leader should have . [SEP]
[CLS] she wondered how he worked out and would love to talk to him about his days , find out more what it was like to rule dun ##ari and all the problems he faced , but she did n ' t think he would take her questions seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] at least not right now . [SEP]
[CLS] he sa ##unt ##ered over to lean against the co ##rral fence as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a spot directly opposite where she was standing so she could n ' t really miss him as she watched the horse run through some exercises . [SEP]
[CLS] the horse seemed to be showing off a bit but rachel did n ' t see much of the show . [SEP]
[CLS] what she saw was rai ##s , without any sunglasses , staring back at her . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew the exact moment that his eyes dropped from her eyes to her mouth because his hand came up , one finger rubbing along his own mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] the co ##rral was wide , but not so wide that she did n ' t realize that his eyes dropped once again , focusing on her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] it was at that moment that she remembered that her shirt was too small and the gap showed off a little too much . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and reached down , tugging her shirt tails so that the gap was n ' t so apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] she glared at him when she caught him laughing at her movement . [SEP]
[CLS] and she thought she might actually hate him when his eyebrow went up . [SEP]
[CLS] curse him ! [SEP]
[CLS] there was no way he could tell that her nipples had hardened while he watched her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was too far away , there was no way he could know . [SEP]
[CLS] but they had . [SEP]
[CLS] and she actually thought her breasts had swelled slightly , as if he were caressing them , his mouth lowering to taste the peaks and . . . she shifted slightly and his grin widened once again . [SEP]
[CLS] was he actually making love to her in his mind out here by the co ##rral ? [SEP]
[CLS] and how was it that she knew exactly what he was thinking ? [SEP]
[CLS] no , she gasped when his eyes went even lower . [SEP]
[CLS] she shuffled her legs in the dust , her breathing ragged as her body responded to the heat in his eyes as he looked lower , his gaze focusing on the jun ##cture of her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] she lowered her gaze , her eyes almost unwilling ##ly lowering to find that his erection was more apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t obscene at the moment , but she could easily distinguish the large ind ##entation where it had previously been flat . [SEP]
[CLS] her face pale ##d and her eyes pulled away . [SEP]
[CLS] the excitement of a moment ago was gone , replaced by the panic she felt every time she thought about the intimate act . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled away from the co ##rral fence and shook her head slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the left , terrified of the evidence in front of her but too flu ##stered to figure out where she was or where to go . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced back slightly , but only to see his face while she walked over to say something to her father . [SEP]
[CLS] she must have said something that convinced her dad that she was okay , because he patted her shoulder and turned back to give additional instructions to the training assistant who was in the co ##rral with the horse . [SEP]
[CLS] she hurried down the path and turned the corner around the stable . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was finally out of sight , she leaned against the stable wall and took deep breaths , forcing herself to calm down . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated the way she reacted to the idea of sex every time . [SEP]
[CLS] she was just fine with her dates up until the point that they wanted to discuss becoming intimate , but then she just shut down . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never had a full blown panic attack though . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing like this had ever happened and she had to concentrate to keep herself from hyper ##vent ##ila ##ting . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps it was because she ' d never seen evidence like that before . [SEP]
[CLS] surely it was just because she was so far away that he looked so large . [SEP]
[CLS] that did n ' t make sense , but it certainly helped her to regain her composure . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked several more feet away , then slipped back into the stables . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked by the horses who were being cleaned and even patted one on the nose , further decreasing the panic and allowing her mind to start to function a little bit more rational ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt a bit silly now that she was away from rai ##s and away from the power he had over her . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped at the ladder to the loft , then smiled as she remembered climbing up into the loft and looking down at the stable workers . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen so much from up here . [SEP]
[CLS] from this vantage point , she could see into all the stalls , both stable doors as well as the side doors and even her father ' s office down the way although she could n ' t see inside of it . [SEP]
[CLS] this had been her hideout , the place she ' d come when she was hurt or angry , sad or happy . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d brought friends up here and they ' d played cards when her father would n ' t let her ride any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] if she had n ' t been in the rose garden doing her homework , she ' d be up here . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a magical , secret place where she could read for hours and get a bird ' s eye understanding of what went on throughout the day on the farm . [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed several of the spare bal ##es of hay around , forming a sort of couch where she could curl up and watch , think about what had just happened . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so deep in thought , she did n ' t hear the other person climb the ladder . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t hear rai ##s as he stopped at the top of the loft and watched her for a long moment , contemplating her long hair with small pieces of straw sticking out on various sides . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked over to the edge and looked down into the stables . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so this is where you saw everything that happened over the years , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel started and twisted around , surprised to find him standing right behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was so tall he had to duck down slightly or he ' d hit his head on the roof of the stables , but otherwise , he looked ' right ' up here in the straw and hay bal ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing up here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , curling up into a ball , almost defensive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrapped her arms around her legs and stared up at him , then glanced behind him to the ladder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t go trying to run out on my again , ' ' he said and sat down next to her on her makeshift ' couch ' . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll break your neck trying and then i ' ll be really irritated with you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she had to laugh at his comment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll be irritated with me for breaking my neck ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow at her reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not a good enough threat ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she chuckled again and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not really . [SEP]
[CLS] irritation with you is n ' t anything to be afraid of . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nodded as if accepting her point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how ' s this for a threat . . . if you fall down and break your neck , i ' ll have you exactly where i want you . . . on your back and at my mercy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled at the image but agreed that that threat was better . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i ' ll stay put as long as you stay on that side of the hay . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he instantly agreed with her terms then relaxed back against the hay . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so how did you find this place ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged and looked down over the workers who were milling about , taking care of the horses or hauling in food and water . [SEP]
[CLS] for the next hour , they discussed non - threatening issues like her job , his job , politics and horses . [SEP]
[CLS] she relaxed and sank deeper into the hay , feeling as if their old friendship were back and that pe ##sky sexual tension that always seemed to be around them now had dissipated slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] it was still there and she caught him glancing down at her breasts more often than she wanted to admit , but his eyes always moved back up to her eyes and he paid attention to what she was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] he also laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] his deep , lust ##rous voice laughed at several of the things she commented on and it made her feel special to make him laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you sound so relaxed right now , ' ' she mentioned with a smile of content ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` am i not normally relaxed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , leaning towards her with his arm behind her on the bal ##e of hay . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re always very serious , generally wrapped up in something very complicated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she reached out and touched his forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you have a worry line right here , ' ' she said , her finger touching the line between his dark , tough looking eyebrows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s very intimidating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you are n ' t intimidated by me , are you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and took her hand in his . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t even realize that he was making patterns on her palm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , you ' re very terrifying . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he scoffed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t act like you ' re terrified of me , unless i ' m trying to make love to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes and shifted on the hay bal ##e uncomfortably . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` which is all the time as of today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you blame me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he joked . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled and pulled her eyes away from his , not wanting to get pulled into that sen ##su ##ous heat . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been there once already today , twice if she counted her dream and it was hard to pull out of that kind of intensity . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i do n ' t blame myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you ' d wear something other than a shirt that is too small for you , and one that draws my eyes to that black lace bra you ' re wearing , by the way , then i would n ' t always be trying to make love to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her free hand reached up and covered the gap in her shirt and she tried to pull her hand away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re a really horrible man , ' ' she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] he tugged her hand which caused her to land exactly where he wanted her , in his lap with her hands holding onto his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m just a man . [SEP]
[CLS] you ca n ' t blame me for falling victim to your all ##ure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought that she might be in trouble in this position , but it just felt too good for her to move . [SEP]
[CLS] the alarm bells were ringing , but because of the laughter they ' d been sharing for the past hour or so , she was too relaxed in his company to take him seriously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i ' ve been wrong to be afraid of you , ' ' she said with a sparkle in her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re just a pussy cat , are n ' t you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' he agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m completely un ##com ##pl ##icated and non - threatening . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she threw back her head and laughed at his b ##lat ##ant lie . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re actually a wolf in sheep ' s clothing , trying to lure me into a false sense of security , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand slid up her waist and he raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re correct . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was in trouble , but it just felt too good to be in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first time she had n ' t felt threatened by his near ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] his touch was hot , but not uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to kiss you , rachel , ' ' he said , his voice hu ##skie ##r , deeper somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes dropped to his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to form the words that would ask him not to do that , but they would n ' t come out . [SEP]
[CLS] she should n ' t want this , should be pushing him away , getting off of his lap and running as far away as she could from this man . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , her lips opened slightly , her tongue darted out to wet her lips in anticipation , and her eyes looked into his , her body already turning towards him . [SEP]
[CLS] when his lips touched hers , she gasped at the heat , the electric shock . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never felt anything like this and she shivered , her fingers curling up and diving into his hair while he kissed her . [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed slightly and kissed him back , unable to resist him when he was acting like this . [SEP]
[CLS] she melted in his arms , feeling her shy ##ness slip away . [SEP]
[CLS] that irritation she normally felt when in a man ' s arms was n ' t there either so it was a nice feeling to actually want a man to embrace her . [SEP]
[CLS] why was it that the only person who stirred her interest like this was the one man who was so completely wrong for her ? [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned over , pulling her with him so that she was on her back , leaning down in the soft pile of hay that covered the floor of the loft . [SEP]
[CLS] he could look down at her with desire shining brightly in his eyes and her fingers shook slightly , but she did n ' t want him to stop . [SEP]
[CLS] not yet anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand slowly , gently moved her hand off of her shirt , pushing it gently to the side then his own hand moved back to the front of her shirt . [SEP]
[CLS] his def ##t hands slowly un ##bu ##tton ##ed the front , his eyes watching with heat as her skin was slowly revealed to his gaze . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was breathing heavily now , her body on fire for his touch but there was also a small warning in the back of her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] she ignored it , trans ##fixed by the way his fingers would undo a button , then ski ##m along the skin underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] the autumn air was too warm for a sweatshirt , but as the buttons were released , she realized how cool it actually was . [SEP]
[CLS] and then his fingers would touch her skin and she would be hot again . [SEP]
[CLS] with each button , the process re ##oc ##cu ##rred , the cool air , the heat , cool air , instant heat . [SEP]
[CLS] when he reached the button that held the fabric over her breasts , she held her breath , almost afraid of the process but he did n ' t stop . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes watched in fascination as the button was released and he pushed the material away . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure what to expect when he finally saw her breasts , but the sharp intake of his breath made her feel sexy and powerful . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the raw surge of energy that spiked through her when his hand covered her breast was frightening . [SEP]
[CLS] gone was that heavenly desire that made her arms almost limp with the need to have him hold her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was replaced by that fear that she always felt when a man touched her too intimately . [SEP]
[CLS] she jumped with the feeling , grabbed his wrist and held him away from her as she looked up at him fearful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] that warning bell in her head was louder now and her eyes looked up into his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his whole body stilled when she pulled back . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel did n ' t want this feeling to go away . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe if she just pushed through the fear , that wonderful feeling would come back . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe she could just pretend it was n ' t there and she could continue on . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head and pulled his hand back down against her breast . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` nothing , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` kiss me please , ' ' she begged , then reached up to his head and pulled him down , her mouth kissing him and feeling relief when he took charge , increasing the pressure and that bell faded slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] but when he shifted his weight , pressing her back and moving his legs between hers , the bell sounded loud and clear . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head , pulled away and rai ##s immediately stopped , lifting his head . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , that was n ' t enough . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go , ' ' she gasped , scrambling out from underneath him . [SEP]
[CLS] she tripped on the bal ##e of hay behind her , right ##ed herself and grabbed the beam overhead to steady herself as she almost ran for the ladder down out of the loft . [SEP]
[CLS] she was holding her shirt together as she descended , barely able to steady herself on her decent , but knowing that she had to get away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he called out when his mind cleared enough to realize that she was n ' t just shifting but running away . [SEP]
[CLS] again ! [SEP]
[CLS] this time though , it did n ' t look like she was trying to avoid him so much as just terrified . [SEP]
[CLS] he immediately started to think that perhaps someone had done something to her , something to scare her into hating or being afraid of sex . [SEP]
[CLS] he watched with rising fury as she ran out of the stables , her fingers barely holding her shirt together as she sprinted as far away from him as she could get . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 3 rachel sighed with relief as she pulled into the parking lot of her downtown office building . [SEP]
[CLS] she smoothed the tan skirt down over her hips , then pulled the suit ' s jacket off the backseat of her vehicle , wanting to look nice for work today . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a big wedding she was assisting with this coming weekend which would really help her in the firm . [SEP]
[CLS] the company she worked for , elegant events , was one of the pre ##emi ##nent events firms in the city , catering to some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in washington , d . c . [SEP]
[CLS] the wedding this weekend was for a senator ' s daughter who was getting married at the may ##flower hotel , one of the ri ##tz ##iest and well known establishments in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] everyone in town was working hard to get an invitation to this event . [SEP]
[CLS] all the who ' s who will be there this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] although she was n ' t in charge of the wedding , being too inexperienced at this point in her career , she was one of four assistants who were helping the main coordinator , a tyrant named marissa banks who was one of the best in the industry . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel had been working long hours to ensure that her tasks for the wedding were all taken care of well in advance of the deadline marissa had set out . [SEP]
[CLS] so as she walked into the building , she was reviewing her notes , looking at all the items that would be reviewed in the monday morning meeting so that she could be able to tell marissa that all of her to - do items were completed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , you ' re wanted in derrick ' s office , ' ' the receptionist called out as soon as rachel passed through the frost ##ed glass doors . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel looked over at len ##ora , the sweet and friendly receptionist who guarded the lobby area with sugar coated words , helping the clients with coffee and tea , ensuring that everyone felt like they were the company ' s number one client from the moment they walked in the door . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was halfway through the lobby area when she did a double take at len ##ora ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] derrick was the head of the firm and ran the agency with flair and good humor . [SEP]
[CLS] she really liked him , knew that he ' d grown this agency from almost nothing so she had a great deal of respect for him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m supposed to be in marissa ' s meeting in ten minutes , ' ' rachel called back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you sure derrick wanted me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost un ##heard of for the head of the agency to speak with one of the low ##ly junior members of the staff . [SEP]
[CLS] len ##ora nodded her head em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` derrick asked for you personally , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] he seemed very excited about something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel closed her file folder and looked around as if she could find the reason for this unexpected summons in the walls or carpet ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the lobby area was done in shades of white and cream colors with fresh flowers brought in every week in various shades depending on the season . [SEP]
[CLS] because fall was in full swing , there were yellow ##s and gold ##s this week , creating a stark contrast to the white and cream decor . [SEP]
[CLS] but even the flowers could n ' t provide an explanation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did he say what this was about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] len ##ora shrugged her shoulders and answered the next call , efficiently directing the call to the appropriate person . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel went to her tiny office and put her notes down . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled the papers out of the folder she ' d worked on yesterday after returning home from her father ' s cottage . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , she acknowledged to herself that it was more of a running away scenario . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d spent the rest of saturday evening locked away in her tiny apartment va ##ci ##lla ##ting between fits of anger over rai ##s for pushing her to the breaking point and crying at how pathetic he probably viewed her after the pit ##iable way she ' d scrambled away from him in the loft . [SEP]
[CLS] even now , thinking about the dumb ##founded expression on his handsome face when she ' d glanced back up to him from the stable doorway , she could n ' t believe how childish she ' d acted . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at her small desk covered with vendor information and bro ##chu ##res , her computer screen with sticky notes on three sides and even her lamp had reminder notes . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not the time to work through her fear of intimacy with the fabulous ##ly handsome but terrifying ##ly large she ##ik of dun ##ari , she reminded herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she had tons of work to do and missing anything over the next five days would be extremely bad for her career . [SEP]
[CLS] the phone by her elbow rang , startling her out of her private lecture and she looked down at the number . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an internal call and she nervously picked up the receiver . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , could you come to my office quickly please ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick said with his precise , culture ##d accent . [SEP]
[CLS] derrick was wonderful and fl ##am ##boy ##ant and everything that a gay man ep ##ito ##mi ##zed . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was completely faithful to his partner , a lawyer in a d . c . firm that was powerful because of his own connections and abilities . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that the summons had been phrase ##d as a question , but it was much more along the lines of a command performance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be right there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she walked out of her office quickly , stopping by marissa ' s office which was larger and much more elegant and , thankfully , along the way to derrick ' s office as well . [SEP]
[CLS] because of marissa ' s experience and her client list , the woman had enough space for a much larger desk , several filing cabinets and a round table with luxurious chairs surrounding it so that she could discuss plans with her clients in comfort . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` marissa , i ' m so sorry to do this but derrick has called me down to his office . [SEP]
[CLS] i wanted to stop by and hand you my task list and let you know the status of each , ' ' she said and handed her notes to the older woman . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should be finished with him soon although i do n ' t know what derrick wants me for but here are my tasks that you assigned to me last week and where each issue stands , just in case i wo n ' t be out before you start your status meeting . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] marissa glanced down at rachel ' s neatly typed notes and nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this looks good . [SEP]
[CLS] thank you for being so con ##sc ##ient ##ious . [SEP]
[CLS] let me know when you ' re out of your meeting with derrick so i can give you the next steps for the wedding this weekend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel nodded her head and left the office , nervous about whatever derrick might need to speak with her about . [SEP]
[CLS] as she walked down the hallway , she went through her tasks for the past few weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] had she missed something ? [SEP]
[CLS] or had someone complained about her performance ? [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t think of any other reason why she would be called down to the owner ' s luxurious office . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` go on in , ' ' debra said as soon as rachel stuck her head into the private area where derrick ' s office was located . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole floor was done in shades of white and cream and this area was no exception . [SEP]
[CLS] the cushion ##ed chairs were in white and gold , the tables were topped with glass and cream colored legs . [SEP]
[CLS] all the desk ##s at this end of the hallway were glass with gold and cream stands . [SEP]
[CLS] all colors coordinated beautifully , enhancing the feeling of the agency being a strong wedding group , but the shots of color indicating that they could do much more for their clients than just weddings . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel knocked on the door and stepped in when derrick looked up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what on earth did you do this weekend , dear ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked immediately and waved for her to come inside and sit down . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel did n ' t want to talk about her weekend on the farm with her dad . . . or anything having to do with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] just the memory of being in rai ##s ' arms saturday afternoon made her ache all over again , followed by the painful embarrassment of running away because they went too far for her pathetic ##ally tim ##id little mind to handle . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i went to visit my dad , ' ' she explained honestly , om ##itt ##ing the part where she had to explain that her father worked on the horse farm of one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , i do n ' t know what you ' ve done recently , but you ' re now the official washington , d . c . planner for the she ##ik of dun ##ari . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he clapped his hands together for emphasis and waited for her reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] when she simply sat there for a long moment , derrick took her silence to mean she was just as overwhelmed as he was hoping she would be upon the news . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what ' s even better ? [SEP]
[CLS] he has a series of parties that need to be worked over the next few months . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to be a very busy lady ! [SEP]
[CLS] and the envy of everyone in the office , i ' m thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a major coup for you ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s mouth fell open and she wanted to protest , but the words simply would n ' t come out . [SEP]
[CLS] parties ? [SEP]
[CLS] for rai ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s crazy ! [SEP]
[CLS] that would mean being around him , talking with him , being trapped in his presence more often than she could endure ! [SEP]
[CLS] derrick did n ' t notice her fear and continued talking about the events to be worked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so here ' s the current list of parties , some of them are small , intimate gatherings which should be relatively easy for you to handle . [SEP]
[CLS] the others are a bit more elaborate so you ' ll need to work directly with me on those so i can help you out when you get stuck . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll help you with vendors to make sure that all of them are top notch . [SEP]
[CLS] i know that marissa thinks she has the best in town , but i have many more contacts that can work magic when i need them to . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was still stunned from the news , terrified of the responsibility that rai ##s was handing to her as well as what he might be expecting of her personally . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up , noticing that derrick was looking at her expect ##antly , obviously waiting for her to become a bit more e ##ff ##us ##ive in her excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] her hand fluttered around her head , wondering what words she could say that could get her out of this pre ##dic ##ament . [SEP]
[CLS] derrick would n ' t understand her need to maintain a very big distance between herself and the fabulous ##ly wealthy she ##ik of dun ##ari . [SEP]
[CLS] distance simply was n ' t ' done ' in this line of business . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m obviously grateful for this opportunity , ' ' she finally stammered out when she remembered to close her mouth and think . [SEP]
[CLS] she shook her head , her hand forming a fist as she slowly said , ` ` i do n ' t think i ' m experienced enough to handle these kinds of parties . [SEP]
[CLS] surely someone with more events under their belt should be put in charge of such an important client . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick was already shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the man asked for you personally . [SEP]
[CLS] he said he ' d seen your work and liked the way you handle yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] which was why i asked what you ' d done this weekend , in case you ' d attended some fancy shin dig that i should know about , ' ' he laughed , as if something like that could actually happen . [SEP]
[CLS] derrick knew everything that was happening in the city and anything he did n ' t know about , was n ' t worth attending anyway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but . . . ' ' ` ` no but ##s , darling . [SEP]
[CLS] this is huge for you . [SEP]
[CLS] and do n ' t worry , i explained that you ' d never handled anything this large on your own before and he said he would help you through each step . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , you ' re expected this afternoon for a wine tasting with the man himself for the first party . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s arranging all of the travel because , and this is in his words , he does n ' t want you wasting time on traffic issues when you could be spending your time servicing his needs . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick chuckled at what he thought was an un ##int ##ended pun , but rachel knew that rai ##s had probably meant that exactly as it had come out . [SEP]
[CLS] had rai ##s worked all weekend to come up with this list of parties ? [SEP]
[CLS] or did he genuinely need to entertain like this ? [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that , in the past , he had entertained a great deal . [SEP]
[CLS] she used to watch the catering vans and fl ##oris ##ts come and go from the main house on many occasions , had even helped out in some of the events , working with lucy to polish the silver before rai ##s arrived . [SEP]
[CLS] this list did n ' t seem out of proportion , but it did seem convenient . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d have something to say about this as soon as she called him . [SEP]
[CLS] and her first comment would be that he would have to find someone else to organize his damn parties because she was n ' t going to do it ! [SEP]
[CLS] derrick eagerly discussed the first party , giving her suggestions on where to get the cater ##er , the wines and even the fl ##oris ##t , all very irritating comments since rachel had been working up her own list of vendors that she trusted . [SEP]
[CLS] derrick simply waved her assurance ##s aside and told her to use his vendors for these events because he could be assured of both their discretion and superior quality . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was finally back at her office , she picked up her cell phone and called lucy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi there , it ' s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m trying to reach rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] any way you might be able to get him on the line ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lucy was the housekeeper and more like an aunt to rachel since she ' d grown up without a mother and lucy did n ' t have any children . [SEP]
[CLS] for as long as rachel could remember , lucy had been the woman she ' d gone to when she needed a woman ' s advice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i just saw his highness pass by , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll go get him , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] lucy did n ' t have the same kind of relationship with rai ##s as rachel and her father had , so there was much more formal ##ity between her and her employer . [SEP]
[CLS] but lucy still enjoyed working for rai ##s and made all of his favorite dishes whenever he came to town , spoil ##ing the man in a ridiculous fashion , in rachel ' s personal opinion . [SEP]
[CLS] when she ' d been a kid , lucy ' s efforts had been amusing . [SEP]
[CLS] now , with rachel ' s adult perspective , she considered it just another way that rai ##s charm ##ed women to get what he wanted . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , lucy transferred rachel ' s call to rai ##s who apparently was in his office . [SEP]
[CLS] she could just see him , kicked back in that huge leather chair , his boot ##ed feet up on the massive oak desk in his office that was almost always covered with documents and contracts covering the wide range of businesses rai ##s had in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , what can i do for you , ' ' he said cheerfully , that deep voice sending shivers through her body even from a distance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the helicopter is on its way to pick you up for our meeting this afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope you have some good wines for me to choose from . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her hand gripped the phone almost painfully as her anger with him well ##ed up at his cheerful tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe you ' re messing with my job like this . [SEP]
[CLS] i really do n ' t like this one little bit , rai ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was furious with him for putting her job in jeopardy . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly , enjoying her spitfire attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would have thought working for me was quite a coup in your line of work , my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] so what wines are you bringing me to taste ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was grit ##ting her teeth , furious that he was purposely missing the point . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do this , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m begging you to leave me out of whatever you have planned . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to include you , my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s the only way i can see you . [SEP]
[CLS] if things were left up to you , i ' m guessing that it will be another six years before we accidentally ran into each other again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re right ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she hissed , una ##fra ##id of anger ##ing him . [SEP]
[CLS] others might cater to his w ##him ##s and moods but she was n ' t going to take it from this arrogant man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i ' m not leaving things up to you , ' ' he countered , his voice deep and husky , but firm with his intention . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll see you at one o ' clock , my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll have lunch with the wines . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , he disconnected the call and rachel was left staring at her phone with rising anger . [SEP]
[CLS] he was manipulating her and she did n ' t like it at all ! [SEP]
[CLS] a shadow appeared in her doorway and rachel wiped the fury from her expression just in time to see a liv ##id marissa to stand there , framed by her door and shaking with fury . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just so you know , ' ' marissa said with an angry voice as she stood inside rachel ' s office , ` ` this is n ' t over ! [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re not leaving my team five days before the big event . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel stared wide eyed at the empty door where marissa had just stood , wondering what the older woman had been told about the change . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , derrick was on the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , could you come to marissa ' s office please ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] things were flying through the gossip mills in spectacular fashion today , rachel thought as she put her phone back in the cradle once again . [SEP]
[CLS] normally , mondays were a more relaxing day around here as the coordinator ##s recovered from whatever party they ' d organized over the weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] but apparently marissa ' s wedding was putting everyone on edge with the stress of such an important event looming . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel understood marissa ' s doorway comment now . [SEP]
[CLS] and in a way , it was flat ##tering that marissa was so angry that rachel was being pulled off of the big event . [SEP]
[CLS] it meant that marissa valued rachel ' s contributions and wanted her to remain on the team . [SEP]
[CLS] or it could mean that someone had gotten wind of the newest events and marissa was jealous . [SEP]
[CLS] that would n ' t be good , she thought as she made her way back down the hall with shaking knees . [SEP]
[CLS] as rachel walked down the hallway to marissa ' s office , she could hear the yelling even from several offices away . [SEP]
[CLS] others in the offices looked up , curious to know what was happening and what the blow ##out fight was all about . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he asked for her personally , marissa , ' ' derrick was saying , leaning against the woman ' s desk . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel walked into the office , standing awkwardly in the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m terribly sorry about this marissa , ' ' she said softly , hoping to alleviate some of the woman ' s anger . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i honestly did n ' t expect anything like this . [SEP]
[CLS] i can probably do both the wedding and this party . [SEP]
[CLS] i can work overtime to get everything done so you are n ' t left hanging . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was taken aback by the woman ' s glare , her fury shining through her eyes like nothing rachel had ever seen before . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should be doing these parties . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] marissa spun around to face derrick again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let her take the senator ' s wedding ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll do the she ##ik ' s parties . [SEP]
[CLS] i know international protocols much better than rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' ll mess things up royal ##ly and we could have an international incident on our hands . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel could n ' t believe what she was hearing . [SEP]
[CLS] all this time , rachel had been trying to figure out how to help marissa while the other woman was just trying to get the better event ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel snapped , stepping forward . [SEP]
[CLS] her whole body language changed with the bitter woman ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will not cause an international incident . [SEP]
[CLS] nor will i even cause an office incident such as the one happening right now . [SEP]
[CLS] and as for experience , i think i can do just as good a job , possibly even better , at anticipating she ##ik rai ##s ' concerns than someone who thinks it is appropriate to back stab one ' s cow ##or ##kers . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick looked over at rachel with newfound respect . [SEP]
[CLS] he obviously had n ' t expected his junior organizer to stand up for herself quite so el ##o ##quent ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well said , my dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he turned back to marissa . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` as for you , if you do n ' t stop making a scene , i ' ll take you up on your request to be pulled from the senator ' s wedding this weekend but you definitely wo n ' t be given anything as important as the she ##ik ' s social calendar when you do n ' t have the professional ##ism to finish your current assignment . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and started to walk out of the office but he must have eyes on the back of his head because marissa was just about to say something else but he stopped her cold by spinning around and snapping at her , ` ` forget it ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] before leaving the two women to stand there glaring at each other . [SEP]
[CLS] marissa looked rachel up and down , shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , we know you did n ' t sleep with the guy to get this assignment . [SEP]
[CLS] so i wonder what you did do for him . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel gasped , unable to believe what she ' d just heard . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` excuse me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] marissa knew she ' d scored a point with that statement and took on a smug expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you heard me . [SEP]
[CLS] the ice princess sleeping her way to the top ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m pretty sure that the she ##ik is going to be disappointed when he realizes that you do n ' t . . . ' ' rachel did n ' t even wait for the end of the sentence before she spun around on her heel and walked out of the woman ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe the vi ##tri ##ol the woman was sp ##ew ##ing but her other concern was that mar ##ris ##a actually knew , was n ' t just guessing , but was positive that rachel would n ' t put out . [SEP]
[CLS] it was true about her clients , but the way marissa had said that made her think that she also knew that she did n ' t sleep with any of her boyfriend ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel went back to her office and closed the door before she let her emotions show . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so horrified , insulted by the possibility that her friends and co - workers were gossip ##ing about her sex life . [SEP]
[CLS] or lack of it , she clarified . [SEP]
[CLS] how could they all know ? [SEP]
[CLS] or were they guessing ? [SEP]
[CLS] was it written on her face somehow ? [SEP]
[CLS] what a mess , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t even counter their impressions because , unfortunately , it was true . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to get out of here . [SEP]
[CLS] her office was tiny and she felt as if the walls were closing in on her . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated this feeling so she grabbed her notebook and her purse before rushing out of her office . [SEP]
[CLS] she ran into several co - workers in the hallway but they all looked away , avoiding her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] that hurt , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] it meant that they all knew and all were gossip ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] either about her fight with marissa or the woman ' s horrible accusations . [SEP]
[CLS] how could her sex life even become a topic of conversation ? [SEP]
[CLS] what would cause them to spec ##ulate on things like that ? [SEP]
[CLS] she dated and she had friends who she would talk about her weekends with them . [SEP]
[CLS] they all discussed their dates over lunch in the kitchen or when they went out for lunch ##es or dinners , sometimes even happy hours . [SEP]
[CLS] and yes , several of the other women would give details that rachel thought might be a bit too intimate , but just because she did n ' t share similar details about her dates , that should n ' t imply that she did n ' t have intimate details to share . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , so it might mean that , but her co - workers could n ' t know that . [SEP]
[CLS] for all they knew , she was just being respectful , a woman who did n ' t kiss and tell . [SEP]
[CLS] she slumped down in her car , grateful for the dim lights of the parking garage which allowed her to pull herself together . [SEP]
[CLS] so what if she did n ' t sleep around ? [SEP]
[CLS] that was none of their business . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t sleep with clients , she did n ' t sleep with guys that she could n ' t feel something for . . . that was a decision for her to decide and was n ' t any one else ' s information . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath , putting things into perspective and came to realize that it was n ' t that they knew she did n ' t sleep around . [SEP]
[CLS] it was more the fact that it was common knowledge . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated being the topic of someone else ' s conversations . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just demo ##ral ##izing . [SEP]
[CLS] she started her car and pulled out , driving to the address derrick had given her so she could pick up the bottles of wine he ' d selected for this afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea why rai ##s wanted to test out the wines . [SEP]
[CLS] he entertained all the time and she did n ' t think he even cared what wines were served as long as they were of excellent quality . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps there was something about these specific vintage ##s that he wanted to try before serving . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe they were new or tricky . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t really have a big taste for wine but knew from her training which wines to select for various meals . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , she did n ' t care . [SEP]
[CLS] she would bill the man for every hour that she worked for him and maybe he would regret doing something so outrageous as asking her to organize his parties . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , as the hour approached when she would see rai ##s again , her nerves started getting the better of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d picked up several samples of wines , cheese ##s and various other interesting ideas for his first party and had them stored in large boxes , ready to take out to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t mind flying but she ' d never been in a helicopter before so this was going to be interesting . [SEP]
[CLS] at the he ##lip ##ort , she allowed the attendant to carry the heavy boxes to the waiting helicopter and she approached at a slower pace , not eager to get into the contra ##ption . [SEP]
[CLS] this one looked significantly larger than what she was expecting , even having the dun ##ari royal seal on the sides . [SEP]
[CLS] there were two big , bu ##rly men who were watching her approach and she suspected they were body guards for rai ##s , but why they would be here , she had no idea . [SEP]
[CLS] should n ' t they be out at the farm protecting him ? [SEP]
[CLS] she knew they were always there , but they guarded the inside of the main house and the perimeter of the property , rarely vent ##uring down to the stables . [SEP]
[CLS] the helicopter lifted off and rachel ' s stomach dropped out of her body . [SEP]
[CLS] she gripped the cases of wine in her right hand and the door handle in her left , praying silently that the pilot knew what he was doing . [SEP]
[CLS] it might take her two hours to get out to the farm by car , but when one did n ' t have to deal with traffic and red lights , or even rights and left ##s to get to the correct street , it was much faster . [SEP]
[CLS] the pilot simply flew over all the little ant sized cars below , flying directly to the farm and landing on rai ##s ' private he ##lip ##ad . [SEP]
[CLS] george , one of the older gardener ##s , was even there to meet her and carry the case of wine and the other box of del ##ica ##cies from the helicopter to the back of his truck . [SEP]
[CLS] it took less than thirty minutes to get from her office building to the main house and she was shaking the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s was standing on the front of the steps , watching as george drove her up the long driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled up at the front of the house , rai ##s walked down the steps and opened the door for her . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost did n ' t get out of the truck as she gazed at his victorious eyes , filled with intent that made her stomach muscles tighten even more . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` welcome back , rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand and pulled her up the steps and into the house . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel had been inside often over the years , but normally she entered through the kitchen door or the garage . [SEP]
[CLS] the main house was intimidating when coming in through the front , which was exactly his intent with most of his guests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why are you doing this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked when he brought her into the dining room where lucy already had a light lunch set out along with a whole tray of wine glasses ready for the wine tasting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' ll do the opening , ' ' he said to george who was preparing the first bottle for the tasting . [SEP]
[CLS] george nodded and bowed himself out of the dining room , even closing the doors as he left . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel saw that they were now alone and her shaking increased . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please do n ' t do this , rai ##s , ' ' she begged , her fingers knot ##ting the napkin on her lap . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked as he poured a small amount from the first bottle of wine . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t do . . . . this , ' ' she said , waving her hand between the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her and stilled for a long moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` help me understand why i should n ' t try and make love to the woman i ' ve wanted for so long i ca n ' t remember a time when i did n ' t want you in my bed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was a startling declaration but she focused on his first request . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not in your league , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t play by the same rules that you do . [SEP]
[CLS] when i have sex , it will mean something . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that declaration in ##fur ##iated him for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so all of your old lovers meant so much to you that you ' re still with them ? [SEP]
[CLS] its ' just me that you do n ' t want in your bed , is that it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and bowed her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you keep referring to my old lovers , but that assumption is n ' t accurate , rai ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how many ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded and placed her glass in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` taste this one . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s an excellent red . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ignored the glass and stared at her fingers instead . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` none , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] it was time to be honest with him . [SEP]
[CLS] maybe if he understood , he would stop his pursuit of her and let her just be content with the way her life was moving . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t move . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t even breathe for a long moment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you repeat that please ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said softly , firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to repeat it . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to run out of the house and hide from him again . [SEP]
[CLS] being here , seeing him again as the memories of those hands on her breasts saturday filtered into her mind , she had trouble focusing on anything other than that . [SEP]
[CLS] and what might have happened if she ' d stayed , if her fears had n ' t come up and overwhelmed her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t leaving her any choice though . [SEP]
[CLS] he stood there looking down at her , waiting . [SEP]
[CLS] her chin lifted just so he did n ' t think she was weak or embarrassed , which she was in this case but he did n ' t have to know that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have n ' t been with any other man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sat down heavily in the chair next to her , downed the small amount of wine he ' d poured in his glass , then poured himself another . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` explain please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stood up and took her glass of water , draining the glass as she looked out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you remember that afternoon a long time ago when i came home from school and saw devlin and dali ##a ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] they were two of the horses that were still on the farm , still producing excellent offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] he remembered it vivid ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] and he remembered how horrified she ' d been that afternoon crying out her fear for the mare who , in rachel ' s eight year old mind , was being brutally raped when in fact , the mare was just putting on a show for the stallion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember . [SEP]
[CLS] you were n ' t supposed to see those things . [SEP]
[CLS] your father was pretty angry with himself that day . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled , remembering her father ' s white face when he ' d gotten home that evening . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he tried to talk to me about it , but i was still too shocked . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d also cried that afternoon in rai ##s ' arms , begging him to stop devlin from hurting the poor mare . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d buried her face on his shoulder , sobbing out the pain for the female horse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he prompted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , ' ' she took a deep breath , ` ` i know , theoretically , that it is n ' t as brutal with humans . [SEP]
[CLS] but the truth is , i have n ' t really wanted to find out . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m too scared to test the activity . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m pretty sure i wo n ' t like having sex rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] so i ' ve pretty much avoided it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was quiet , absorbing what she was telling him . [SEP]
[CLS] when he finally spoke he was right behind her , his chest mere inches from her back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let me get this straight . [SEP]
[CLS] you have n ' t ever had sex with another man because you thought that sex with a man would be like mating was with devlin and dali ##a ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] and no man could match up to rai ##s ' man ##liness , she thought silently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that and other reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] but yes . [SEP]
[CLS] so when you want me to give you a number , i ca n ' t do that . [SEP]
[CLS] nor can i be casual about sex like you are . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her closer , kissing her shoulder softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think there would be anything casual when i finally get you into bed , rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she swung her head around , looking up at him with an anxious expression on her face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when ? [SEP]
[CLS] not if ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we will happen , my dear . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s going to be soon . [SEP]
[CLS] but i promise that you wo n ' t be scared and you will enjoy every moment of it along the way . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was thinking back to saturday morning and the way she ' d responded to his touch , begging him in her sleep to keep going . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , she would be doing that with him again . [SEP]
[CLS] very soon , he thought . [SEP]
[CLS] he dropped his hand and stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in the meantime , let ' s have lunch and you can help me decide on which wine to serve . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she breathed a bit easier now that he was walking back towards the lunch table . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought it was sweet that lucy had chosen the pink roses to decorate the table and she walked closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` these are my favorites , ' ' she said , touching the delicate petals of one of the perfect , pink roses with just a hint of red on the tips of each pet ##al . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember the day you brought this plant here to your rose garden . [SEP]
[CLS] i was so excited to see what it would be like after you described it to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i remember the day , ' ' he replied with a nos ##tal ##gic smile . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d made a special trip to german to find this particular rose , wanting to surprise her with it . [SEP]
[CLS] almost all of the roses had been his gift to her , although she did n ' t even know it . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was fourteen years old , he ' d hired a man to find a special rose bush for her . [SEP]
[CLS] when he saw how excited she was by the roses , how she preferred to do her homework in the rose garden , he ' d built up his collection of roses , trying to find unique and hardy flowers she might enjoy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the ones that have a stronger scent , but you want the ones with the most vibrant color . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel laughed and pulled her hand away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i used to love just laying in the garden and smelling the roses . [SEP]
[CLS] my dad would find me lying in the dirt , homework still not finished and he ' d drag me back to the stables so he could monitor me while i finished . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s remembered several occasions like that . [SEP]
[CLS] he would chuckle from his office window as he watched her father storm up to the rose garden , irritated that he ' d had to come look for her . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was always there . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` he used to call them ' damn girl ##y flowers ' whenever he found me over there . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled at the memory and sat down at the table , pulling the linen napkin onto her lap . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s opened another bottle of wine and poured a bit of the white into a glass . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t really like this white , but let me know what you think . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sq ##uin ##ched up her nose and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` a bit too dry and tar ##t for a dinner , do n ' t you think ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it goes well with cheese , ' ' he suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not everyone will be eating cheese , ' ' she pointed out . [SEP]
[CLS] bottle after bottle , they sipped and laughed over the various descriptions . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s already knew which wine he wanted at the first party , but it was a relaxing way to spend the afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] and he could tell that she was getting a bit tips ##y , which was even better . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her relaxed and enjoying herself . [SEP]
[CLS] he encouraged her to eat the bra ##ised chicken lucy had made them for lunch , and they both drank plenty of water to hydra ##te themselves and ate bread to keep the food in them . [SEP]
[CLS] but as the afternoon continued , he stopped opening new bottles and just kept topping off their glasses with the one wine they both enjoyed . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel knew the moment that the afternoon changed . [SEP]
[CLS] the relaxed feeling shifted slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] as did rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they had moved from the dining room table to the living room with the soft , leather sofa ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she realized suddenly that he was sitting much too close to her and , as she looked down at her legs , they were actually across his lap , her shoes tossed to the side and she was leaning back against the cushions . [SEP]
[CLS] and he was leaning over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you going to do ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , suddenly wary . [SEP]
[CLS] his handsome , firm mouth formed into a half smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i currently do n ' t have a plan of action besides just enjoying your laugh . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a sip of ice water , his eyes dropping to her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have very sexy lips , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll have to do better than that to seduce me , ' ' she said . [SEP]
[CLS] when she realized what she said , her eyes widened and she started to pull away . [SEP]
[CLS] he held onto her legs and shook his head slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think so , ' ' he commented casually . [SEP]
[CLS] but there was nothing casual about the way he was looking down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ve challenged me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shivered with the intent she saw in his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , really . . . i did n ' t mean to . . . ' ' she tried once again to pull her legs away but his hand stopped her and his touch was so intimate that she froze . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s the deal . [SEP]
[CLS] and bear with me because i ' ve been considering this all afternoon while you sat here and looked like the sex ##iest woman alive so there might be a few sal ##ient points to work out . [SEP]
[CLS] but we ' re going to go slowly , at your pace . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to learn to trust me , to show me what you like and do n ' t like when i touch you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she started to interrupt but he put a finger over her mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re not going to have sex today because you ' ve had too much wine , but very soon , i ' m going to make love to you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t want . . . ' ' ` ` and you ' re not going to lie to me and tell me that you do n ' t want me to make love to you , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip , her mind trying desperately to come up with an answer . [SEP]
[CLS] but with his hand on her upper thigh like that , and his massive chest leaning down over her but not touching , no pressure at all from that direction , she could n ' t form the words to deny his promise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good , ' ' he said when she remained silent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we ' re going to start today . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m going to kiss you and you ' re going to help me so that we do n ' t go too far . [SEP]
[CLS] when the panic starts to see ##p in , you ' re going to stop me , understand ? [SEP]
[CLS] but you ' re not going to stop me by running away . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said the words softly , slowly and seductive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] all the while , his hand on her thigh was moving up and down her skirt and she was painfully conscious that the material was moving higher . [SEP]
[CLS] very soon , he was going to feel the skin underneath her skirt and she was n ' t sure she could take that kind of en ##tic ##ement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and if i panic and start to run away ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she whispered , her hand moving to rest on top of his , stopping the movement and was relieved when he moved his hand lower . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remember ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re going to stop me when that feeling starts to show up and we ' re going to talk about it , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped when his mouth covered hers . [SEP]
[CLS] but this time , there was a difference . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s was just as bold , just as demanding , but there was a he ##sit ##ancy behind the kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] he was waiting for her , she realized . [SEP]
[CLS] and with that understanding , she felt more . . . accepting . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t say she was comfortable or relaxed because she rarely felt those kinds of emotions when she was near rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it was almost as if the excitement , the passion inside of him was leash ##ed somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] her hand reached up and touched his cheek , her fingers experimenting with touching him . [SEP]
[CLS] she shuddered with delight now that she knew this was n ' t going anywhere soon . [SEP]
[CLS] she could enjoy the way he touched her , the way he kissed her and rev ##el in the feelings without the fear or panic about what might come next . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped when his hand slid under her silk blouse and pulled away , but the control was still there when she looked him in the eye . [SEP]
[CLS] lifting her head , she kissed him once again , her mouth opening and he immediately took the opportunity to deep ##en the kiss , pushing her back against the soft cushions . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand moved higher , his fingers only ski ##mming along the skin of her stomach and ribs . [SEP]
[CLS] she wiggled underneath his hand , wanting a more intimate caress , but not sure how to get it from him . [SEP]
[CLS] and also not sure how much she could take . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s lifted his head , his eyes hot with the need but his jaw was firm with the control he was holding over that desire . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s what ' s going to happen rachel , ' ' he said and pulled up so he was no longer touching her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m going to take you home now and we ' re not going to touch each other until we ' re back at your place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was startled with that command and started to protest but he put a hand over her mouth to stop her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and here ' s why . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re wearing a silk shirt without buttons up the front . [SEP]
[CLS] the only way to progress further with what we ' re doing is for me to rip that shirt off of you and view those very lovely breasts that i want desperately to see once again . [SEP]
[CLS] but if i do that , i know that will snap you out of this haze of passion you ' re feeling , ' ' he said and even saw the desire in her eyes fade as the fear took over . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and sat up , lifting her with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so from now on , when we are together , you will wear something that buttons up the front . [SEP]
[CLS] understand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he commanded firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and pulled her so she was next to him , his hands on her waist and pulled her closer , forcing her stomach to feel what touching her had done to his body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know that you ' re afraid of what you ' re feeling right now , but there ' s no need rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re safe in my arms and i wo n ' t do anything right now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put his forehead against hers and took a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but stand very still right now so i can maintain control . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel froze . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so still she was even afraid to breathe until he lifted his head . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands were still laying softly against his chest but she would n ' t let her fingers even twitch , much less move along his strong , muscular chest to explore what was underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] something she was very curious to do . [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and his hands tightened on her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re not very good for my ego , my dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took another deep breath then stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s time to get you home , ' ' he said . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` pick whichever wine you prefer for dinner this friday night , ' ' he commented , taking her hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you work with lucy on the menu ? [SEP]
[CLS] there will be ten dignitaries here for dinner . [SEP]
[CLS] i have to fly out tomorrow but i ' ll be back in time for the meal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course , ' ' she said , slipping into professional mode with difficulty . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll have everything ready for the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get in touch with your assistant to get a list of the guests so there wo n ' t be any international incidents . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her once again , then nodded . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know you will be exceptionally lovely friday night . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wished he had n ' t said it in quite that way , but she did n ' t have time to figure out what he meant . [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand and led her out of the house and down to the he ##lip ##ad where he climbed in right behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] the pilot was waiting for them and they were airborne just a few minutes after they entered the helicopter . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was n ' t used to this kind of efficiency and was even more surprised when they landed on the top of a building only a few blocks from her apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] the elevator ride down took them to the street level where his guards were already stationed with a team of black suv ##s waiting to ferry her to her apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] she was uncomfortable with how much it was costing him just to take her home . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , this seems like a lot of effort when i can easily drive myself to and from your house . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not a chance . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s a long drive and i do n ' t want you making that kind of a trip when you ' ve had that much wine or even if it ' s late at night , which many of these events will last . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped when they were seated in the back of the suv and looked over at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there ' s an easy solution though . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she saw the mischievous look and knew she did n ' t want to hear it , but she laughed anyway and said , ` ` what ' s your idea ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just move in with me , ' ' he said easily . [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped , pulling back to get a better look at him . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that no other woman had ever stayed with him in that way . [SEP]
[CLS] for that matter , no woman had ever spent the night with him . [SEP]
[CLS] at least , she suspected that they did n ' t sleep over . [SEP]
[CLS] he generally took them out of the house and came back alone . [SEP]
[CLS] or that was her impression although she did n ' t have anything to back up that assumption . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i could n ' t do that , ' ' she finally said . [SEP]
[CLS] they were at her apartment now and one of his guards was holding the door open for the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] she went up in the elevator , awkwardly flanked by two bulky men and rai ##s , who still tower ##ed over his guards beside her . [SEP]
[CLS] she dug into her purse , wanting to escape this crazy escort home but as soon as she pulled out her keys , one of the guards took them silently and opened the door for her . [SEP]
[CLS] the other guard stood outside , holding rachel back while the first one entered the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] a few moments later , he came back out and nodded his head , bowing slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be right back , ' ' rai ##s said to his guards before he nudged rachel gently on the small of her back to get her moving inside the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] he closed the door and turned to face her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' ll get used to it , ' ' he assured her . [SEP]
[CLS] and then he took her into his arms , pressing her backwards so her back was against the wall and her chest was plastered against his . [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her for all she was worth , his mouth moving over hers sen ##su ##ously , deeply , teasing her until she responded . [SEP]
[CLS] her hands moved up his chest blindly , feeling all those things she had wanted to touch before but was too afraid to explore . [SEP]
[CLS] she rev ##ele ##d in his kiss , her body sliding against his , and she whimpered with the need for something she could n ' t define . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s pulled back with a groan . [SEP]
[CLS] he put his hands on her upper arms and stepped away from her , taking a deep breath as he looked down at her eyes that were now bright with desire . [SEP]
[CLS] he almost shook his head to keep himself from pulling her against him once again but he knew that he might not be able to stop if he started once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have to go , ' ' he growled out . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled a card out of his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s my private cell phone number . [SEP]
[CLS] call me if you need anything , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel reached up and took the card , her hands shaking violently after that kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] call , ' ' she whispered , curling her fingers around the card as she reigned in her own passion . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hand reached out once again , touching her stomach gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` remember . [SEP]
[CLS] front button ##ed blouse , rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t speak , too afraid of what might come out . [SEP]
[CLS] but she nodded her head , acknowledging his command . [SEP]
[CLS] after that , he left her apartment , closing the door softly and rachel stared at the soft light in her apartment , wondering how her life had gotten so crazy all of a sudden . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 4 rachel surveyed her appearance in the mirror , nervously smoothing the adrian ##na pa ##pel ##l gold satin material over her figure . [SEP]
[CLS] the satin shi ##mmer ##ed along her waist and hips , hugging her breasts with a sheer , em ##bell ##ished mesh neck ##line . [SEP]
[CLS] the edge of the material was high enough up on her chest that it did n ' t show even the slightest bit of cleavage but the mesh teased the eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] if one were to look more carefully , underneath the rhine ##stones was her own flesh and she worried that the dress might be too sexy for tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] oh , it was a perfectly acceptable dress for the social part of the night but was she teasing rai ##s too much with the neck ##line ? [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced back at the arm ##ani cocktail suit that had arrived yesterday by special messenger . [SEP]
[CLS] the tea ##l fabric shi ##mmer ##ed in the light from her bedside table and the rhine ##stone buttons on the jacket looked fabulous . [SEP]
[CLS] but she did n ' t want to wear something that expensive , or anything from rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she was uncomfortable enough with him flying her out to the party on his private helicopter , she could n ' t accept clothes from him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] especially a dress that probably cost a couple thousand dollars . [SEP]
[CLS] this dress was even more expensive than what she ' d planned to spend but she ' d seen it on the hangar and had sp ##lu ##rge ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] it had cost almost four hundred dollars , but she wanted to look pretty tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] not because she was going to see rai ##s , or because she wanted to impress him . . . . or even because she did n ' t want to em ##bar ##ras ##s him in front of his important guests . [SEP]
[CLS] she told herself that the only reason she ' d bought the dress was because this was a special occasion and she needed to look nice for her first big event in which she was the primary event coordinator . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d be able to wear this dress over and over again so it was really just a good investment . [SEP]
[CLS] okay , and it did n ' t have buttons going down the front . [SEP]
[CLS] she accepted this part mentally , but it still made her nervous . [SEP]
[CLS] every nerve ending in her body was tingling with excitement , wondering what rai ##s might do when she showed up with a b ##lat ##ant . . . challenge ? [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled , touched up her lipstick then grabbed the sleek , bo ##ler ##o jacket that came with the dress and her matching purse . [SEP]
[CLS] when she pulled the door to her apartment open , she jumped when she spotted the two men who were standing outside her apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped and stepped back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s going on ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the men bowed and stepped forward slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` his highness asked that we bring you to him tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to ensure your safety , ma ' am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s hand flew to her neck , astonished that rai ##s would do something like this . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t really need an escort . . . i ' m sorry , what ' s your name ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the first man bowed again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m ka ##dar and this is joe , ma ' am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel blinked and released a breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , ka ##dar and joe , thank you for the protection , but is n ' t this a bit of over ##kill ? [SEP]
[CLS] should n ' t you be out guarding rai ##s ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] the men did n ' t even flinch when she called their employer by his first name . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we have our instructions , ma ' am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her shoulders slumped and she looked down the hallway in both directions , worried that her neighbors would see this conversation and think someone was about to arrest her . [SEP]
[CLS] the two guards looked suspiciously like fbi agents , or at least the kind of agents that appeared in the movies or television shows . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you mind if i called rai ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] i just do n ' t think this is necessary . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` we are at your service , ' ' ka ##dar replied , again with a bow . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel looked at him curiously , but she backed up into her apartment , closing the door so she could have a private word . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled the card out of her purse that rai ##s had given her earlier in the week and glanced at the number . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her phone out and dialed , then waited impatiently for the man to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good afternoon , beautiful , ' ' he said as soon as he answered the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you wearing underneath the suit ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel blushed and was glad that he was n ' t around to see it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , why are two security guards standing outside my doorway ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked impatiently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they ' re supposed to escort you to my house . [SEP]
[CLS] did n ' t they explain that to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she heard the ed ##gin ##ess in his voice but ignored it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s what they said to me , but that does n ' t explain why you want them to escort me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because i want to ensure you ' re safety , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought we discussed this on monday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gritted her teeth , trying to ignore her impatience . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t need security guards , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] call them off . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i wo n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] and i need you to go with them . [SEP]
[CLS] they will escort you to the house , but once you ' re on my property , you ' ll be safe enough . [SEP]
[CLS] now answer my question . [SEP]
[CLS] what are you wearing underneath that blue suit ? [SEP]
[CLS] or are you going to make me find out on my own ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and looked out the sliding glass doors of her apartment , seeing the late afternoon sunshine streaming through . [SEP]
[CLS] she needed to hurry up and get out to his house , wanting to supervise the various vendors that were arriving to set up but if she did n ' t hurry , she ' d be late and that ' s when confusion settled in . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing she was n ' t going to win this argument with him , she smiled slightly as she said , ` ` do n ' t worry , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not wearing anything underneath the blue suit , ' ' she said with complete honesty . [SEP]
[CLS] with that , she snapped her cell phone shut and stuffed it back into her small clutch purse and walked back out to the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##dar and joe were still standing at attention in the hallway and she pulled her apartment door shut , twisting the lock to make sure it caught . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , i ' m ready to leave , ' ' she said with a smile , ignoring her phone that started ringing at that same moment . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew that it was rai ##s trying to reach her about her last comment and her grin widened but she did n ' t take her phone out of her purse . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time she reached the elevator , she heard ka ##dar ' s cell phone ring . [SEP]
[CLS] the man immediately pulled it out of his pocket and answered it in a language she did n ' t understand . [SEP]
[CLS] it sounded like arabic , but it could be any number of dialects or even the original language itself for all she knew . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##dar spoke rapidly but she had no idea what he said . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time the elevator reached the ground level , he had shut off his phone . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , her phone started ringing once again . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled it out of her purse and noticed that rai ##s was once again calling her . [SEP]
[CLS] with another laugh , she pressed the ignore button , then dumped the phone back into her purse and stepped into the back seat of the black suv . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to wink at ka ##dar who looked at her as if she ' d just lost her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] was she really the only person who was n ' t afraid of rai ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] well , that was n ' t exactly true . [SEP]
[CLS] she was terrified of the man , but for a whole different reason . [SEP]
[CLS] she smoothed the dress down over her knees and looked out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] when she felt her phone vi ##brate , indicating that she ' d just received a text message , she thought about ignoring it . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was n ' t the type of person who could do that . [SEP]
[CLS] besides , it could be her boss or one of the vendors with a question or a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] with a groan of irritation , and no small amount of tre ##pid ##ation , she once again pulled her phone out and looked at the screen . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , it was from rai ##s and her fingers shook as she read the words , ` ` pay ##back is hell . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip as she watched the city streets fly by . [SEP]
[CLS] they came to the same building she and rai ##s had descended from several days ago and she actually hesitated to get out when ka ##dar held the door for her . [SEP]
[CLS] it was all well and good to pull the tail of the tiger when he was far away . [SEP]
[CLS] but in less than twenty minutes she would be up close and personal . [SEP]
[CLS] with wo ##bbly knees , she stepped out , knowing she had a job to do . [SEP]
[CLS] this was n ' t a personal visit . [SEP]
[CLS] she would n ' t even be around him most of the evening , she reminded herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she would be supervising the vendors , looking through the meals in the kitchens , observing the bartender ##s and a myriad of different things . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath and stepped into the helicopter , taking a seat and nervously strap ##ping on her seat belt . [SEP]
[CLS] what could he do ? [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled and looked out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a great deal of work to do before the party began and he was n ' t even scheduled to arrive until a half hour before the event was to begin at which time she knew he would have to shower and change . [SEP]
[CLS] the helicopter set down fifteen minutes later and rachel already had her clip ##board out and was going over the details of the party . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes skimmed the vans lined up on the driveway , pleased to note that the fl ##oris ##t was already packing up , the cater ##er had arrived and looked like they ' d been here for a while , security was setting up their own perimeter and everything seemed to be going smoothly . [SEP]
[CLS] she walked in through the kitchen doorway , intentionally avoiding the main house just in case rai ##s had actually come back earlier than planned . [SEP]
[CLS] she bus ##ied herself with her initial check ##list but kept looking over her shoulder for the man in question . [SEP]
[CLS] after two hours , she was starting to relax . [SEP]
[CLS] the cater ##er was finishing up with the last of the meal , the dining room was set with places for twenty people , the technician had the music all set for the evening , all she had to do was press a button . [SEP]
[CLS] wine was open , flowers were in place , wait staff had arrived and were getting instructions . . . . she was doing a final walk through of the dining room and living room when a strong arm wrapped around her waist , lifting her up and carrying her into the smaller library . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel gasped at the first contact , but as soon as she realized it was rai ##s , she pressed her mouth closed , not wanting anyone else to realize that he ' d grabbed her like this . [SEP]
[CLS] when the library door slammed closed behind him and he released her from his strong grip , she spun around , intending to give him a lecture on how to treat her . [SEP]
[CLS] but the words never left her since he covered her mouth with his , kissing her hard while his hands pulled her skirt up , his knee sliding between her legs and she gasped with the intensity of desire that slammed into her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was n ' t satisfied with that either . [SEP]
[CLS] her bo ##ler ##o jacket was pulled off her arms and the zipper on the back of her dress slid down with determined hands . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time he lifted his mouth , her dress was bunch ##ed up around her waist and she was gasping for breath , her hands gripping the tu ##xed ##o material of his jacket and her eyes were closed , her body begging for him to continue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i like the fact that you think you can tease me , ' ' he said roughly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you did n ' t follow my instructions rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she opened her eyes slowly , her heart racing and her breathing ragged . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t care what he said , but she desperately wanted his hands back on her body , touching her . [SEP]
[CLS] when his leg shifted slightly , she gasped , her body jerking as the electricity , and something else she ' d never felt before , sparked up along her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] his fingers traced along the lace of her bra , one finger sliding inside to tease her already hard nipple and rachel bit down hard on her lower lip , her head falling back against the wall and she gripped his lap ##els harder , pulling him closer . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s looked down at the woman who had driven him nearly insane with desire this afternoon after her phone call and almost cu ##ssed out loud . [SEP]
[CLS] he had her exactly where he wanted her , completely ready and more than willing for him to finish what he ' d started . [SEP]
[CLS] but his guests would be here in less than ten minutes ! [SEP]
[CLS] damn ! [SEP]
[CLS] a part of him thought about calling every single person and telling them to just stay away , but he knew he could n ' t do that . [SEP]
[CLS] he pulled her dress back up , making sure that her pretty lace bra was back in place . [SEP]
[CLS] he then smoothed her skirt back down over her hips , kissing her much more softly . [SEP]
[CLS] he heard her breath , shaky and deep , and wanted to kiss her again , to bury himself inside of her but that would have to wait . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you look beautiful , ' ' he said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel kept taking deep breaths , hoping to somehow get herself back under control . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hard , but she finally released her hands from his jacket and stepped away from him , holding onto the back of a chair because her legs were too un ##stead ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she managed to say , relaxing her shoulders and trying to figure out how to walk once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did n ' t you wear the suit i sent to you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , moving in closer . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he should keep his distance , but she just smelled good and she felt even better . [SEP]
[CLS] she smiled , but looked away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it was a beautiful suit , ' ' she replied softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought so . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but it had buttons down the front . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked up at him , almost laughing at the irritation that fl ##itte ##d across his handsome face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you just wanted to show me your independence ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took a step backwards , almost laughing when he stepped right along with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it had nothing to do with my independence , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wanted you to know that i do n ' t follow orders well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she watched him , her eyes challenging him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and the suit was too expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t accept gifts like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head as he stalked her several more steps . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , you need to understand something about me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , almost laughing for some reason . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` when i give an order , i expect it to be followed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and if i do n ' t follow your orders ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] one eyebrow went up with that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` then you have to face the consequences . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was just about to reach for her when the doorbell rang . [SEP]
[CLS] she slapped a hand over her mouth as she watched his expression change from las ##ci ##vious to disco ##nce ##rted at his plans being foil ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her as he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you think it ' s funny ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she giggled . [SEP]
[CLS] he bent down low even as she leaned back over the back of the chair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t forget , there ' s always the end of the evening when the guests are gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , he straightened up and took her hand to lead her out of the library . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my clip ##board , ' ' she called out , trying to pull her hand away so she could grab her information . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you wo n ' t be using that tonight , ' ' he said and pulled her back , tucking her hand into his bent arm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` come along . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but , i need that to work , ' ' she argued . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re the hostess tonight , ' ' he countered . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no clip ##board . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to argue more , to explain that her job was to hang in the background and oversee the evening but he would n ' t let her go and george was already opening the front door to the first few guests . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` good evening , senator , ' ' rachel said , stepping into professional mode , trying to pretend that rai ##s was n ' t there . [SEP]
[CLS] the evening continued on but each time rachel tried to step away from rai ##s , he pulled her back by his side . [SEP]
[CLS] she enjoyed his company , not having witnessed the humorous side of rai ##s but he was incredibly funny when he set his mind to charming people other than long haired , brunette ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the evening was a fabulous success and rachel was proud of how well the vendors operated . [SEP]
[CLS] they had a few questions for her , which they whispered in her ear occasionally . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was able to handle everything without a hitch . [SEP]
[CLS] the only problem was when the guests started to take their leave . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t minded being on rai ##s ' arm while others were there to provide a buffer . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as their numbers started to d ##wind ##le , her nervous ##ness increased . [SEP]
[CLS] very carefully , while he was discussing a project one of the senators wanted to build in dun ##ari , she slipped her hand from his arm and walked over to the door that led to the kitchens . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how are things in here ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked lucy who was busy overseeing the cleanup from the cater ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` everything is just fine , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you did an excellent job and the food was delicious . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel walked over to lana , the cater ##er who had handled everything . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you so much lana . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a big night for me and you really pulled through . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] lana reached up and gave rachel a huge hug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m so glad you trusted me with this job . [SEP]
[CLS] i had a lot of fun . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re an excellent cook ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel came back . [SEP]
[CLS] lana ' s grin widened . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you go relax ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' ve been on your feet all afternoon . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll be finished here in about ten more minutes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so soon ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel asked , her voice breath ##y with nervous ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sure ! [SEP]
[CLS] we ' re fast ! [SEP]
[CLS] i have a fabulous staff who know how to get things done efficiently ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , lana almost danced off , excited that her first major party for a big client went so well . [SEP]
[CLS] that left rachel standing with lucy who was huff ##ing off to the dining room to start turning off lights . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel stood in the kitchen alone , her eyes worried ##ly looking around , trying to find something to do . [SEP]
[CLS] but everything was completely under control . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to speak with you , ' ' she heard rai ##s say right behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] she spun around , almost falling with the momentum but he caught her before anything embarrassing could happen . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought he might just kiss her right there in the kitchen in front of lucy and the whole catering staff . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , he dropped his hand and walked out of the area , assuming she would follow him . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel glanced around , caught lucy ' s eyes and cringed when the mother ##ly woman gave her a wink of encouragement . [SEP]
[CLS] there was nothing to do but follow him . [SEP]
[CLS] this was exactly what she ' d been trying to avoid all evening . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t be alone with him , did n ' t want to be alone with him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his voice commanded and she actually jumped , startled by the tone . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d never spoken to her like that . [SEP]
[CLS] with authority and . . . almost anger ! [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t done anything wrong except di ##so ##bey what he told her to wear tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] and she did n ' t consider that to be b ##lat ##ant di ##so ##bed ##ience . [SEP]
[CLS] not that she even owed him obedience , she told herself angrily . [SEP]
[CLS] shoving through the door , she was about to confront him with his irritating , authoritative voice , but she stopped short when she looked at him . [SEP]
[CLS] he was standing in the living room , his tu ##xed ##o jacket thrown over the back of the sofa , his tie hanging down on both sides of his neck and the first few buttons of his shirt undone . [SEP]
[CLS] to make the whole image better , or worse depending on one ' s perspective , he was holding two glasses of brandy in his hand , offering one to her . [SEP]
[CLS] this was at least safer , she thought as she stepped forward to accept the brandy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she whispered , then moved away from him , taking a position on the other side of the room . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the night went smoothly , ' ' he said and sat down on the leather sofa , watching her with hooded eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you did an excellent job . [SEP]
[CLS] very good food . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i told lana that i thought it was great , but i ' ll pass along your praise as well . [SEP]
[CLS] it will mean more coming from you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` probably not , ' ' he laughed softly . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes sliced over to him , not sure why he ' d said that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i mean , everyone who was here tonight basically worship ##s you . [SEP]
[CLS] they are all eager to do your bidding and please you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she flushed , feeling embarrassed by that kind of a comment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re ex ##agger ##ating . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not in the least . [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re a very good hostess . [SEP]
[CLS] not that i ever doubted you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of his statement , he was standing right in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re charming and interesting despite di ##so ##bey ##ing just about everything i tell you to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help the chuckle that escaped . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so stop trying to order me around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] one side of his mouth tilted up in a se ##mb ##lance of a smile . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s in my nature . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his hand slipped around her waist , drawing her closer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what am i going to do with you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she inhaled sharply when he pulled her against him , his dark eyes convey ##ing his desire for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe you could just enjoy my company before you head back to dun ##ari , ' ' she said softly , pulling her eyes away from his and staring at his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] she really did n ' t want him going back home , she thought with a touch of sadness . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted him here where she could laugh with him and talk with him . [SEP]
[CLS] just being in the same room with him was stimulating , although at times he terrified her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was without your beautiful presence for six years . [SEP]
[CLS] do you really think i ' m going to just leave you now that i have you right where i want you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped breathing with those words . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` where do you think you have me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked worried ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` in my arms . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned and took a sip of his brandy with his free hand , ` ` and in my house with no one else around . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] those words startled her and she looked back towards the kitchen . [SEP]
[CLS] they were too far away for her to see or hear anything but she suspected that he was correct . [SEP]
[CLS] her shivering increased and she gripped her brandy glass with both hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` would you take me home ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not before i kiss you , ' ' he replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d rather you did n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he chuckled and she felt that sound throughout her whole body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know , love . [SEP]
[CLS] but it ' s something i have to do . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused to let those words sink in as he looked at her dress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what are we going to do about this flag ##rant di ##so ##bed ##ience about my instructions on your attire tonight ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced down at her dress , then back up to him with a grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t take orders from you , rai ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head and bent lower so his lips were almost touching hers . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but i like it when you di ##so ##bey me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened and she started to pull back , but the arm around her waist was too strong . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you going to do about it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took another sip of brandy before setting it down on the table behind him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , there are a numbers of punishments i can do ##le out for a major in ##fra ##ction like that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] again , another giggle slipped out and she shifted in his arms so that her free arm was higher on his shoulder , almost wrapped around his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can you give me some examples ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she suggested . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` maybe i ' ll choose one over another . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked back at her ask ##ance . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you do n ' t get to choose your punishments , my dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took her brandy glass out of her hand and set it down next to his . [SEP]
[CLS] when both of his hands were free , he used one to take her other hand and place it on his shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because that would defeat the purpose of punishments , my love . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he bent low and kissed her neck , causing rachel to shiver and move closer to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she even tilted her head so he had easier access . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to get home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not before i kiss you , ' ' he countered , ni ##bbling on her collar bone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you ' re already kissing me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not kissing you where i want to kiss you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure where that was , and frankly did n ' t want to know . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved the way he touched her , the elect ##ri ##fying way she felt in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] no other man had even come close to making her feel this way and she shifted against his hard length , even feeling the pressure from his erection against her stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] the thought occurred to her that she actually wanted to hold him there , to feel him and explore that part of him . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t feel the zipper slide down her back but when he pushed the material off of her shoulders she looked up , confused . [SEP]
[CLS] at that moment , he covered her mouth with his and all the confusion was superseded by the desire for this one man . [SEP]
[CLS] the fear did n ' t even rear its ugly head and she kissed him back with everything she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] his hand slid down her spine , tick ##ling and teasing her . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers had been clenching at his shoulders , but with his touch , she felt em ##bold ##ened to touch him back , wanting to make him feel the same things she was feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] her arms came down from his shoulders and she slowly tested how to touch him . [SEP]
[CLS] when her fingers slid down his chest , she heard him groan and his arm tightened around her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] she really liked that and tried it again but this time , he lifted his head and kissed her hard , his tongue del ##ving into her mouth , teasing her to participate in the kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to push his tongue out but he captured her lower lip and bit her . [SEP]
[CLS] not hard , but enough to surprise her and her hands clenched on his chest before opening up again , running across his chest muscles once again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he growled and lifted his head , shaking it slightly before taking her hands and plaster ##ing them against his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] that was n ' t enough for her though . [SEP]
[CLS] she let her hands slide over to the buttons . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought she was being subtle , secretive but she desperately wanted to feel the skin underneath his shirt , to explore those muscles more intimately . [SEP]
[CLS] she released one button and her fingers tentatively touched his chest . [SEP]
[CLS] but it was n ' t enough and she released the next button . [SEP]
[CLS] she continued to reveal additional skin , her excitement building as her hands found more freedom to explore the actual man instead of the fabric that hid him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so absorbed in exploring his body that she did n ' t even realize that rai ##s had pushed her dress down to her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] when his hands cupped her breasts , she inhaled sharply and pulled back , closing her eyes just as she ' d done earlier in the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t think any longer and when his thumbs rubbed over her hard nipples , she whimpered with the need that was pool ##ing at her core . [SEP]
[CLS] she pressed her stomach against him , her legs shifting as her whole body searched for the und ##efined something that she always felt when she was with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , she was n ' t even aware of her hands ripping off his shirt , un ##car ##ing about the buttons or the material . [SEP]
[CLS] and when she finally had him free of that , when his hands pushed the lace bra off of her shoulder and his hands were free to roam her breast without the hind ##rance of the material , she cried out with the jolt , pressing her body closer to him , her legs rubbing against his . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re beautiful , ' ' he told her and bent low so that he could take her breast in his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] when he did that , she wrapped her arms around his head while her body tried to withstand this new feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never even believed something this intense could be real , but as his mouth suck ##led , his tongue la ##ved and his teeth ni ##pped at her breast , she whimpered again with the growing need that was swamp ##ing her senses . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please , ' ' she gasped and tried to pull his head away . [SEP]
[CLS] he allowed that , only so he could move to her other breast , cupping the tender globe in his hand while he teased and tormented . [SEP]
[CLS] he straightened up a moment later and pushed her dress down to her feet , then swung her around , lifting her up and placing her next to the chair . [SEP]
[CLS] with gentle , teasing fingers , he pulled the scrap of lace away from her hips , his hands sliding along her legs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` sit down , ' ' he ordered , then took her hands to push her gently into the chair while he knee ##led in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was n ' t sure what he was doing , but she did n ' t have a chance to figure it out . [SEP]
[CLS] because his hands slid up her legs once again , his fingers at her knees pulling her legs apart while his mouth moved back to her breasts , kissing and nu ##zzling , teasing her until she was pl ##ian ##t in his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands slowly opened her legs while his mouth traveled down her body . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt his fingers slide gently along her outer thigh , then her inner thigh . [SEP]
[CLS] when his finger touched her core she jumped and looked down at him , her hands gripping his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] when she started to push him away , he stopped her movement with the simple ex ##ped ##ien ##cy of sliding his finger inside of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so astonished at that feeling that her body jerked . [SEP]
[CLS] her hips actually pushed forward , taking more of his finger and sighing with happiness . [SEP]
[CLS] when he pulled his finger out , she shook her head , relieved when he pushed back into her . [SEP]
[CLS] he stretched her slightly when he put two fingers inside of her , but she did n ' t have a chance to worry about that because his mouth had already moved from her breast to that core , his tongue teasing her and she could n ' t believe the heat she felt with his tongue and mouth , teasing her like that . [SEP]
[CLS] a feeling was building inside of her and she could n ' t stop it , did n ' t want to . [SEP]
[CLS] as his fingers and mouth moved on and in her , she pressed against him , her body arching and pressing , shifting ever so slightly until she felt that feeling int ##ens ##ify , expand and then . . . everything sparked out , shining and waves of intense feeling , of pleasure like nothing she ' d ever experienced or knew about exploded around her . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s watched with a painful need as she experienced her first orgasm and he thought he might just die if he did n ' t bury himself inside of her immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] when her body collapsed , he lifted her into his arms and swung her around so that she was laying on the carpet . [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her legs , her thighs , that jun ##cture once again so he could enjoy her taste and smell , then moved higher , kissing her stomach and rev ##elin ##g in the perfection of her breasts . [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up quickly , grabbed a condom from his pocket as he stripped his slacks and shoes off before coming back down to knee ##l between her legs once again . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to stay just like that , to look at her in the aftermath of that climax , but he was in too much pain now . [SEP]
[CLS] he needed her with an intensity he ' d never experienced with a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] what was it about this slender female that drove him to such a desperate need to possess her ? [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t care at the moment . [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned over her , gently taking her lips , kissing her , teasing her , bringing her back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole time , he slid his finger inside of her again , closing his eyes at the heat , her wet ##ness and how tight she was . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to just bury himself in her but he knew he had to take this slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her stirring , he replaced his finger with his erection . [SEP]
[CLS] slowly pressing inside of her , watching her face the whole time . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes smiled up at him and her soft hands moved from the carpet beside her to his shoulders while her legs automatically moved up his leg , giving him more room , better access . [SEP]
[CLS] she shifted her hips , adjusting to him and he loved the way her eyes brightened once again . [SEP]
[CLS] but as he slid in deeper , her eyes became worried . [SEP]
[CLS] he stilled and reached down to kiss her gently , reassuring her with words he was n ' t even sure she understood . [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her hips move again , he pulled out and then pushed in a bit deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s continued the process until he felt her barrier and stopped , controlling his ramp ##aging need to push into her to the hilt . [SEP]
[CLS] sweat was forming on his back and forehead but he shook his head , trying to clear the lust away so he could concentrate on making this experience perfect for her . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , he had no idea what to do to help her through this pain and it tore at him to do this to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , i ' m sorry , ' ' he said , his hands diving into her hair with his elbows holding him above her . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard his words , saw the worry in his eyes and the panic well ##ed up inside of her . [SEP]
[CLS] everything until now had been so perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] she tensed , her eyes widening and she shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no , ' ' she gasped out and tried to slide away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have to stop now , ' ' she cried out . [SEP]
[CLS] he shook his head one more time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t , ' ' he said softly and a moment later , he pushed into her , feeling her slender body stiff ##en in his arms and he held still , forcing the desire away until she relaxed once again . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel bit her lip , unaware that her fingernails were digging into his skin . [SEP]
[CLS] gone was that need , that desire for the finish . [SEP]
[CLS] everything was gone except for the pain and she wanted to sob out her fear . [SEP]
[CLS] but slowly , the pain dissipated and she opened her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] feeling him fully inside of her was a new feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] she should be angry with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d asked him to stop and he had n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d broken his promise . [SEP]
[CLS] but as she looked up at the man , his eyes closed and every muscle in his body trying very hard to remain still , for her , she for ##ga ##ve him . [SEP]
[CLS] a warmth filled her and she relaxed her hands , her legs came next and he felt that . [SEP]
[CLS] his eyes opened and he looked down into her soft , smiling eyes and relaxed somewhat . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] her smile widened and she shifted slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] he let go of a deep breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank goodness ! [SEP]
[CLS] i do n ' t think i can hold off much longer . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] with that , he slid slightly out of her , testing her tenderness and was even more relieved when her eyes widened with the movement . [SEP]
[CLS] several more gentle movements and she closed her eyes once again , pressing her body against each thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s moved so that she had the best friction , shifting slightly to get a better angle , giving her as much pleasure as he could . [SEP]
[CLS] he watched her face , trying to read if some move was better or worse but everything he did just seemed to help her get closer . [SEP]
[CLS] when he felt her tightening he increased the pace and watched with fascination as her body arched and climax ##ed , her whole being involved in the pleasure . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , he could n ' t watch for too long . [SEP]
[CLS] her mind ##less pleasure pulled him in and he could n ' t stop his own orgasm from washing over him . [SEP]
[CLS] it felt as if every particle of tension was being pulled out of his body with the orgasm that swept him away with a pleasure that was so intense he could n ' t even think , just experience . [SEP]
[CLS] when he could move , he opened his eyes and looked around , then down at the tiny woman he was crushing underneath his weight . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately he lifted up and rested on his elbows , looking down at her smiling face . [SEP]
[CLS] even now , as she ran her fingers lightly over his back and shoulders , it felt incredibly good just to have her touching him after such a long wait . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , chuck ##ling at her del ##iri ##ous expression . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she qui ##pped . [SEP]
[CLS] he gently stood up , lifting her in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t believe we did this on the living room floor , ' ' he commented , shaking his head . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even bother to pick up their clothes , just carried her up the stairs to his bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you were trying to reassure me that this was n ' t going to happen . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he thought about that as he shouldered his way through the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that might have been in the back of my mind , ' ' he replied as he set her down in the middle of his huge bed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but now that you know it ' s going to happen again , what are you thinking ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and started to pull the covers over her naked ##ness but he only smirked and pulled the cover out of her hands , covering her with himself . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it ' s going to happen again ? [SEP]
[CLS] who says ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he mirrored her expression , not allowing her an inch . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i say . [SEP]
[CLS] and it ' s probably going to happen pretty soon , my dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped when she felt that he was telling her the truth . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my , ' ' she sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] he bent down low and kissed her neck , smiling at her response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh my indeed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 5 rachel woke up to the alarm clock ringing and slammed her fist down on top of it . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to wake up , she did n ' t want to go to work and she definitely did n ' t want to spend the week without rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d spent the weekend with him , feeling awkward when she went to visit her father in the stables saturday morning . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t even blink an eye when she wandered into the stall though and she wondered what he was thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] had rai ##s already discussed his plans ? [SEP]
[CLS] somehow that made the whole thing sound prem ##ed ##itated and she did n ' t like that . [SEP]
[CLS] but the weekend turned out to be a great deal of fun . [SEP]
[CLS] they went riding , had lunch with her father , dinner alone at the main house and she spent the whole weekend curled up in his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t go home until sunday evening , at which time , he ' d come back with her , even coming into her apartment and made love to her one more time in her own bed before he left her to return to dun ##ari for meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] the only good part was that she would have a chance to see him again this weekend when he returned for another dinner party on friday night and he ' d even asked her to accompany him to an embassy ball on saturday night so it looked like she ' d get to spend the next weekend with him again . [SEP]
[CLS] that thought had her rolling over in her bed , smiling up at the ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] she was eager to see him and be with him . [SEP]
[CLS] that probably was n ' t the safe ##st thing , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] but she pushed those reservations to the side , sweeping the covers off of her so she could start her day . [SEP]
[CLS] the week was long and ted ##ious , but by wednesday evening , she was eagerly preparing his house for his dinner party . [SEP]
[CLS] there would be more people this time , with his whole house filled with guests . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d even had to order a white tent for the backyard in order to hold more guests for the dinner and dancing he had planned . [SEP]
[CLS] her phone beside her elbow rang and she looked at the number . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully it was just len ##ora so she picked it up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi , what ' s up ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked cheerfully but was still si ##fting through all the notes on her desk . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` there are two big , beautiful boxes here that were just delivered for you , ' ' the receptionist explained . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was confused . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked at her calendar , trying to see if she was expecting something for the party that she ' d forgotten about . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are they ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , confirming that she had n ' t forgotten anything . [SEP]
[CLS] everything was supposed to be delivered to the farm so she could n ' t imagine anything coming here . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel told her she ' d be right there and hung up the phone . [SEP]
[CLS] picking up her notebook where she kept all the information on her events , she walked to the lobby , confused about what might have been delivered here accidentally . [SEP]
[CLS] when she reached the lobby , she saw the huge boxes with a giant ribbon on the front . [SEP]
[CLS] both boxes were long and flat with an exclusive department store label on the outside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` these look exciting ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] len ##ora was saying . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` open them here so i can see , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel smiled slightly but shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have no idea what these are but i ' d better get them out of here . [SEP]
[CLS] you know how derrick prefers his reception area to look nice and tidy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] len ##ora frowned , but knew that rachel was correct . [SEP]
[CLS] it was her job to get deliveries out of the reception area quickly so the white lines and punches of color were und ##ist ##urbed by extra ##neo ##us trash . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel carried the boxes back to her tiny office , ignoring the curious stares of her co - workers . [SEP]
[CLS] when she un ##tie ##d the ribbons and pulled off the top of the first box , her reaction was total stunned surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodness , ' ' she whispered in awe . [SEP]
[CLS] lifting up the material , she was shocked by the incredible dress that was wrapped in tissue paper . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a stunning emilio pu ##cci evening gown done completely in black lace with an under dress of shimmering gold . [SEP]
[CLS] the dress would hug her figure from her shoulders to mid - thigh and then it flared out to her toes . [SEP]
[CLS] it was so beautiful she could n ' t believe that she was actually holding such a masterpiece . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard someone gasp from her doorway and looked up . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that an emilio pu ##cci ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda whispered with rev ##erence ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] it was just delivered . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda , one of the other junior coordinator ##s that rachel occasionally had lunch with , stepped into her office and touched the black lace . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` how can you afford something like this on our salary ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s something like four thousand dollars ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s eyes snapped up to her friend ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you serious ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gasped . [SEP]
[CLS] linda only nodded , her eyes remaining on the gown . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` positive . [SEP]
[CLS] i was looking at it just last weekend , dr ##ool ##ing over the dress . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up with eager ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s in the other one ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , almost whispering . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel carefully tucked the black lace dress back into the box , gently covering it with the tissue paper before pulling the second box forward . [SEP]
[CLS] when she opened this one , she felt as if her eyes were going to pop out of her head . [SEP]
[CLS] the ak ##ris gown was almost too beautiful to touch . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a bo ##dice cut made up in glowing pink silk that would hug her chest , ski ##m along her hips and then flare out to the floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that one is n ' t four thousand , ' ' linda sighed , her fingers delicately touching the material . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank goodness , ' ' rachel replied , almost afraid to pull it out of the box but linda ' s re ##ass ##urance had her taking it gently and holding it up to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did n ' t even dr ##ool over that one . [SEP]
[CLS] it was in a glass case at the store . [SEP]
[CLS] i think it was closer to twelve thousand dollars , ' ' she explained . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that kind of dress is so out of my league i did n ' t dare get close to it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel almost dropped the dress with the news that the one dress could cost so much money . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t even sure she made half that much in a month ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who sent you these ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda asked , moving forward to peek into the box . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel did the same , spotting the card as she shuffled the tissue to pull it out of the box . [SEP]
[CLS] her fingers were shaking as she opened the envelope . [SEP]
[CLS] she had a suspicion on who sent these dresses and she was almost dread ##ing having those suspicions confirmed . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as she read the note her heart sank with the confirmation that rai ##s had sent both of them to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ca n ' t wait to see you in these , ' ' linda said , reading the note over rachel ' s shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who is ' r ' ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was so furious that he thought it was okay to buy her things like this that she wanted to st ##omp her feet . [SEP]
[CLS] how dare he treat her like a mistress ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just a jerk , ' ' rachel replied angrily and shoved the envelope back into the box . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to do the same with the dresses , but the expense of both made her treat the dresses with more care . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they are definitely going back . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re kidding , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda asked , watching her friend with amazement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not kidding at all , ' ' she said and closed the box . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not for sale ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] linda walked out of the office , shaking her head at rachel ' s attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` if you do n ' t want the guy , let him know that i ' m definitely for sale for those kinds of gifts . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel barely heard her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was too busy digging her cell phone out of her purse and dial ##ing the phone number rai ##s had given to her . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , the call went to his voice mail and she had to ignore the shiver of excitement that tore through her when she heard his deep voice telling her to leave a message . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s , i refuse to be treated like this ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she said as her message . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sending them back and please do n ' t ever do that again ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ended the call and tried to hold back the tears . [SEP]
[CLS] she packed up the boxes then picked them both up as well as her purse . [SEP]
[CLS] she stormed out of the office with the dresses in her arms telling len ##ora that she was going out for lunch . [SEP]
[CLS] she was driving out of the parking garage when his call came back so she pulled over and took the call . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong , beautiful ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] she squeezed her eyes closed as the humiliation washed over her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why did you do this ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her voice sounding funny even to her ears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do what , love ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she ignored the ins ##in ##cer ##e end ##ear ##ment and focused on trying to see through the tears . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` the dresses , rai ##s ! [SEP]
[CLS] why did you buy me the dresses ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , ' ' he replied , finally understanding . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i knew that you would be with me for the two events this weekend and i did n ' t want you to have to worry about spending your money on dresses when you are helping me . [SEP]
[CLS] was it so wrong to buy something beautiful for you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stated em ##pha ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t understand , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] but let ' s talk about it this weekend , okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] i have to go to another meeting . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s fine but i ' ll be wearing my own clothes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused slightly with her declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i would love to see you in the dresses i sent you . [SEP]
[CLS] i picked them out myself . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that hurt and she squeezed her eyes shut , un ##car ##ing that her mascara would probably be a mess after this conversation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not for sale , rai ##s , ' ' she said softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i never thought you were , rachel . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t buy me with expensive dresses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was n ' t trying to , honey . [SEP]
[CLS] i just thought you would look pretty in those and i wanted to do something nice for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he paused to let that sink in before he said , ` ` could you look at it slightly differently ? [SEP]
[CLS] i was thinking about you and wanted to show you . [SEP]
[CLS] i chose those dresses out of several other options because i thought they were something you would like and would look lovely on you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] put that way , it did n ' t sound so bad . [SEP]
[CLS] it was even a nice sentiment . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dammit rai ##s ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that mean you ' re going to keep the dresses ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not necessarily . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , that ' s at least an improvement from sixty seconds ago , ' ' he replied dryly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ca n ' t do this kind of stuff . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s my money and i want to spend it on you . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s the problem ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath and let it out slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because it ' s just not fair . [SEP]
[CLS] i ca n ' t do anything along these lines and i feel . . . . like i owe you now . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t even think like that , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you do n ' t owe me anything . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wanted you to know that i think you ' re as beautiful as the dresses . [SEP]
[CLS] more so actually . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she dropped her head on the steering wheel . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re inc ##or ##ri ##gible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i know . [SEP]
[CLS] so will you wear them this weekend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because they cost too much . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` not for me , ' ' he came back . [SEP]
[CLS] she was silent for a long moment while she tried to come up with a response . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s . . . ' ' she started to say but he interrupted her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel , let ' s talk about this when i can see your face . [SEP]
[CLS] i would love to see you in those dresses , or more specifically , i would love to take you out of those dresses , slowly and with a great attention to detail . [SEP]
[CLS] but if you have something else you would like me to take off of you , i ' m more than willing to compromise . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was about to contra ##dict him before he ended in that manner . [SEP]
[CLS] it was so typical of him that she could n ' t help but laugh despite her frustration with his high handed manner . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re inc ##or ##ri ##gible , ' ' she came back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , but you want me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed again and wiped her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m promising nothing . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` promise me that you ' ll spend the weekend with me again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no . [SEP]
[CLS] you deserve to wait and wonder after this stunt . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why is giving you a nice dress or two a stunt ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and rolled her eyes at his ob ##tus ##enes ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first of all , because you delivered those dresses to my office and now everyone is gossip ##ing about me , probably assuming that i ' m sleeping with a client . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you are sleeping with a client , ' ' he came back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have slept with a client , but that might not ever happen again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his laugh was deep and sexy and she could just picture him leaning back against a big , leather chair like the one in his office at the main house , his feet propped up on his desk as he smiled that handsome smile of his that never failed to make her stomach quiver in anticipation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' d like to see you try and resist me now that you know what an incredible lover i am . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that comment caused her amusement to di ##ssi ##pate . [SEP]
[CLS] it reminded her that this man had a great deal of experience and she hated the thought of him with other women . [SEP]
[CLS] especially the women she ' d seen him with in the past because they all looked like her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let ' s talk this weekend , ' ' she said , all humor gone from her tone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds ominous . [SEP]
[CLS] what just happened rachel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , much more alert . [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` like you said , it ' s hard to talk when you ' re thousands of miles away , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll get there as soon as i can . [SEP]
[CLS] but next weekend , we do n ' t have any events , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you have n ' t scheduled anything , ' ' she replied cautiously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you want something on the calendar ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she felt herself tens ##ing , worried that she would n ' t see him if he did n ' t have a social obligation here . [SEP]
[CLS] that did n ' t sit well with her , even though she ' d just been upset about him and the women he had been with in the past , and those he most likely would be with in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i was thinking that maybe you could come out to visit me this time around . [SEP]
[CLS] i would love to show you my home . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you mean your palace ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` whatever you want to call it . [SEP]
[CLS] i only occupy a portion of the building in which i work . [SEP]
[CLS] there ' s more than a residence here . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' re the ruler so most of it is reserved for your personal use , is n ' t it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you come out next weekend and i can show you everything . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about it for a moment , biting her lip nervously . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s . . . ' ' ` ` do n ' t say no . [SEP]
[CLS] just think about it . [SEP]
[CLS] we ' ll add it to the numerous other topics we need to discuss this weekend , okay ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she released her lip and stared up at the roof of her car . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a painfully complicated relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ll see you friday . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll be there as soon as i can . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i lo . . . . ' ' she started to say something , then stopped herself , shocked at what she was about to say . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` see you soon . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she pressed the end button quickly , not sure if he ' d caught her comment . [SEP]
[CLS] she stared at her phone , wanting to text him and tell him that she had n ' t been about to say ' love ' but she did n ' t want to get into that . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , she received a text from him . [SEP]
[CLS] all it said was , ' back at you ' . [SEP]
[CLS] what did that mean ? [SEP]
[CLS] what was coming back to her ? [SEP]
[CLS] was he teasing her about her almost ' love ' comment or just about seeing her soon ? [SEP]
[CLS] her head fell back against the head rest again and she took a deep , calming breath . [SEP]
[CLS] back up in her office , she sat down behind her desk and stared at all of her sticky notes . [SEP]
[CLS] how was she supposed to focus when she knew she had sixteen thousand dollars worth of clothes in her car ? [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have time to drive to her apartment and be back in time . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , feeling as if the office were different somehow . [SEP]
[CLS] was it just because of her phone call with rai ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] had his voice completely altered her perception of her reality ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure , but she had things to do , vendors to schedule and confirm . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have time to dwell on her life right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hear someone has had a very interesting morning , ' ' derrick commented as he strolled into her office . [SEP]
[CLS] he looked around and noticed the small space with the older chairs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dear , since you have our biggest client , it seems as if you should also have a bigger office . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel swallowed uncomfortably . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t feel as if she ' d earned this promotion since she ' d known rai ##s all her life . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i should be honest with you . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s is a personal friend of my father ' s , ' ' she confessed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s why i have these parties . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick waited another moment , then shrugged . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel leaned forward , confused by his calm demeanor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and , i have n ' t earned a bigger office , derrick . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not as experienced and i feel as if i ' ve cheated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` dear , this business is all about making connections . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t worry at all that you had a connection through your father . [SEP]
[CLS] how do you think i started this business ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel had no idea actually so he continued on . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i did all of my mother ' s parties . [SEP]
[CLS] when her friends saw how nice everything looked , they asked me to do their parties . [SEP]
[CLS] so in effect , you ' re doing almost exactly what i did . [SEP]
[CLS] go with it , fl ##au ##nt it , honey ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel still felt awkward . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i suppose , ' ' she said non - commit ##tal ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` anyway , everything seems to be going well for friday ' s party . [SEP]
[CLS] this one is bigger but everything seems to be in place . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re using my cater ##er this time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , his eyes ad ##mon ##ishing her because he knew that she had n ' t used his personal preference for last week ' s event . [SEP]
[CLS] she took a deep breath before reply ##ing , ` ` actually , i ' m going with the same cater ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' s a personal friend of mine from college and even rai ##s complimented her on the food . [SEP]
[CLS] she has a very creative mind and you wo n ' t believe what she has planned for this weekend . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she handed him the menu and waited anxiously as he read through the details , her shoulders dropping with relief when his eyebrows shot up in surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that sounds heavenly ! [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s her name ? [SEP]
[CLS] and can i use her for other parties ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel laughed with relief at his approval . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely ! [SEP]
[CLS] i ' ve already given her the dates for my current set of events so i have her booked , but i ' m sure she ' d love your business as well . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick smiled and nodded his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` now . . . . about these dresses that arrived today . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s shoulders went right back to tens ##ing again , wary of where this conversation might go now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . . . . the dresses . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` spill it , dear . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rai ##s sent them , ' ' she admitted , relieved to have it out in the open , but still concerned about what the dresses might imply . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and why did he send dresses that cost so much ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip and looked across her desk warily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because he thought i would look pretty in them and he did n ' t want me to be embarrassed by the others who would be attending . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] derrick absorbed that explanation with narrowed eyes , nodding his head . [SEP]
[CLS] after several moments of silence he asked , ` ` is there anything i should be concerned about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel thought about how to answer that . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` possibly , ' ' she admitted . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but i ca n ' t be sure . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] in her mind , she knew she was tread ##ing on dangerous ground but she was n ' t sure how to explain to her boss that she was sleeping with a client . [SEP]
[CLS] it was n ' t against the rules , but in her mind , it did n ' t seem like it was a very ethical place to be either . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` reading between the lines , i ' m guessing you mean that you ' re in an intimate relationship with the man , correct ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she said honestly ` ` and you understand the ten ##uous position you ' re in ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` more than you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and nodded his head several times , going over the issue in his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , he looked up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` here ' s how this will work . [SEP]
[CLS] if you continue this relationship and it does n ' t impact the business or your performance , then i know nothing about this issue . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was astonished . [SEP]
[CLS] she was sure she ' d be fired about now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why would you make an exception like this for me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked as he stood up and started to walk out of her office . [SEP]
[CLS] he turned around and looked down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` because you ' re not like the others , dear . [SEP]
[CLS] if anyone else on my staff were sleeping with a client , it would most likely be because they were mercenary and trying to seal the deal on future business . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s just tack ##y , ' ' he explained with disdain . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` it also means they are n ' t very good at their job because they needed to add incentives that are n ' t on our special ##ties list , shall we say ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took a moment to laugh at his own joke . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but in your case , if you ' re sleeping with the guy , you ' re in love with him so it ' s not tack ##y , it ' s very sweet and romantic . [SEP]
[CLS] and i sincerely hope that things go well for you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he was almost out the door when he stopped and turned back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` just let me know as far in advance as possible if you ' re going to leave the firm for any reason , okay ? [SEP]
[CLS] you ' re a very good coordinator and it will be hard to replace you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel stared at the door , completely dumb ##founded by his words . [SEP]
[CLS] she had no idea how long she sat there staring at the empty doorway but her mind had a very hard time trying to wrap itself around the idea of being in love with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] was it possible ? [SEP]
[CLS] she dismissed it as lu ##dic ##rous and turned to face her computer screen , but her eyes could n ' t focus on what was in front of her . [SEP]
[CLS] she was still mu ##lling over the idea that she was in love with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d known each other for so long . . . . but love ? [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s crazy ! [SEP]
[CLS] no , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she was merely in ##fat ##uated with him just as she ' d been starting at sixteen . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t love him , she told herself firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] love would mean caring and being emotionally invested . [SEP]
[CLS] this was just an affair . [SEP]
[CLS] he would get over her and . . . . she could n ' t go on from that thought because it hurt too much . [SEP]
[CLS] she pushed the idea of rai ##s moving on to another woman out of her mind and focused on the tasks she had to deal with right now . [SEP]
[CLS] she had er ##rand ##s to do , vendors to check on . [SEP]
[CLS] she had to visit each of the vendors this week to ensure that they were ready and able to get everything prepared on time and she did n ' t just assume that they were making their deadline ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d learned from past experiences to check up on them at intervals the week before the party . [SEP]
[CLS] the flowers should already be at the fl ##oris ##t by now , lana should have most of the meal prepared except for the items that needed to be steamed fresh . [SEP]
[CLS] as she made her way to each of the vendors for friday ' s event , she thought about what derrick had said , her mind going over and over the possibility that she was in love with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully , some of the vendors had some problems that she needed to deal with so it was a distracting day . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , there were several emergencies that crop ##ped up that week , leaving her exhausted by the end of each day . [SEP]
[CLS] she checked her cell phone too , hoping that perhaps rai ##s might call her . [SEP]
[CLS] she just wanted to talk to him , but she did n ' t make the call herself , knowing that he was a very busy man . [SEP]
[CLS] however tired she was at the end of each day just trying to get a party together , he was probably pretty wiped out after having to deal with the problems of an entire country . [SEP]
[CLS] by thursday afternoon , she knew that the party was going to be wonderful . [SEP]
[CLS] all the issues had been dealt with , the ice sculpture was perfect and freezing , the food was delicious as expected , the flowers were ready to be transported and the tent was already constructed with the tables set up . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d refused to utilize the helicopter rai ##s had left at her disposal . [SEP]
[CLS] she just could n ' t get past the expense of the machine but she thought it was very nice that he ' d offered it to her to save her time . [SEP]
[CLS] the drive out to the farm would n ' t be too bad because she ' d leave about three o ' clock to inspect the site , then have dinner with her father and spend the night , driving back to her apartment in the early morning to avoid commuter traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] there was one thing bothering her though . [SEP]
[CLS] all week , she kept feeling as if someone was watching her . [SEP]
[CLS] she actually spotted a man leaning against a car one morning . [SEP]
[CLS] he appeared to be reading a newspaper , but when she glanced back at him , he was looking right at her . [SEP]
[CLS] wednesday , she saw another man sitting in a coffee shop outside of the floral shop she ' d contracted for the event and by thursday afternoon , she suspected that the same man from tuesday was following her out to the farm for the final inspection . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d visited with her father that evening , but left out the back exit of the farm to get home , just trying to be cautious . [SEP]
[CLS] it was six o ' clock when she got back on the road this morning and she was proud that she had n ' t been followed . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t mentioned her suspicions to anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t wanted to worry her father and she was afraid rai ##s would take her off of the event if he knew someone might be following her . [SEP]
[CLS] so she kept the issue to herself . [SEP]
[CLS] by thursday evening , she was feeling a little silly for being so paranoid , but could n ' t shake the feeling that she was being followed . [SEP]
[CLS] when she drove into the parking garage at her apartment , she actually took the stairs to her floor . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen a dark car parked on the opposite side of her parking space with a man in a dark coat sitting inside reading a newspaper . [SEP]
[CLS] it looked odd because rachel did n ' t think there was enough light in the dim garage to read the newspaper . [SEP]
[CLS] she was out of breath when she slipped into her apartment and peered through the pee ##p hole , wondering if she could see anyone who might be trying to spy on her . [SEP]
[CLS] was she being crazy ? [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced through the glass one more time , then sighed with relief when no one walked by . [SEP]
[CLS] she sagged with relief , dropping her purse on the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] she felt weird because normally she would have stopped by the lobby to get her mail but she ' d avoided that area today , preferring to just hi ##ber ##nate in her apartment , wanting that odd feeling to go away . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s out there that is so interesting ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] a deep voice asked . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel screamed and jumped about a foot in the hair , her hands reaching out to steady herself as she looked for the voice . [SEP]
[CLS] it was familiar , but rai ##s was n ' t supposed to be back until tomorrow afternoon so it could n ' t be him here tonight ! [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s asked , coming out of the darkness towards her , turning on lights as he walked . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded , his dark eyes looking down at her with both anger and concern . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel ' s hand went up to her chest as if to slow her racing heart . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` goodness ! [SEP]
[CLS] you scared me ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grumbled , her body still in fight or flight mode and her head almost light ##head ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] adrenaline and no food were not a good combination she thought as she took a deep breath to try and calm herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing here ? [SEP]
[CLS] and how did you get into my apartment ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] she was excited to see him , but still jump ##y because of the people she ' d seen around the city . [SEP]
[CLS] he ignored her question and pulled her into his arms . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t fight it because he was strong and secure and he held her tightly , decreasing the shivering until it was only a mild irritation . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s going on ? [SEP]
[CLS] why are you so scared ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he demanded , his arms tightening around her . [SEP]
[CLS] his cell phone rang once and he answered it quickly , speaking into the phone in arabic , just a few words before he ended the call and slid the phone back into his pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , i ' m just being silly , ' ' she said and leaned against him . [SEP]
[CLS] now that the scare was passing , she was over ##joy ##ed that he was here with her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but what are you doing here ? [SEP]
[CLS] you were n ' t supposed to fly in until tomorrow . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i canceled my meetings tomorrow , telling my advisors that i had priorities here . [SEP]
[CLS] they all understood , ' ' he explained , leaving out that he ' d told them that he was trying to convince this woman to marry him . [SEP]
[CLS] they were all eager for him to be married , telling him it should have happened years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] he bent down and kissed her neck , feeling her shivers increase and smiled to himself because this was for a different reason . [SEP]
[CLS] not that he was n ' t going to get down to the other reason , but she smelled too good right now , too distracting . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i want to hear all about your week , but first , i need you naked and in my arms , ' ' he said as he lifted her up , tossing her legs in the air and carried her into her bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he laid her down in the middle of her bed , then joined her , slipping her shoes off at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i missed you , ' ' he growled into her ear before biting it softly . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel smiled and lifted her arms , wrapping them around his shoulders , feeling as if she ' d just come home . [SEP]
[CLS] and if that little voice na ##gged at her that she was becoming too involved , too excited to see him , she ignored it and kissed him back , showing him how much she missed him and how happy she was to have him back with her . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 6 ` ` i have to go to work , ' ' she whispered , the dawn just starting to break over the horizon . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no you do n ' t , ' ' he countered and pulled her closer , nu ##d ##ging her back down to the mattress . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you need to stay right here with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed , feeling her sore limbs reach out for him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to hate my bathroom , ' ' she told him when she slipped out from under his arm . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s let his head drop down onto the pillow , wondering what he could do to get her back into bed with him and forget about the day and their respective responsibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked sexy as hell as she pulled that silk robe over her naked body but he thought she looked even better on the bed next to him without it . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed , knowing she was too responsible to lure back to bed . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t like the result , but he respected her work et ##hic . [SEP]
[CLS] rolling onto his back and stuffing pillows behind him , he watched as she walked out of the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] he assumed she was stopping in the kitchen to make some coffee . [SEP]
[CLS] at least he hoped she was . [SEP]
[CLS] he could really use a cup and he had no idea how to get it other than her making it or him calling down to his guards to bring some up . [SEP]
[CLS] and he did n ' t think she ' d like it if he called his guards . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` coffee is brewing , ' ' she said as she drifted back into the bedroom , only to disappear once again into the bathroom and closed the door . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled las ##ci ##vious ##ly as he contemplated her disappearance . [SEP]
[CLS] he really should be a gentleman and leave her to shower in peace . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d probably finish much more quickly if he just stayed put . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , he realized that he really was n ' t much of a gentleman . [SEP]
[CLS] throwing off the comfort ##er when he heard the shower start , he walked into the bathroom , completely un ##con ##cer ##ned with his naked ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] he surprised her as she was ri ##ns ##ing her hair and jumped when she felt his hands on her waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you woke up too early , ' ' he explained , letting his hands slide up her slick body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought i could help you out with your shower . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she thought about telling him to get out because she knew with absolute certainty that he would not help her in any way . [SEP]
[CLS] but as soon as his hands slid along her skin , she was lost once again in his sensual spell . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe how many times he ' d brought her to a screaming orgasm last night , almost embarrassed and wondering if her neighbors had heard them . [SEP]
[CLS] and now he wanted more ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re ins ##ati ##able , ' ' she gasped , but her arms were already winding around his neck , completely ready for another round with this man . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` only for you , ' ' he said as he ni ##pped her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] he picked up the soap and la ##ther ##ed his hands before smoothing them all over her arms and back , making sure she was completely la ##ther ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] along the way , he touched her everywhere , driving her insane with his hands and his touch . [SEP]
[CLS] when she tried to pull back , unable to take anymore , he reached outside of the shower , picked up the foil packet and sheath ##ed himself in the condom . [SEP]
[CLS] with a def ##t move , he lifted her into his arms and smiled when she automatically wrapped her legs around his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] he slowly lowered her onto him , watching her face as he imp ##ale ##d her on his shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you feel incredible , ' ' he groaned , turning to lean her shoulders against the tiles so he could clasp her hips . [SEP]
[CLS] lifting her up , then slowly lowering her down , he began the rhythm that never failed to get her started . [SEP]
[CLS] as he increased the pace , he could feel her body tighten , cl ##amp around him and he sped up , pushing her higher and higher . [SEP]
[CLS] when she splinter ##ed apart , her climax took him right along with her and he just about tumbled both of them to the shower floor . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t move , ' ' he ordered , his body still shuddering from her amazing body . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re amazing , ' ' he said as he tried to regain his breathing . [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed , pushing the hair out of her eyes as she looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t recall doing a great deal of work here in the past few minutes , ' ' she said , referring to the fact that he ' d done all the heavy lifting . [SEP]
[CLS] but she followed his command and stayed as still as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` can i put my legs down now ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she suggested , teasing him for maintaining their position . [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are you saying you ' d like to be able to walk on your own ? [SEP]
[CLS] without my help ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m not sure i can walk , but perhaps you ' d like a bit of my weight taken off of your own legs ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he nu ##zzled her neck , making her laugh . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` individual ##ity is over ##rated . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she giggled once again but pushed against his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] when he stepped back slightly , she lowered her legs to the shower floor , grateful for his arms that stayed around her to help her regain her balance which was n ' t so easy after that episode . [SEP]
[CLS] when she finally had her balance , she stepped back , self - conscious suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed the sham ##poo and used some in her hair , turning her back to him so he could n ' t see her face ` ` you ca n ' t hide from me , you know . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he said it softly , but there was a firm ##ness in his voice that told her he was n ' t going to let this thing go . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what happened to the smiling woman of moments ago ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked as he slid his hands into her hair to help her sham ##poo . [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed , bracing her hands against the sides of the shower stall . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` she ' s very happy in the th ##ro ##es of passion but when that sub ##side ##s , a self - consciousness emerges that is hard to ignore . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed and pulled her against him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what can i do to help you get over this self - consciousness ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she turned and looked over her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` give me clothes ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he raised an eyebrow . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` wo n ' t they get wet ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and threw her wash ##cloth at him . [SEP]
[CLS] missing of course and then he had to grab her around the waist . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you just toss this at me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked with an evil tone . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel could n ' t help it . [SEP]
[CLS] playful rai ##s was just too new to her . [SEP]
[CLS] they used to laugh and tease each other , but because she ' d avoided him for so many years , she ' d forgotten this side of him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think i did , ' ' she muffled , and then screamed out because he smacked her on the bottom , not hard but enough to sting and get her attention . [SEP]
[CLS] her eyes widened and she looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` did you just span ##k me ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , not sure if she should be horrified or turned on . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled smug ##ly down at her . [SEP]
[CLS] before he responded , he grabbed her wrists in each of his hands . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i did . [SEP]
[CLS] what are you going to do about it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he challenged , his eyes ali ##ght with mischief . [SEP]
[CLS] she licked her lips and shook her head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t you let my hands go and i ' ll show you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he laughed softly and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think that would be a very good idea . [SEP]
[CLS] you threw your wash ##cloth at me , madam . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s tan ##tam ##ount to treason in dun ##ari . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she shrugged but she was trying hard to sm ##oth ##er her own laughter . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what ? [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m not afraid of you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that answer caused his eyes to widen . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you should be afraid , ' ' he caution ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] she tried to yank her hands free , but he had a very good grip on her hands . [SEP]
[CLS] she thought quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so are you going to condition my hair ? [SEP]
[CLS] since you ' ve already washed it , i mean . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked surprised by her apparent change of subject . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` condition ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , stu ##pe ##fied by her request . [SEP]
[CLS] he glanced down at the second bottle sitting next to the sham ##poo . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that it ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and glanced back up at her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes , ' ' she replied , trying very hard to look innocent . [SEP]
[CLS] he put both of her hands in one of his before he reached down for the condition ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew something was up , but he could n ' t figure it out . [SEP]
[CLS] he took the bottle and squeezed some into her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] when he realized what he needed to do , that he would need both hands , he spun her around easily , pressed her back against the tiles and pinned her in place . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re up to something , ' ' he said with his husky voice . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but for the life of me , i ca n ' t figure it out . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she continued to keep her face straight and all the amusement out of her eyes while he massage ##d her scalp with his hands once again . [SEP]
[CLS] he was completely missing the point of the condition ##er , but to win this battle , she was more than willing to sacrifice today . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` mmm ##mm . . . that feels really good , ' ' she said , closing her eyes so he would n ' t see her intent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you know what ' s best ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , rolling her head to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked and she could hear the suspicion in his voice . [SEP]
[CLS] she opened her eyes and looked up at him with wide eyes , her smile growing slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] she waited until he knew she was up to something before she said , ` ` you ' re hands are n ' t going to be able to hold me now , ' ' she said and slipped out of his grasp and spraying the water right at him . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , she had severely under ##est ##imated her opponent . [SEP]
[CLS] his hands might not be able to stop her , but his arms were incredibly strong and he had years of military training on his side . [SEP]
[CLS] she only got away with the initial sting of success before he hand her flipped around and rep ##ined once again , using more of his legs than anything else . [SEP]
[CLS] to make it worse , she was laughing so hard she could n ' t put up a fight , or even hold him away from her as he held her in place and tick ##led her mer ##ci ##lessly , his fingers made more ni ##mble by the condition ##er that helped them slide over her skin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i give up ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she cried out , gasping for air . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i promise to behave ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she begged . [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped and looked down at her , one eyebrow raised in challenge . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` who says i want you to behave ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her surprise was only for a moment before she started laughing once again , charm ##ed by this side of him that she ' d missed so much . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so what do you want ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , not sure she actually wanted him to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hmm ##m . . . . that ' s a loaded question . [SEP]
[CLS] i want you , naked , all weekend , in my bed without any interruption ##s . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] her smile grew broader as he finished his description and her whole body tingle ##d with excitement . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` is that what will happen next weekend ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he kissed her gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hopefully it will happen this weekend as soon as tonight ' s event is finished . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i thought you had that embassy thing tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] is n ' t that why you bought me the second dress ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and leaned his head back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i hate those parties . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the most ted ##ious few hours in existence . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he brought his head down and looked at her with an intensity that had her gasping for breath . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but you ' ll be there tomorrow and i do n ' t have to let you out of bed after that , right ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t help but agree , nodding her head enthusiastically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` well , except for riding , ' ' she clarified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` okay , one ride . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and maybe dinner with my dad ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked . [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lunch ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he contra ##dict ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` deal . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and you ' re naked the entire rest of the weekend , ' ' he commanded . [SEP]
[CLS] she sighed and tilted her head to the side as if considering his request . [SEP]
[CLS] before she could say anything , he grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up , twisting so he could ri ##nse out her hair . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you act like this is up for debate , my beauty . [SEP]
[CLS] it is n ' t . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted his arms and moved her hair around so the condition ##er would ri ##nse out . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so i ' m to be restrained if i do n ' t obey ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , lifting her eyebrows as he shut off the water . [SEP]
[CLS] he stilled , a wolf ##ish grin spreading across his face . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you are a brilliant woman . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he lifted her once again , carrying her out of the shower stall and setting her down on the soft carpet . [SEP]
[CLS] he grabbed a towel and gently dried her off . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think i might have stumbled into something out of my league , ' ' she replied , putting her hand on his head to balance herself . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` ah , but you wo n ' t know until i have you completely at my mercy . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he stood up and looked down at her with that special intensity that never failed to melt her bones . [SEP]
[CLS] she reached up her hand , touching him gently on the cheek with her fingertips . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does that mean you ' ll be at my mercy ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked softly , bending her knee slightly so she could lean against him , the towel hanging useless ##ly by his side . [SEP]
[CLS] she should feel cold with the cooler air from her apartment hitting her wet skin . [SEP]
[CLS] but with rai ##s looking at her with that kind of promise in his eyes , she felt nothing but heat , feeling almost uncomfortably warm . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` absolutely , ' ' he almost whispered , pulling her close and kissing her gently . [SEP]
[CLS] when he released her , she almost skipped into her bedroom to dress , feeling as if her world was perfect now that he had come back here early . [SEP]
[CLS] the whole ' love ' and ' end of relationship ' issues were not going to int ##rud ##e for the next seventy - two hours , she told herself firmly . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced at the clock as she pulled on her slacks and a silk blouse . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you doing today ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her mind already going through her own schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] she had last minute inspections at his house and was going out to supervise all of the last minute setup ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] everything needed to be finished and in place by five o ' clock , she ' d told everyone so she could go to her father ' s place and get herself ready . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i have meetings downtown , ' ' he commented , walking to her closet and pulling out a suit . [SEP]
[CLS] he winked at her as she blinked at his use of her space . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so surprised , and that silly , bu ##bbly feeling in her stomach started up again as she thought of how domestic the two of them seemed to be right now . [SEP]
[CLS] waking up , shower ##ing , getting dressed . . . it was nice , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` coffee ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked and added a bit of mascara to her lashes , then tossed all her makeup into a bag to take with her for the night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` please . [SEP]
[CLS] are you ready to go ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , coming out of her bedroom after her , straightening his tie which he ' d just knotted into a perfect knot . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked around , glancing at the boxes that she ' d set on the sofa earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think so , ' ' she replied warily . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you wearing ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked , noting the boxes and her nervous glance back to him . [SEP]
[CLS] she bit her lip , trying to make up her mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' ll wear the black lace tonight , ' ' she said softly and was rewarded by his triumphant grin . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` does this mean i can send you other presents and you ' ll accept them more easily ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` no ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she replied firmly , shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] give him and inch and he would take a mile , she thought with ex ##as ##peration . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why not ? [SEP]
[CLS] if it gives me pleasure , would you deny me that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed as she poured him a cup of coffee into a travel mug . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think you get too much pleasure as it is , ' ' she replied , refusing to give in on this issue . [SEP]
[CLS] he accepted the coffee but blocked her way . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you know , you ' re going to have to give in on some of the things i give you . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she laughed and leaned back against her counter , holding her own coffee out to the side . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and why would i do that ? [SEP]
[CLS] i think i prefer keeping you on your toes . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he leaned forward , forcing her to lean back slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will win this one , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] you will eventually be dressed only in the clothes i have bought for you and draped in jewels that i have given you . [SEP]
[CLS] and you will love every moment of it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` will i ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked sarcastically . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t think so . [SEP]
[CLS] i prefer being independent . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked down at her carefully , trying to calculate a way to get her to give in to his preferences . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and what if you were in a position in my government that would require you to be dressed in a certain way ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she considered that carefully . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` first of all , i would n ' t accept a position in your government , ' ' she replied . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that would n ' t be very ethical . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m already having a problem because we ' re lovers and you ' re also a client . [SEP]
[CLS] my boss is concerned as well , ' ' she said as a side issue . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` but regardless of that , i would n ' t feel comfortable accepting gifts from a man . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he grinned as if he had a secret . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you ' re going to get over that pretty quickly . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he took her hand and lifted it to his mouth to kiss her knuckles . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` your helicopter await ##s , ' ' he said and pulled her out the door . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i heard that you were n ' t utilizing that this past week . [SEP]
[CLS] would you explain why ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she grabbed her purse , her notes and the bag she ' d been packing all week in preparation for this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need those boxes , ' ' she said , pulling against his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] he opened the door and took her bag off of her shoulder , handing it to a man who was already standing outside of her apartment door . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel glanced back , grabbing the bag because she thought it was falling off of her shoulder . [SEP]
[CLS] when she saw the strange man with the dark , bulky suit , she stumbled slightly , only catching herself when she quickly put her foot behind her . [SEP]
[CLS] the man looked vaguely familiar but she was late and had to grab the boxes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` gerard will get that , rachel , ' ' rai ##s ad ##mon ##ished patiently . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced up at him , at the guard then back to rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i do n ' t . . . ' ' ` ` come along , ' ' he said and took her hand once again . [SEP]
[CLS] the guard waited until they were out the door before entering the apartment to pick up the boxes . [SEP]
[CLS] a moment later , he had the boxes in his arms and was following both of them down the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] the only uncomfortable moment was when she passed by her neighbor ' s door just as the older woman was also leaving her own apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman glared at rachel , then up to rai ##s before sniffing and shaking her head . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was mort ##ified , completely understanding that the woman was irritated because of all the noise she and rai ##s had made overnight . [SEP]
[CLS] the apartments were n ' t the best in the city and the walls were n ' t very thick . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d suspected that their nocturnal activities had been overheard but having evidence of it so b ##lat ##antly in front of her was un ##ner ##ving and embarrassing . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what was all that about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s asked when they were in the elevators alone . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` that ' s margaret . [SEP]
[CLS] she has two kids and shares a wall with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he immediately understood and almost laughed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` and i suppose she did n ' t get very much sleep last night either , eh ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rachel wanted to punch his arm , but she refrain ##ed since his body guard was in front of the two of them . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i think her look explained that her re ##m sleep was deeply disturbed . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he led her outside into the sunshine and rachel blinked before she got her sunglasses in place . [SEP]
[CLS] when she did , she looked around , then stopped in her tracks . [SEP]
[CLS] the two men she ' d seen throughout the week were standing beside a long , black limousine . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped and looked at the two of them , pulling on rai ##s ' hand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do n ' t get in the car , rai ##s , ' ' she whispered and pulled him closer , stepping in front of him as if to guard her . [SEP]
[CLS] the two men looked at each other , then back to her . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s was pulling her to his side , trying to understand . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what ' s wrong , rachel ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked softly . [SEP]
[CLS] since he was trying to pull her to his side , she plastered herself against him , terrified that these men were out to hurt him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` those men , ' ' she whispered , ` ` i ' ve seen them before . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he looked at the two men who heard her despite her whisper . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course you ' ve seen them , ' ' he said gently . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` they have been watching out for your safety while i ' ve been gone . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she blinked and looked up at him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my safety ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she squeak ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` yes . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' re your personal body guards . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she looked back at them , surveying the bulge ##s under their dark suits . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` are they armed ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , terrified of what those bulge ##s might mean . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` of course they are , ' ' he laughed softly , his arm wrapping around her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` get in the car and let ' s talk . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she sensed that he was both amused and irritated , but for the life of her , she could n ' t figure out why . [SEP]
[CLS] she was furious with him . [SEP]
[CLS] how could he have put some thugs on her , trailing her all over the city and countryside , without telling her ! [SEP]
[CLS] she slipped into the back , still watching the two men warily . [SEP]
[CLS] she held her tongue until the door was closed but as soon as they were alone again , she let him have it . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what do you mean they have been assigned to me ? [SEP]
[CLS] i did n ' t consent to being guarded . [SEP]
[CLS] and do you have any idea how terrifying it is to be followed and not know why ? [SEP]
[CLS] those men were n ' t very subtle in their guardians ##hip , or whatever it is that you call it . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] an eyebrow went up with her dia ##tri ##be and he leaned back . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i had no idea that you were aware of their protection . [SEP]
[CLS] they were supposed to be around , but as inc ##ons ##pic ##uous as possible . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stared at him as if he ' d lost his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you arranged for someone to follow me and did n ' t bother to mention anything to me ? [SEP]
[CLS] why would you do that ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s sighed and rubbed his hand over his face . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew that rachel was really upset about this and he was n ' t sure how to app ##ease her without telling her of his plans for her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i need to make sure you are safe , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] and i ' m sorry for not telling you . [SEP]
[CLS] i thought if you knew about the guards , you would be angry with me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] his apology went a long way to easing her anger , but it was still difficult to get over the fact that he had done something behind her back . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked out the window , watching as the city traffic w ##hi ##zz ##ed by outside . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do i need protection ? [SEP]
[CLS] why are n ' t they out there guarding you ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s considered the possible answers he could give her . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , he was as honest as he could be . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` my enemies are dangerous , rachel . [SEP]
[CLS] they would use you to get to me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she rolled her eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m no one , rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when it comes to international politics , i really do n ' t count . [SEP]
[CLS] call off the men , please . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he sighed and shook his head , knowing this was going to cause problems . [SEP]
[CLS] but she was to be protected at all costs . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ca n ' t do that . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he put a finger over her lips to stop her next argument as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` by the way , when you perceive a threat , you damn well better not try and get in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] that ' s what my guards are for . [SEP]
[CLS] you get behind me or them . [SEP]
[CLS] understand ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` what are you talking about ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she asked , her eyes curious as she tried to grasp his meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` back at your apartment building , ' ' he clarified . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` you were nervous about the strange men and you stepped in front of me . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t ever do that again . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she gritted her teeth , not sure why he was being so ob ##sti ##nate about that . [SEP]
[CLS] he noticed her stubborn expression and shook his head . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i will not allow someone to hurt you because you ' re trying to protect me . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she crossed her arms over her chest , her chin ju ##tting out rebellious ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` so . . . ' ' ` ` no arguments , rachel , ' ' he said stern ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` let my men do their jobs . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure what to say about that , but since they ' d arrived at the building with the he ##lip ##ort , she did n ' t have a chance to argue with him . [SEP]
[CLS] but what was she supposed to say ? [SEP]
[CLS] that she would n ' t let anything happen to him ? [SEP]
[CLS] that she loved him too much to lose him ? [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t want to hear things like that . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the kind of man who wanted to be free , to pursue the next woman . [SEP]
[CLS] she hated that , but she could n ' t think of losing him to someone trying to hurt him either . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 7 rachel walked into the stables , her boot ##ed heels almost silent on the dirt and straw that softened the paths for the horses . [SEP]
[CLS] the previous weekend had been id ##yl ##lic and she was excited about seeing him this weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d spent all weekend in each other ' s company , laughing and talking , spending time with her father and just being close . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she was in trouble , knew that she was in love with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a silly love song was going through her mind and she wanted to surprise rai ##s tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to see him , to feel his hands on her tonight . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d missed him last night , felt lonely as she woke up alone in her cold bed without him . [SEP]
[CLS] their plans for her going to dun ##ari this weekend were changed because he had a meeting with the president but that meant he was still coming here this weekend and she would get to see him throughout the whole three days without any other social obligations . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe how much better she felt now that her fear of intimacy was gone , not to mention feeling so much love for rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t believe she could feel so much for one person . [SEP]
[CLS] she loved her dad , but this was a completely different feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to be with rai ##s all the time , to make him laugh and get him to relax more , to listen to his problems and see what she could do to help him . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to curl up on his lap and talk about her own problems , touch his skin and explore his body . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d never felt that way about any other man before . [SEP]
[CLS] but then , she ' d probably always been in love with rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it had started off as friendship when she ' d been a child , but as she ' d grown older , it had blossom ##ed into something more , something deeper . [SEP]
[CLS] she just had n ' t admitted it until now . [SEP]
[CLS] it was dark outside by this time of the night but the lights inside the stables were warm and inviting . [SEP]
[CLS] she stopped by to say hello to do ##lce and give her an apple , then moved on down to greet her father before she headed up to the main house to find rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want her father to find out that she was serious about rai ##s from someone else . [SEP]
[CLS] the light was on in his office and she smiled , wanting to surprise him as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d been delighted to see her out here more often and she suspected that he was aware of her feelings for rai ##s , but had kept silent . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` why do n ' t we just head into one of the stalls , ' ' rachel heard someone say from inside her father ' s office . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel stopped , her feet frozen in place as she tried to recognize the feminine voice . [SEP]
[CLS] was her father involved with another woman ? [SEP]
[CLS] it was about time , she thought with excitement , and a little bit of tre ##pid ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] they ' d been alone for so long , she was n ' t sure how she felt about her dad dating , but she wanted him to be happy . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m busy , lila . [SEP]
[CLS] why do n ' t you come back another time ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] that was n ' t her father ' s voice ! [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped back , wondering why rai ##s was talking with another woman . [SEP]
[CLS] and what was her name ? [SEP]
[CLS] she recognized it , but could n ' t put a face to the voice . [SEP]
[CLS] where had she heard that voice before ? [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` oh , come on , darling . [SEP]
[CLS] we always have so much fun together . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s looked down at the woman with long dark hair and too much makeup . [SEP]
[CLS] what had he seen in this woman before ? [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t anything like rachel , but then again , neither had any of the other women he ' d dated over the last decade . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d tried to find a substitute , but none had matched the real thing . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel was light and beauty , laughter and desire so strong he could n ' t believe he ' d settled for pale substitutes instead of the real thing . [SEP]
[CLS] she was so much more in all ways than these women . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` lila , i have work to do , ' ' he said , trying to be kind , but wanting to get rid of her . [SEP]
[CLS] he was thinking that he could get his pilot out here and be in rachel ' s bed in less than forty - five minutes if he moved quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d have to check with her to make sure she was free since he ' d arrived a day earlier than he ' d anticipated . [SEP]
[CLS] she might need to work tonight and he did n ' t want to do anything to interfere . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , when they married , she would n ' t have these issues unless she wanted them . [SEP]
[CLS] he smiled just thinking about rachel in his home , in his bed back in dun ##ari . [SEP]
[CLS] his body actually hardened at the idea of rachel growing large with their children . [SEP]
[CLS] damn he wanted her ! [SEP]
[CLS] for life and not just for a short affair . [SEP]
[CLS] he had no idea what rachel had in mind , but he ' d talk with her about it as soon as he saw her again . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted things settled between them and no more of this temporary , weekend stuff they ' d been having together . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted her all the time , by his side and at his table as well as in his bed at night . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i love the way you respond so willingly , ' ' lila pu ##rred , feeling his response and happily assuming it was because of her suggestion . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s looked up , not sure what the woman was talking about . [SEP]
[CLS] then he noticed the way she was looking down and he quickly shook his head as she approached him . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` this is n ' t what you . . . ' ' he stopped when she pressed her body against him , plaster ##ing her glossy lips over his . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel felt like someone had just stabbed her in the stomach . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing rai ##s with another woman in his arms , with her lips on his and her body pressing against his hard one just the way she wanted to do , the way she ' d been anticipating doing with him only moments ago , felt like the most brutal betrayal she could imagine . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also at that moment that rai ##s looked up from the woman in his arms to spy her in the doorway . [SEP]
[CLS] the first moment she ' d spotted the two in each other ' s arms , she wanted to just hide , pretend like she had n ' t seen anything . [SEP]
[CLS] but that was n ' t an option now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i ' m sorry , ' ' she whispered , fighting the tears that sprang to her eyes almost instantly . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` i should have knocked . ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she stepped back out of her dad ' s office and closed the door . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked to the right and the left , not really sure what she could do to escape . [SEP]
[CLS] she knew she just needed to get out of there as fast as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] she turned to the left , heading for her car . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t even stop by her father ' s cottage to say hello to him , just needing to get away from rai ##s and his house and everything about him right now . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` rachel wait ! ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] she heard rai ##s call out to her . [SEP]
[CLS] his voice spurred her on and she sprinted down the center of the stables towards her car . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t see him , did n ' t want to hear his explanations . [SEP]
[CLS] if he was even going to offer one . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d known going into this relationship that rai ##s was n ' t a man who stayed with one woman . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d seen him with so many women over the years and she ' d ignored the warning signs . [SEP]
[CLS] rai ##s loved women . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a con ##sum ##mate lover and competitor who played to win . [SEP]
[CLS] she rushed out , digging her keys out of her pocket and pressing the remote to unlock her car door . [SEP]
[CLS] she heard solid footsteps behind her and made her feet move faster . [SEP]
[CLS] the tears were blinding her though and she stumbled on something . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully she was able to recover and reach her car . [SEP]
[CLS] she dove inside just as rai ##s reached her but she locked the doors before he could open it . [SEP]
[CLS] she started the engine and drove off , un ##con ##cer ##ned that he saw her tears , knew how hurt she was . [SEP]
[CLS] she was beyond trying to hide from him now . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d broken down every single defense she had , and even some she had n ' t been aware she ' d built up and now she had nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] she sped away , un ##car ##ing about anything but putting space between herself and rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the woman in her dad ' s office even looked like her ! [SEP]
[CLS] her long , dark hair was styled similarly , but not exactly like hers and she was the same height and about the same weight . [SEP]
[CLS] the other woman had larger breasts though . [SEP]
[CLS] was that what he wanted in a woman ? [SEP]
[CLS] she hated him so much , but she was disgusted with herself just as much for trusting him , for believing in the fairy tale , especially with a man like rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d known better ! [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d told herself over and over that he was n ' t the man for her . [SEP]
[CLS] that he was n ' t the man for any woman who wanted a mono ##gam ##ous relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] he did n ' t have it in him , she thought . [SEP]
[CLS] why had she even started dreaming about a future with him ? [SEP]
[CLS] that just made everything hurt even more . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d believed him when he said those sweet , delicious words . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d stupid ##ly translated those into words of love and commitment . [SEP]
[CLS] well , now she knew better . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a hard lesson to learn but at least she ' d figured it out . [SEP]
[CLS] she drove down the highway , surprised at how many people were traveling on interstate 66 at this time of the night . [SEP]
[CLS] she glanced at the clock on her dashboard and was surprised to find that it was only seven - thirty in the evening . [SEP]
[CLS] somehow , with everything that had happened , she thought it was later . [SEP]
[CLS] so much had happened in the last thirty minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d only arrived at rai ##s ' farm at seven o ' clock after getting off of work at five o ' clock . [SEP]
[CLS] on the drive out , traffic had been heavy but she had n ' t cared , too excited at the prospect of seeing rai ##s , maybe having dinner with him and . . . yes , she had wanted to spend the night with him . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t even cared that her father would have known about it . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t sure she could stand the questions if he found out about this huge mess . [SEP]
[CLS] the tears were so heavy with that thought , she could barely see so she pulled off of the highway , not wanting to hurt anyone because she could n ' t drive properly . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled into a coffee shop and parked , taking deep breaths to try and calm herself down . [SEP]
[CLS] she just needed a cup of tea , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked in her rearview mirror , da ##bbed some powder onto her red cheeks , added a touch of lipstick , then felt at least present ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] inside , she ordered her tea and ignored the odd looks from the woman behind the counter . [SEP]
[CLS] she took her cardboard cup and found an empty chair in the corner , wanting to just curl up and hide . [SEP]
[CLS] but she ' d been doing that for years . [SEP]
[CLS] ever since she was eighteen years old and knew that her feelings for rai ##s were deeper than just friendship , she ' d hidden from him . [SEP]
[CLS] deep down , she guessed she knew this kind of thing might happen . [SEP]
[CLS] sure enough , as soon as rai ##s discovered her , he came after her with all of that charm and confidence , that male ##ness that just lured women towards him . [SEP]
[CLS] the tea was too hot to drink but it felt warm in her hands and helped the numb ##ness that was slowly taking over . [SEP]
[CLS] she supposed that was the body ' s way of avoiding the cr ##ip ##pling pain . [SEP]
[CLS] if she could n ' t feel anything , she would n ' t hurt so badly . [SEP]
[CLS] the tears were falling , but since she was n ' t driving , she was n ' t trying to focus so she was n ' t aware of the tears . [SEP]
[CLS] they fell on her hand and her cup , onto her sweater and melted into the fabric to disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] every time she thought of rai ##s , her mind jumped back to him in that other woman ' s arms . [SEP]
[CLS] when he ' d pulled back from her kiss , there had been her red lipstick on his mouth and he ' d looked horrible . [SEP]
[CLS] she wanted to hate him , but it hurt too much to think about him right now . [SEP]
[CLS] just sip the tea , she told herself . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t think about rai ##s , or the other woman . [SEP]
[CLS] do n ' t think about the future or the past , or anything . [SEP]
[CLS] just take each moment separately . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sob , she realized that she could n ' t even lose herself in work right now because her only client was rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d hi ##jack ##ed her career and , until now , she had n ' t cared because it had been nice to just be around him . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been happy organizing his parties and acting as his hostess . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d been proud of the work he was accomplish ##ing during those events and had been excited that they ' d gone off so well . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t go back to work , she thought sadly . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have anything to do now . [SEP]
[CLS] for the past several weeks , her whole life had rev ##olved around rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d have to quit her job , find another one within the industry because derrick would be furious that she would n ' t work with rai ##s any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d even be angry that she ' d become personally involved with a client , which was a big no - no in the industry and for derrick ' s employees especially . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' d told her what would happen so nothing was a surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d broken so many rules , she could n ' t even count them , she realized . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d just been happily going about her life , pretending that things would all work out in the end . [SEP]
[CLS] and they had n ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] she picked up her tea and carried it back to her car . [SEP]
[CLS] she started to unlock the door so she could drive to her apartment , but she hesitated . [SEP]
[CLS] did she really want to go back to her apartment ? [SEP]
[CLS] sleep in the bed where she and rai ##s had made love ? [SEP]
[CLS] could she do it ? [SEP]
[CLS] no , she thought with a pain that shot through her body . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to see her apartment just yet . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t do it . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled open the door and considered her options . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a friday night , where could she go ? [SEP]
[CLS] she drove down the street a ways and found a hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] she parked in the lot , picked up her luke ##war ##m tea and walked into the lobby . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t even sure about the name , just walked up to the desk clerk and asked for a room . [SEP]
[CLS] the man behind the counter must have seen something on her face because he did n ' t ask any questions , just quickly clicked on his computer and brought up a room . [SEP]
[CLS] within moments , her credit card had been charged and a plastic key card handed to her . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` do you need help with your luggage ? ' ' [SEP]
[CLS] he asked gently . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel only shook her head and bit her lip so she would n ' t start crying again . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` thank you , ' ' she whispered . [SEP]
[CLS] she took the key and followed the man ' s instructions , going to the elevator and the fifteenth floor . [SEP]
[CLS] inside the room , she did n ' t even turn on the lights . [SEP]
[CLS] she simply curled up in the overs ##tu ##ffed chair by the window and let the tears flow down her cheeks once again . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , she did n ' t even try to stop them , allowing them to just flow as they came . [SEP]
[CLS] rachel stared out at the night , watching the traffic flow on the major streets . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t aware of the traffic slowing down , and then by the early hours of the morning , the traffic was almost non - existent . [SEP]
[CLS] she was n ' t aware of the planes taking off and landing at reagan national airport , and then by midnight they slowed to a halt as well . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t see any of it , her mind not even thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] she cried , she went numb and cried some more . [SEP]
[CLS] when the sun rose over the horizon , she blinked and cried some more . [SEP]
[CLS] she ordered room service , asking for coffee to be delivered to her room . [SEP]
[CLS] when she could n ' t sit on the chair anymore , she showered , but putting her clothes back on again was n ' t the most pleasant feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t have an alternative though . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sigh , she picked up her purse and walked out into the hallway . [SEP]
[CLS] she still did n ' t want to go home , wanting to avoid life for a little while longer . [SEP]
[CLS] she was being a coward , but facing her apartment would hurt too much . [SEP]
[CLS] this was n ' t what she signed up for , she thought as she unlocked her car and slipped into the driver ' s seat . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled her phone out and realized that it had run out of power . [SEP]
[CLS] no wonder she had n ' t heard it last night , she thought as she plug ##ged it in and started her engine . [SEP]
[CLS] as she turned it on again , she glanced at the message indicator . [SEP]
[CLS] she almost started crying again when she saw that there were fifteen messages from rai ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] she could n ' t listen to them now so she skipped through those . [SEP]
[CLS] when she reached the end , she found several from her father as well . [SEP]
[CLS] she dialed his number and waited , relieved when his voice mail picked up . [SEP]
[CLS] she did n ' t want to talk to him right now , tired of crying and knowing that he would cause her to start up again with his gentle questions . [SEP]
[CLS] ` ` hi dad , it ' s me . [SEP]
[CLS] i just wanted you to know that i ' m okay . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m just . . . . well , i ' m okay , ' ' she said and pressed the end button before her voice cracked and he knew that she really was n ' t okay . [SEP]
[CLS] she ' d just pulled out of the parking lot when her phone rang again . [SEP]
[CLS] she looked down at the screen and saw that it was rai ##s calling from his office , so she pressed the ' ignore ' button and turned left . [SEP]
[CLS] she had n ' t eaten since lunch yesterday , but she still was n ' t hungry . [SEP]
[CLS] she pulled up to a fast food restaurant and ordered another cup of coffee , then drove out again . [SEP]
[CLS] she supposed she needed to head back to her apartment at least for a change of clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] driving into her parking lot , she scanned the other cars , wondering if her dad or rai ##s might have come by to talk to her . [SEP]
[CLS] but no one was around except for the familiar cars that were normally here . [SEP]
